Here's a story with diverse vocabulary and narrative elements: The Unexpected Journey of Eleanor Blackwood When the autumn winds whispered through the decrepit manor's corridors, Eleanor Blackwood discovered an peculiar artifact tucked behind a loose panel in her grandmother's study. The object—a brass compass with intricate engravings depicting constellations—seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy that made her fingertips tingle. Eleanor, a pragmatic archaeologist who typically scoffed at tales of the supernatural, found herself inexplicably drawn to the device. Its needle spun erratically, ignoring magnetic north in favor of some unknown destination. The rational part of her mind suggested selling it to a collector or donating it to the university museum, but something—perhaps the same intuition that had guided her through treacherous dig sites—urged her to investigate further. As she scrutinized the compass under her desk lamp, the shadows in the room began to undulate and writhe. The air grew thick with the scent of petrichor, despite the clear skies outside. Without warning, the floor beneath her feet dissolved into a swirling vortex of iridescent light. When the world stopped spinning, Eleanor found herself standing in a marketplace that defied physics. Floating lanterns illuminated stalls that twisted impossibly through multiple dimensions. Merchants with kaleidoscope eyes and shimmer-scale skin hawked their extraordinary wares: bottled dreams, crystallized memories, and maps to places that existed only in theory. "Welcome to the Nexus," proclaimed a towering figure whose form seemed to shift between that of an elderly librarian and a young child. "We've been anticipating your arrival since your grandmother entrusted us with the Wayfinder sixty years ago." Eleanor's mind reeled. Her grandmother had never mentioned anything about this realm, yet the stories she'd told of her travels suddenly took on new meaning. The tales of cities in the clouds and gardens that bloomed with stars weren't mere flights of fancy—they were memories. As she traversed the marketplace, Eleanor encountered a motley crew of dimensional travelers: a quantum physicist who had accidentally discovered the realm while testing string theory, a Victorian time-traveler who had lost his way home, and a being composed entirely of living mathematics who spoke in equations and geometric patterns. The physicist, Dr. Zhang, explained that the compass—or Wayfinder, as it was known here—served as a key to countless realities. "Your grandmother was one of our most celebrated explorers," he revealed, adjusting his spectacles that seemed to contain entire galaxies. "She mapped paths between worlds that we thought impossible to connect." Eleanor spent what felt like weeks learning the intricacies of dimensional navigation. She discovered that each constellation engraved on the Wayfinder corresponded to a different reality, and that the true art lay not in reaching these destinations, but in understanding how they interconnected. During her studies, she uncovered something disturbing: the boundaries between realities were gradually deteriorating. Without intervention, the distinct worlds would eventually collapse into each other, creating a chaotic amalgamation that would destroy the unique characteristics of each dimension. The solution, she learned, required gathering specific artifacts from various realities—objects that resonated with the fundamental frequencies of their native dimensions. These would serve as anchors, reinforcing the boundaries between worlds. And so began Eleanor's grand expedition across realities. She bartered with cloud giants in floating cities, dove into oceans of liquid light to retrieve singing pearls, and navigated forests where the trees grew backwards through time. Each adventure brought new allies, new understanding, and new appreciation for the infinite variety of existence. Months passed in the normal world, though Eleanor experienced years of adventures. When she finally succeeded in gathering all the necessary artifacts and stabilizing the dimensional boundaries, she returned to her grandmother's study mere moments after she'd left. The compass now rested quietly in her palm, its needle pointing steadily north. But Eleanor knew that with the right knowledge—and perhaps a touch of the impossible—it would guide her to new adventures whenever she chose to seek them. She placed the Wayfinder in a velvet-lined box, smiling at the thought of the stories she would one day share with her own grandchildren. Until then, she had a library of research to update and a collection of archaeological theories to completely revolutionize. After all, history takes on an entirely different meaning when you've walked through its living fragments across a thousand different realities.

CHAPTER ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to
say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the
last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which
made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion
there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret,
and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t
think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter
was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact,
Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her
good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the
Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small
son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good
reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a
child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our
story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the
country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work,
and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,
because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
walls.
“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his
car and backed out of number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t
realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again.
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there
wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have
been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared
back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched
the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive —
no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave
himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward
town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to
get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by
something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help
noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.
People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny
clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some
stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his
eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were
whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple
of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was,
and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck
Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt —these people were
obviously collecting for something…yes, that would be it. The traffic
moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings
parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on
the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on
drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight,
though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed
as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even
at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free
morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important
telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until
lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road
to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a
group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He
didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering
excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way
back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few
words of what they were saying.
“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”
“ — yes, their son, Harry —”
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of
it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at
his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost
finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the
receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being
stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of
people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he
wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the
boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying
Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He
didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…but all the same, those
people in cloaks.…
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he
walked straight into someone just outside the door.
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It
was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a
violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the
ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a
squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for
nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at
last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy
day!”
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked
off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a
complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever
that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping
he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he
didn’t approve of imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw
— and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that
morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same
one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal
cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let
himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to
his wife.
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner
all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley
had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.
When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to
catch the last report on the evening news:
“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the
nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls
normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been
hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their
sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most
mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be
any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?”
“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s
not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as
Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of
the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars!
Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until
next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.”
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over
Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the
place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters.…
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It
was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat
nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately,
have you?”
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After
all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.
“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”
“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls…shooting
stars…and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.…”
“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.
“Well, I just thought…maybe…it was something to do with…you
know…her crowd.”
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He
decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son
— he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”
“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”
“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite
agree.”
He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to
bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the
bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still
there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for
something.
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with
the Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well,
he didn’t think he could bear it.
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.
Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting
thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved,
there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The
Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their
kind....He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything
that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect
them.…
How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the
cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as
still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.
It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor
when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before
the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared
so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the
ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was
tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which
were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a
purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His
blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and
his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least
twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in
a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He
was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem
to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,
which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and
muttered, “I should have known.”
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to
be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and
clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it
again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the
Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny
pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If
anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley,
they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the
pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set
off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next
to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was
smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses
exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too,
was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight
bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.
“How did you know it was me?” she asked.
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”
“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said
Professor McGonagall.
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have
passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
“Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d
think they’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed
something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at
the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…
shooting stars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus
Diggle. He never had much sense.”
“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had
precious little to celebrate for eleven years.”
“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no
reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the
streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping
rumors.”
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though
hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A
fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have
disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really
has gone, Dumbledore?”
“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be
thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”
“A what?”
“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”
“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she
didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-
Know-Who has gone —”
“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call
him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I
have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:
Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was
unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing
if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be
frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re
the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I
will never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”
“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said
“The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know
what they’re saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally
stopped him?”
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was
most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold,
hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed
Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that
whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing
another lemon drop and did not answer.
“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort
turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that
Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
“Lily and James…I can’t believe it…I didn’t want to believe it…
Oh, Albus…”
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know…I
know…” he said heavily.
Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not
all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t.
He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re
saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow
broke — and that’s why he’s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s
done…all the people he’s killed…he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just
astounding…of all the things to stop him…but how in the name of heaven
did Harry survive?”
“We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at
her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It
had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because
he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who
told you I’d be here, by the way?”
“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re
going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”
“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only
family he has left now.”
“You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried
Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.
“Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t
find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him
kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry
Potter come and live here!”
“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and
uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written
them a letter.”
“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back
down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this
in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a
legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day
in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in
our world will know his name!”
“Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of
his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous
before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even
remember! Can you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away
from all that until he’s ready to take it?”
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,
swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is
the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though
she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
“Hagrid’s bringing him.”
“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important
as this?”
“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.
“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does
tend to — what was that?”
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a
huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride
it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as
wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles
of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of
trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In
his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where
did you get that motorcycle?”
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me.
I’ve got him, sir.”
“No problems, were there?”
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right
before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’
over Bristol.”
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the
bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a
tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped
cut, like a bolt of lightning.
“Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”
“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”
“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one
myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London
Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over
with.”
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’
house.
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He
bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a
very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a
wounded dog.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”
“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief
and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’ James dead —
an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles —”
“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or
we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly
on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his
cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other
two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little
bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously,
and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed
to have gone out.
“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business
staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius
his bike back. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore,
sir.”
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung
himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it
rose into the air and off into the night.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner
he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve
balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed
suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the
corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets
on the step of number four.
“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a
swish of his cloak, he was gone.
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent
and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect
astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets
without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he
slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not
knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream
as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would
spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin
Dudley....He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in
secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in
hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”

Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER TWO
THE VANISHING GLASS
N early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find
their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four
on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was
almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had
seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the
mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there
had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing
different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and
now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a
carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged
and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy
lived in the house, too.
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for
long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the
first noise of the day.
“Up! Get up! Now!”
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.
“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen
and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto
his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a
good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling
he’d had the same dream before.
His aunt was back outside the door.
“Are you up yet?” she demanded.
“Nearly,” said Harry.
“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t
you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”
Harry groaned.
“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.
“Nothing, nothing…”
Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got
slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his
bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used
to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that
was where he slept.
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The
table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as
though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the
second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing
bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise —
unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite
punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look
it, but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but
Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even
smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old
clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was.
Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He
wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the
times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked
about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was
shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember,
and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was
how he had gotten it.
“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t
ask questions.”
Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the
Dursleys.
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the
bacon.
“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his
newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had
more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made
no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen
with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink
face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay
smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked
like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was
difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his
presents. His face fell.
“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s
two less than last year.”
“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here
under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.”
“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing
down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said
quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today.
How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right”
Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he
said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty...thirty...”
“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.
“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All
right then.”
Uncle Vernon chuckled.
“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy,
Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer
it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a
video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and
a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia
came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She
can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.
Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap.
Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for
the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every
year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two
streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and
Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.
“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as
though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg
had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would
be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and
Tufty again.
“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.
“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t
there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t
understand them, like a slug.
“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”
“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.
“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able
to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a
go on Dudley’s computer).
Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.
“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled.
“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.
“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly,
“…and leave him in the car.…”
“That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone.…”
Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had
been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his
face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.
“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your
special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.
“I…don’t…want…him…t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge,
pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin
through the gap in his mother’s arms.
Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said
Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers
Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like
a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs
while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting
in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the
zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think
of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had
taken Harry aside.
“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right
up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business,
anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”
“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly…”
But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it
was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.
Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers
looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors
and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she
left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry,
who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was
already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning,
however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before
Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard
for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it
had grown back so quickly.
Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a
revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The
harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become,
until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit
Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his
great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.
On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found
on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as
usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was
sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from
Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school
buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through
the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside
the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in
mid-jump.
But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being
with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t
school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He
liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry,
the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,
it was motorcycles.
“…roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a
motorcycle overtook them.
“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering
suddenly. “It was flying.”
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right
around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a
mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”
Dudley and Piers sniggered.
“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”
But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the
Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about
anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even
a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with
families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams
at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked
Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a
cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,
except that it wasn’t blond.
Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful
to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who
were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back
on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and
when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have
enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry
was allowed to finish the first.
Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good
to last.
After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in
there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of
lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone.
Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-
crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It
could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed
it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it
was fast asleep.
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the
glistening brown coils.
“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on
the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.
“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass
smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.
“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake.
He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no
company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to
disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom,
where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake
you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it
raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.
It winked.
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then
raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:
“I get that all the time.”
“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure
the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”
The snake nodded vigorously.
“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry
peered at it.
Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
“Was it nice there?”
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read
on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been
to Brazil?”
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made
both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT
THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.
“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught
by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened
so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were
leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls
of horror.
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank
had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out
onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started
running for the exits.
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,
hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.… Thanksss, amigo.”
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?”
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet
tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only
gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except
snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back
in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off
his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But
worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say,
“Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before
starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to
say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair,
and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He
didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were
asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for
some food.
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years,
as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents
had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his
parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long
hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of
green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the
crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He
couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about
them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no
photographs of them in the house.
When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of
some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never
happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or
maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange
strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him
once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry
furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop
without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green
had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple
coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then
walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was
the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.
At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang
hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and
nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.

Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER THREE
LETTERS FROM NO ONE
T he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-
ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the
summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video
camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing
bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her
crutches.
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s
gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and
Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest
of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in
Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the
house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where
he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going
off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be
with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private
school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other
hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought
this was very funny.
“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at
Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”
“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as
horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before
Dudley could work out what he’d said.
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his
Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as
usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and
she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch
television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d
had it for several years.
That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family
in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange
knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried
knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t
looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon
said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst
into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he
looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He
thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.
* * *
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry
went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the
sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags
swimming in gray water.
“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they
always did if he dared to ask a question.
“Your new school uniform,” she said.
Harry looked in the bowl again.
“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”
“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of
Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when
I’ve finished.”
Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat
down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on
his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant
skin, probably.
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses
because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his
newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried
everywhere, on the table.
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
doormat.
“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.
“Make Harry get it.”
“Get the mail, Harry.”
“Make Dudley get it.”
“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three
things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge,
who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked
like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.
Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant
elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who
would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the
library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it
was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:
Mr. H. Potter
The Cupboard under the Stairs
4 Privet Drive
Little Whinging
Surrey
The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and
the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.
Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple
wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake
surrounding a large letter H.
“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are
you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed
Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open
the yellow envelope.
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped
over the postcard.
“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk.…”
“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on
the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out
of his hand by Uncle Vernon.
“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the
letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to
green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within
seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.
“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it
high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line.
For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat
and made a choking noise.
“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”
They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and
Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He
gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.
“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.
“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”
“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter
back inside its envelope.
Harry didn’t move.
“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.
“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley
by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the
kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his
glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack
between door and floor.
“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at
the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t
think they’re watching the house?”
“Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle
Vernon wildly.
“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them
we don’t want —”
Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and
down the kitchen.
“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an
answer…Yes, that’s best…we won’t do anything…”
“But —”
“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when
we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something
he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.
“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had
squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”
“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon
shortly. “I have burned it.”
“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on
it.”
“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from
the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a
smile, which looked quite painful.
“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been
thinking…you’re really getting a bit big for it…we think it might be nice if
you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.
“Why?” said Harry.
“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs,
now.”
The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one
where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that
wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to
move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on
the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The
month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley
had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was
Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his
favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had
once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle,
which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it.
Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room
that looked as though they’d never been touched.
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I
don’t want him in there…I need that room…make him get out...”
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have
given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard
with that letter than up here without it.
Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in
shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been
sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the
greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking
about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the
hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to
be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things
with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted,
“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive
—’”
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down
the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the
ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that
Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a
minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting
stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter
clutched in his hand.
“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at
Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.”
Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he
had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received
his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make
sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry
turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He
stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive
and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept
across the dark hall toward the front door —
“AAAAARRRGH!”
Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy
on the doormat — something alive!
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the
big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been
lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that
Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry
for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry
shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail
had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters
addressed in green ink.
“I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into
pieces before his eyes.
Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and
nailed up the mail slot.
“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if
they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”
“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”
“Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re
not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the
piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t
go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted
through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the
downstairs bathroom.
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he
got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and
back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the
Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises.
On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to
Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of
the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt
Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious
telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to
complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.
“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry
in amazement.
* * *
On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table
looking tired and rather ill, but happy.
“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread
marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”
Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke
and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or
forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys
ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one —
“Out! OUT!”
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the
hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their
faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still
streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling
great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in
five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No
arguments!”
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one
dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the
boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley
was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for
holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer
in his sports bag.
They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask
where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a
sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.
“Shake ’em off…shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did
this.
They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was
howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d
missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so
long without blowing up an alien on his computer.
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the
outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and
damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the
windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.…
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast
the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over
to their table.
“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an
’undred of these at the front desk.”
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:
Mr. H. Potter
Room 17
Railview Hotel
Cokeworth
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out
of the way. The woman stared.
“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and
following her from the dining room.
* * *
“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested
timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what
he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a
forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off
they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field,
halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking
garage.
“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully
late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all
inside the car, and disappeared.
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley
sniveled.
“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on
tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.”
Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday —
and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because
of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of
course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had
given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you
weren’t eleven every day.
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a
long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what
he’d bought.
“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what
looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the
most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there
was no television in there.
“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping
his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his
boat!”
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a
rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below
them.
“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all
aboard!”
It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their
necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours
they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the
way to the broken-down house.
The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind
whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp
and empty. There were only two rooms.
Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four
bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and
shriveled up.
“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a
chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately
agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.
As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from
the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the
filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second
room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle
Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the
softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged
blanket.
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.
Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get
comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were
drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted
dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his
fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and
watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would
remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped
the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four
minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters
when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.
Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like
that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was
the rock crumbling into the sea?
One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty…
ten…nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three…
two…one…
BOOM.
The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the
door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.
HP 1 - Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER FOUR
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
B OOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.
“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding
into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands – now they knew what
had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.
“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”
There was a pause. Then —
SMASH!
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges
and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost
completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled
beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all
the hair.
The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head
just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it
easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.
He turned to look at them all.
“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy
journey.…”
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.
“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was
crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the
beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh
look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.”
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking
and entering!”
“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached
over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent
it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a
corner of the room.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden
on.
“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the
Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I
mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.”
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly
squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large,
sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green
icing.
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the
words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who
are you?”
The giant chuckled.
“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.”
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together.
“I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it
and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he
was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire
there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the
warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his
weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a
copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several
chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from
before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of
sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as
he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley
fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives
you, Dudley.”
The giant chuckled darkly.
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley,
don’ worry.”
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never
tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the
giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m
sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand.
“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m
Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.
“Er — no,” said Harry.
Hagrid looked shocked.
“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.
“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank
back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t
gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’
Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents
learned it all?”
“All what?” asked Harry.
“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”
He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.
The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.
“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this
boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?”
Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after
all, and his marks weren’t bad.
“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and
stuff.”
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I
mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”
“What world?”
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
“DURSLEY!” he boomed.
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that
sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean,
they’re famous. You’re famous.”
“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”
“Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know....” Hagrid ran his fingers through
his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the
boy anything!”
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the
furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable
trembled with rage.
“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter
Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley!
An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?”
“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.
“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.
“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a
wizard.”
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling
wind could be heard.
“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.
“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa,
which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say,
once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else
would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,
addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,
The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:
HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme
Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)
Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all
necessary books and equipment.
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July
31.
Yours sincerely,
Minerva McGonagall,
Deputy Headmistress
Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t
decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it
mean, they await my owl?”
“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand
to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet
another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather
ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his
tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside
down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.
Hagrid
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its
beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came
back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still
ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
“He’s not going,” he said.
Hagrid grunted.
“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.
“A what?” said Harry, interested.
“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like
them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest
Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”
“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,”
said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”
“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?”
“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we
knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh,
she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school —
and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning
teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a
freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,
they were proud of having a witch in the family!”
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It
seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.
“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married
and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange,
just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up and we got landed with you!”
Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said,
“Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”
“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the
Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’
James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own
story when every kid in our world knows his name!”
“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.
The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.
“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no
idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh,
how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person
ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not
knowin’.”
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.
“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t
tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it.…”
He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It
begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh
don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows —”
“Who?”
“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”
“Why not?”
“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is
difficult. See, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could
go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...”
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.
“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort. ” Hagrid shuddered.
“Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty
years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ‘em, too — some were
afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ‘cause he was gettin’ himself
power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare
get friendly with strange wizards or witches…terrible things happened. He
was takin’ over. ‘Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ‘em.
Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon
Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try
takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.
“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever
knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is
why You-Know-Who never tried to get ‘em on his side before…probably
knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the
Dark Side.
“Maybe he thought he could persuade ‘em...maybe he just wanted
‘em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where
you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He
came ter yer house an’ — an’ —”
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and
blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.
“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’
nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway….
“You-Know-Who killed ‘em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry
of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I
suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never
wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary
cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took
care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you,
an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill
’em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’
wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you
was only a baby, an’ you lived.”
Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s
story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more
clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered
something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.
Hagrid was watching him sadly.
“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders.
Brought yeh ter this lot….”
“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost
forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to
have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were
clenched.
“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something
strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured —
and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying
it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all
they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I
expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end —”
But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered
pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a
sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one
more word….”
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded
giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the
wall and fell silent.
“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down
on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”
“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried
ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry,
see…he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?
“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had
enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his
time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter
ours. Some of ‘em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve
done if he was comin’ back.
“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his
powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him,
Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I
dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him,
all right.”
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes,
but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had
been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d
spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and
Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into
warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d
once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had
always been able to kick him around like a football?
“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I
don’t think I can be a wizard.”
To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared
or angry?”
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…every
odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had
happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s
gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach…dreading going to
school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow
back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge,
without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on
him?
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was
positively beaming at him.
“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll
be right famous at Hogwarts.”
But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to
Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he
needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —”
“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,”
growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer
mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he
won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change,
an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus
Dumbled—”
“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO
TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.
But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and
whirled it over his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT —
ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at
Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a
sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his
hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his
back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his
trousers.
Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the
other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door
behind them.
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.
“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work
anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a
pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.
“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he
said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was
allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one
o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.”
“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.
“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled,
ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’
everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,
Dumbledore.”
“Why were you expelled?”
“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid
loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.
“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I
think I still got a couple o’ doormice in one o’ the pockets.”

Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER FIVE
DIAGON ALLEY
H arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
“It was a dream, he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called
Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open
my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.”
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his
heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good
dream.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”
He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of
sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed
sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper
held in its beak.
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large
balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked
it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid,
who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to
attack Hagrid’s coat.
“Don’t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak
fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”
“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
“What?”
“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”
Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches
of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally,
Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.
“Knuts?”
“The little bronze ones.”
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his
leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then
he flew off through the open window.
Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’
buy all yer stuff fer school.”
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He
had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy
balloon inside him had got a puncture.
“Um — Hagrid?”
“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last
night…he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”
“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching
his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”
“But if their house was destroyed —”
“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us
is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I
wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”
“Wizards have banks?”
“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.
“Goblins?”
“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never
mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer
anything yeh want ter keep safe — ‘cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.”
Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff
fer him. Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust
me, see.”
“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear
now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired
was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another
boat.
“Flew,” said Hagrid.
“Flew?”
“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now
I’ve got yeh.”
They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to
imagine him flying.
“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another
of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would
yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”
“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled
out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they
sped off toward land.
“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.
“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as
he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And
then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter
get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper,
the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked
to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had
so many questions in his life.
“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered,
turning the page.
“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop
himself.
“’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’
course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.
Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every
morning, askin’ fer advice.”
“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”
“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still
witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”
“Why?”
“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to
their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid
folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the
street.
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little
town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice
as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like
parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles
dream up, eh?”
“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you
say there are dragons at Gringotts?”
“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”
“You’d like one?”
“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”
They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five
minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he
called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.
People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats
and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.
“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.
Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.
“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”
Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night
before, and read:

“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.
“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.
Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to
know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an
ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and
complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as
they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined
with shops.
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to
do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,
hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could
sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary
people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath
them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might
this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry
hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have
thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so
far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.
“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s
a famous place.”
It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out,
Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t
glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record
shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact,
Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.
Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women
were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was
smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old
bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low
buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know
Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a
glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”
“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his
great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.
“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can
this be —?”
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter…what
an honor.”
He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized
his hand, tears in his eyes.
“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The
old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.
Hagrid was beaming.
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment,
Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”
“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”
“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”
“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name,
Dedalus Diggle.”
“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell
off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”
“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at
everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands
again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.
A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of
his eyes was twitching.
“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be
one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”
“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand,
“c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”
“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”
“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor
Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it,
eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your
equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,
m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought.
But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself.
It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid
managed to make himself heard over the babble.
“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”
Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led
them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there
was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor
Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”
“Is he always that nervous?”
“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was
studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand
experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a
nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the
students, scared of his own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?”
Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile,
was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.
“Three up…two across…” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.
The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a
small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were
facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a
cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”
He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the
archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway
shrink instantly back into solid wall.
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest
shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-
Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer
money first.”
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in
every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at
once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A
plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed,
saying, “Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.…”
A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying
Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy.
Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window
with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new
Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes,
shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never
seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes,
tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles,
globes of the moon.…
“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the
other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a
uniform of scarlet and gold, was —
“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the
white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than
Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed,
very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were
facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon
them:
Enter, stranger, but take heed
Of what awaits the sin of greed,
For those who take, but do not earn,
Must pay most dearly in their turn.
So if you seek beneath our floors
A treasure that was never yours,
Thief, you have been warned, beware
Of finding more than treasure there.
“Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they
were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on
high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing
coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There
were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins
were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the
counter.
“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some
money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”
“You have his key, sir?”
“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his
pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over
the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched
the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.
“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.
The goblin looked at it closely.
“That seems to be in order.”
“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said
Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What
in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”
The goblin read the letter carefully.
“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have
someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the
dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook
toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?”
Harry asked.
“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret.
Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter
tell yeh that.”
Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected
more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit
with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little
railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came
hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some
difficulty — and were off.
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry
tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was
impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because
Griphook wasn’t steering.
Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them
wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage
and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged
even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and
stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,
“what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”
“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me
questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”
He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a
small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the
wall to stop his knees from trembling.
Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing
out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins.
Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.
“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.
All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known
about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often
had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time
there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.
“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver
Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough.
Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe
for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,
please, and can we go more slowly?”
“One speed only,” said Griphook.
They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air
became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went
rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to
see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him
back by the scruff of his neck.
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently
with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.
“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked
through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.
“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.
“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty
grin.
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security
vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see
fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty.
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying
on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry
longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.
“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way
back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside
Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full
of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a
pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole
life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.
“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward
Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind
if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them
Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam
Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the
lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing
on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam
Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his
head, and began to pin it to the right length.
“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street
looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m
going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years
can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll
smuggle it in somehow.”
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.
“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.
“No,” said Harry.
“Play Quidditch at all?”
“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could
be.
“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my
house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”
“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know
I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in
Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”
“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more
interesting.
“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the
front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at
two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy
didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t
he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and
less every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the
school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,
and ends up setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you?
Where are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going
into the matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were
our kind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you?
They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways.
Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s
your surname, anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you
done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the
boy, hopped down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought
him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
“What’s up?” said Hagrid.
“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills.
Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as
you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s
Quidditch?”
“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not
knowin’ about Quidditch!”
“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the
pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.
“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be
allowed in —”
“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were —
he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw
what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.
Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the
only ones with magic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum!
Look what she had fer a sister!”
“So what is Quidditch?”
“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle
world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on
broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
“School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’
duffers, but —”
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not
a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-
Who was one.”
“Vol-, sorry —You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”
“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and
Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as
paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers
of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in
them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild
to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away
from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your
Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying
and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”
“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in
the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’
anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more
study before yeh get ter that level.”
Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says
pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion
ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the
Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible
smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff
stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the
walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the
ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of
some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver
unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black
beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.
“Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday
present.”
Harry felt himself go red.
“You don’t have to —”
“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a
toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’
like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls,
they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”
Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had
been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now
carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her
head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just
like Professor Quirrell.
“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a
lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place
fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”
A magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking
forward to.
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the
door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand
lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they
stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair
that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a
very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just
occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled
neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck
prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some
secret magic.
“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must
have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got
quickly off the spindly chair.
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining
like moons through the gloom of the shop.
“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.
“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon.
Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems
only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a
quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink.
Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven
inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I
say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of
course.”
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost
nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.
“And that’s where…”
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a
long, white finger.
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly.
“Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the
wrong hands…well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the
world to do.…”
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.…Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.
“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when
you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still
got the pieces, though,” he added brightly.
“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look.
“Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with
silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”
“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.
“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to
finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his
head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a
powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail
feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the
same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.
And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s
wand.”
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring
between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting
around the shelves, taking down boxes.
“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap
on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.”
Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but
Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.
“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”
Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was
snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches,
springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”
Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was
waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the
spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves,
the happier he seemed to become.
“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match
here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination
— holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”
Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He
raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty
air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and
clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good.
Well, well, well…how curious…how very curious…”
He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown
paper, still muttering, “Curious…curious…
“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.
“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single
wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand,
gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you
should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave
you that scar.”
Harry swallowed.
“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these
things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember…I think we must
expect great things from you, Mr. Potter….After all, He-Who-Must-Not-
Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.”
Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much.
He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them
from his shop.
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made
their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the
Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down
the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on
the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages,
with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator,
out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when
Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.
“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to
eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange,
somehow.
“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.
Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday
of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.
“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in
the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander…but I don’t know
anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous
and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what
happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”
Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows
he wore a very kind smile.
“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at
the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s
hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a
great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.
“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, “ he said. “First o’ September — King’s
Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a
letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me….See yeh soon, Harry.”
The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid
until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the
window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.

Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER SIX
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-
QUARTERS
H arry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was
now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt
Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to
do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half
terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were
empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a
bit depressing after a while.
Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had
decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic.
His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into
the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.
It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because
Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep,
Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the
wall, counting down to September the first.
On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt
and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went
down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on
television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley
screamed and ran from the room.
“Er — Uncle Vernon?”
Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.
“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to
Hogwarts.”
Uncle Vernon grunted again.
“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”
Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.
“Thank you.”
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually
spoke.
“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all
got punctures, have they?”
Harry didn’t say anything.
“Where is this school, anyway?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled
the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.
“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven
o’clock,” he read.
His aunt and uncle stared.
“Platform what?”
“Nine and three-quarters.”
“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine
and three-quarters.”
“It’s on my ticket.”
“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them.
You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re
going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”
“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things
friendly.
“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to
have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”
Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and
nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he
didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on
the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had
everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and
then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later,
Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt
Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped
Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry
thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the
platforms with a nasty grin on his face.
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your
platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have
built it yet, do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine
over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and
in the middle, nothing at all.
“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile.
He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive
away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry.
What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny
looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.
He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine
and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get
annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate,
Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there
wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters.
Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over
the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts
and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station
with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large
owl.
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like
tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if
he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand
between platforms nine and ten.
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he
caught a few words of what they were saying.
“— packed with Muggles, of course —”
Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was
talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a
trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.
Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped
and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.
“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother.
“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, who
was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go…”
“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you
go first.”
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and
ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as
the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large
crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last
backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.
“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.
“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you
call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?”
“Sorry, George, dear.”
“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin
called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second
later, he had gone — but how had he done it?
Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was
almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.
There was nothing else for it.
“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.
“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.”
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin,
and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to
—”
“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.
“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the
barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared
you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if
you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”
“Er — okay,” said Harry.
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very
solid.
He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to
platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash
right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his
cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer
— he wouldn’t be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a
foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash —
It didn’t come…he kept on running…he opened his eyes. A scarlet
steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign
overhead said Hogwarts’ Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him
and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering
crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs.
Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and
the scraping of heavy trunks.
The first few carriages were already packed with students, some
hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over
seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty
seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my
toad again.”
“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around
him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty
compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then
started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it
up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it
painfully on his foot.
“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed
through the barrier.
“Yes, please,” Harry panted.
“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”
With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a
corner of the compartment.
“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.
“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s
lightning scar.
“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you —?”
“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry.
“What?” said Harry.
“Harry Potter.” chorused the twins.
“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”
The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red.
Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door.
“Fred? George? Are you there?”
“Coming, Mom.”
With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.
Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could
watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were
saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.
“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him
and began rubbing the end of his nose.
“Mom — geroff” He wriggled free.
“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the
twins.
“Shut up,” said Ron.
“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.
“He’s coming now.”
The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed
into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver
badge on his chest with the letter P on it.
“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have
got two compartments to themselves —”
“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of
great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.”
“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said
the other twin. “Once —”
“Or twice —”
“A minute —”
“All summer —”
“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.
“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins.
“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear,
well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.”
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the
twins.
“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one
more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or —”
“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”
“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”
“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”
“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”
“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins
already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”
Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.
“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station?
Know who he is?”
“Who?”
“Harry Potter!”
Harry heard the little girl’s voice.
“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....”
“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something
you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”
“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.”
“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so
polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”
“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who
looks like?”
Their mother suddenly became very stern.
“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he
needs reminding of that on his first day at school.”
“All right, keep your hair on.”
A whistle sounded.
“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto
the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and
their younger sister began to cry.
“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”
“We’ll send you a Hogwarts’ toilet seat.”
“George!”
“Only joking, Mom.”
The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and
their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until
it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train
rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap
of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be
better than what he was leaving behind.
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded
boy came in.
“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite
Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry
and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked.
Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.
“Hey, Ron.”
The twins were back.
“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s
got a giant tarantula down there.”
“Right,” mumbled Ron.
“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and
George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”
“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door
shut behind them.
“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.
Harry nodded.
“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,”
said Ron. “And have you really got — you know…”
He pointed at Harry’s forehead.
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.
“So that’s where You-Know-Who —?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”
“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.
“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”
“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments,
then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked
quickly out of the window again.
“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second
cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the
pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they
like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin
are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”
“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the
sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up
to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was
captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around
a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really
funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no
big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with
five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old
rat.”
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which
was asleep.
“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up.
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t
aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.”
Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much,
because he went back to staring out of the window.
Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to
afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month
ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and
never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.
“…and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a
wizard or about my parents or Voldemort —”
Ron gasped.
“What?” said Harry.
“You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both
shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people —”
“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said
Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got loads to
learn.…I bet,” he added, voicing for the first time something that had been
worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.”
“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle
families and they learn quick enough.”
While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of
London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They
were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the
corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,
“Anything off the cart, dears?”
Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears
went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went
out into the corridor.
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now
that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as
many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars.
What she did have were Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best
Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes,
Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen
in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and
paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and
tipped it onto an empty seat.
“Hungry, are you?”
“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were
four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always
forgets I don’t like corned beef..”
“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go on
—”
“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much
time,” he added quickly, “you know, with five of us.”
“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to
share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting
there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and
candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate
Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that
nothing would surprise him.
“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.”
“What?”
“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards,
inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I’ve got
about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It
showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose,
and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was
the name Albus Dumbledore.
“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.
“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I
have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”
Harry turned over his card and read:
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS
C onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore
is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in
1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work
on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys
chamber music and tenpin bowling.
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that
Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.
“He’s gone!”
“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron.
“He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…
do you want it? You can start collecting.”
Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be
unwrapped.
“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,
people just stay put in photos.”
“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed.
“Weird!”
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card
and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs
than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t
keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana,
but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was
scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.
“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they
say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the
ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you
can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-
flavored one once.”
Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a
corner.
“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got
toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was
even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t
touch, which turned out to be pepper.
The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder.
The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark
green hills.
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-
faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in.
He looked tearful.
“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”
When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps
getting away from me!”
“He’ll turn up,” said Harry.
“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him…”
He left.
“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad
I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t
talk.”
The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.
“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said
Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more
interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look…”
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-
looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at
the end.
“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —”
He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open
again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She
was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.
“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a
bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.
“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl
wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.
“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”
She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.
“Er — all right.”
He cleared his throat.
“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”
He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray
and fast asleep.
“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very
good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked
for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise
when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the
very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our
course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m
Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”
She said all this very fast.
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face
that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.
“Harry Potter,” said Harry.
“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course
— I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern
Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great
Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”
“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.
“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could
if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be
in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far
the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw
wouldn’t be too bad....Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad.
You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.
“Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw
his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he
knew it was a dud.”
“What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.
“Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I
don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin.”
“That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,”
said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off houses. “So what do your oldest
brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?”
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school.
“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing
something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s
been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the
Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.”
Harry stared.
“Really? What happened to them?”
“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught.
My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round
Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd.
’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case
You-Know-Who’s behind it.”
Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a
prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed
this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more
comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.
“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.
“Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed.
“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best
game in the world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls
and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been
to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money.
He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the
compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless
boy, or Hermione Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it
was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry
with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry
Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them
were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the
pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly,
noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco
Malfoy.”
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.
Draco Malfoy looked at him.
“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My
father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children
than they can afford.”
He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding
families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making
friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.
“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he
said coolly.
Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale
cheeks.
“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re
a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what
was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys
and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.”
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.
“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt,
because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.
“But we don’t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our
food and you still seem to have some.”
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt
forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible
yell.
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk
deep into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle
swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew
off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they
thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d
heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over
the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked
closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.”
And so he had.
“You’ve met Malfoy before?”
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.
“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the
first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said
they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father
didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione.
“Can we help you with something?”
“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to
the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t
been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!”
“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her.
“Would you mind leaving while we change?”
“All right — I only came in here because people outside are
behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione
in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you
know?”
Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was
getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky.
The train did seem to be slowing down.
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black
robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath
them.
A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in
five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken
to the school separately.”
Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale
under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets
and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed
their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry
shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of
the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over
here! All right there, Harry?”
Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now!
Firs’ years follow me!”
Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to
be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry
thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the
boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over
his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”
There was a loud “Oooooh!”
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black
lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling
in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of
little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed
into their boat by Neville and Hermione.
“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right
then — FORWARD!”
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the
lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the
great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer
to the cliff on which it stood.
“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff;
they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain
of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a
dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle,
until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out
onto rocks and pebbles.
“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking
the boats as people climbed out of them.
“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they
clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at
last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the
huge, oak front door.
“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle
door.

Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER SEVEN
THE SORTING HAT
T he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-
green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought
was that this was not someone to cross.
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.
“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”
She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could
have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with
flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make
out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the
right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor
McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.
They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually
have done, peering about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-
term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great
Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important
ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house
common room.
“The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points.
At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house
cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of
the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as
you can while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was
fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously
tried to flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor
McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.
“How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron.
“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was
joking.”
Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole
school? But he didn’t know any magic yet —what on earth would he have
to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He
looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.
No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering
very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d
need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous,
never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys
saying that he’d somehow turned his teacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes
fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come
back and lead him to his doom.
Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the
air — several people behind him screamed.
“What the —?”
He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had
just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,
they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at
the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little
monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second
chance —”
“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he
deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a
ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?”
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first
years.
Nobody answered.
“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About
to be Sorted, I suppose?”
A few people nodded mutely.
“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old house, you
know.”
“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s
about to start.”
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated
away through the opposite wall.
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and
follow me.”
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into
line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked
out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors
into the Great Hall.
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It
was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair
over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These
tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the
hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor
McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line
facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of
faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.
Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver.
Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a
velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “Its
bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A
History.”
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the
Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently
placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she
put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely
dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought
wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall
was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was
complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide
like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:
“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,
But don’t judge on what you see,
I’ll eat myself if you can find
A smarter hat than me.
You can keep your bowlers black,
Your top hats sleek and tall,
For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
And I can cap them all.
There’s nothing hidden in your head
The Sorting Hat can’t see,
So try me on and I will tell you
Where you ought to be.
You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart;
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil;
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
if you’ve a ready mind,
Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind;
Or perhaps in Slytherin
You’ll make your real friends,
Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends.
So put me on! Don’t be afraid!
And don’t get in a flap!
You’re in safe hands (though I have none)
For I’m a Thinking Cap!”
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed
to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.
“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll
kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”
Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than
having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without
everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t
feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had
mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been
the one for him.
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of
parchment.
“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool
to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on
the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments
pause —
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit
down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving
merrily at her.
“Bones, Susan!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to
sit next to Hannah.
“Boot, Terry!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
The table second from the left clapped this time; several
Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown,
Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left
exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.
“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was
Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought
they looked like an unpleasant lot.
He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being
picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to
be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley
to think they liked him.
“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but
at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-
haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole
minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
“Granger, Hermione!”
Her mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on
her head.
“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do
when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just
sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall
jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d
better get back on the train?
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was
called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to
decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran
off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to
“MacDougal, Morag.”
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his
wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,
“SLYTHERIN!”
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased
with himself.
There weren’t many people left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…,
“Parkinson”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks,
Sally-Anne”…, and then, at last —
“Potter, Harry!”
As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little
hissing fires all over the hall.
“Potter, did she say?”
“The Harry Potter?”
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was
the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he
was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult.
Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, A my
goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s
interesting….So where shall I put you?”
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could
be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on
the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure —
better be GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took
off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so
relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that
he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his
hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got
Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The
ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just
plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him
sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned
back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat
Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten
out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the
only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry
spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky
Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
And now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas,
Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor
table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He
was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a
second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair
next to him.
“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across
Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall
rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just
realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the
students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more
than to see them all there.
“Welcome,” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before
we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are:
Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
“Thank you!”
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t
know whether to laugh or not.
“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.
“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world!
But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”
Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled
with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:
roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and
steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas,
carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been
allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that
Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a
bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all
delicious.
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching
Harry cut up his steak.
“Can’t you —?”
“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I
don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced
myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost
of Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me
about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost
began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t
going at all the way he wanted.
“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His
whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a
hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick
flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the house championship
this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins
have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost
unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost
sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with
silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see,
didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great
interest.
“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the
food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A
moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you
could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam
doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding…
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their
families.
“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t
tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for
him.”
The others laughed.
“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.
“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but
the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept
trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but
nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for
dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles
when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let
go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They
were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should
have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be
magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he
bought me my toad.”
On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking
about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn,
I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something
into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”;
“You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —
”).
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the
High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor
McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his
absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked
nose, and sallow skin.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past
Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot
across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.
“What is it?” asked Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off
was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he
didn’t like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to
— everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the
Dark Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him
again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got
to his feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and
watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden
to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember
that as well.”
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley
twins.
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you
all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.
Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam
Hooch.
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on
the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a
very painful death.”
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because
he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the
forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might
have told us prefects, at least.”
“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried
Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become
rather fixed.
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a
fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high
above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we
go!”
And the school bellowed:
“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
Teach us something please,
Whether we be old and bald
Or young with scabby knees,
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,
For now they’re bare and full of air,
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
So teach us things worth knowing,
Bring back what we’ve forgot,
just do your best, we’ll do the rest,
And learn until our brains all rot.”
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley
twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore
conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he
was one of those who clapped loudest.
“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do
here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering
crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs
were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He
was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the
corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led
them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging
tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet,
and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they
came to a sudden halt.
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them,
and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at
him.
“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He
raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”
A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”
There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide
mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking
sticks.
“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What
fun!”
He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.
“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!”
barked Percy.
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking
sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of
armor as he passed.
“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off
again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t
even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman
in a pink silk dress.
“Password?” she said.
“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to
reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville
needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room,
a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the
boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously
in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung
with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up.
Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.
“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
“Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”
Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he
fell asleep almost at once.
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very
strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept
talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it
was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it
got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully —
and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then
Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became
high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating
and shaking.
He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he
didn’t remember the dream at all.
HP 1 - Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER EIGHT
THE POTIONS MASTER
T here, look.”
“Where?”
“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”
“Wearing the glasses?”
“Did you see his face?”
“Did you see his scar?”
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the
next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look
at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry
wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his
way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on
a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember
to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked
politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t
really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to
remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot.
The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was
sure the coats of armor could walk.
The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one
of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right
direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick
staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop
wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you
with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and
screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker,
Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on
their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through
a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds
corridor on the third floor. He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure
they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock
them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who
was passing.
Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored
creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled the
corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and
she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch
knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except
perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the
ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many
to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the
classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found
out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every
Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the
movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the
greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch
called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the
strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the
most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by
a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen
asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach,
leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled
down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed
up.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who
had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first
class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an
excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite
right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them
a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic
you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class
will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all
very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they
weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and
started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only
Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor
McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and
gave Hermione a rare smile.
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense
Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.
His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward
off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to
get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him
by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome
zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when
Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the
zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for
another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the
Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that
Quirrell was protected wherever he went.
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind
everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like
him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so
much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally
managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without
getting lost once.
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on
his porridge.
“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of
Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if
it’s true.”
“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall
was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a
huge pile of homework the day before.
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but
it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred
owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling
the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages
onto their laps.
Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew
in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the
owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered
down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto
Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:
Dear Harry,
I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and
have a cup of tea with me around three?
I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with
Hedwig.
Hagrid
Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the
back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to,
because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had
happened to him so far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that
Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he
knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was
colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy
enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the
walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like
Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
“Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.”
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind
their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His
eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They
were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of
potionmaking,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they
caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of
keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving
here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will
really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its
shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human
veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.…I can teach you how to
bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch
of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged
looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat
and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead.
“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added
powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at
Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the
air.
“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.
Snape’s lips curled into a sneer.
“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”
He ignored Hermione’s hand.
“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find
me a bezoar?”
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go
without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a
bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were
shaking with laughter.
“I don’t know, sir.”
“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?”
Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had
looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to
remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?
Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.
“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and
wolfsbane?”
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon
ceiling.
“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though,
why don’t you try her?”
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus
winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.
“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter,
asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as
the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of
a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and
wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.
Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the
noise, Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for
your cheek, Potter.”
Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson
continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple
potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching
them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone
except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to
look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of
acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had
somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their
potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes.
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville,
who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned
in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.
“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with
one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before
taking the cauldron off the fire?”
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.
“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he
rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.
“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills?
Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s
another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron
kicked him behind their cauldron.
“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very
nasty.”
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s
mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for
Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much?
“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and
George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the
grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden
forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside
and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back,
Fang — back.”
Hagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door
open.
“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”
He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an
enormous black boarhound.
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging
from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the
corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who
bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was
clearly not as fierce as he looked.
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water
into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. I
spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke
their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told
Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee
and drooled all over his robes.
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old
git.”
“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang
sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me
everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”
Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told
Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.
“But he seemed to really hate me.”
“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”
Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his
eyes when he said that.
“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot
— great with animals.”
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked
up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a
cutting from the Daily Prophet:
GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST
Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely
believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault
that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.
“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if
you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this
afternoon.
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried
to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.
“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my
birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!”
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s
eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read
the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier
that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you
could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been
what the thieves were looking for?
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets
weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry
thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to
think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in
time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that
he didn’t want to tell Harry?

Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER NINE
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
H arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than
Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year
Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put
up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice
pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying
lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin
would be learning together.
“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To make a
fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything
else.
“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron
reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he
is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”
Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly
about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long,
boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping
Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus
Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the
countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen
about the time he’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom.
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron
had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their
dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game
with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron
prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the
players move.
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his
grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had
good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of
accidents even with both feet on the ground.
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville
was. This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not
that she hadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid
with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through
the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything
that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was
very pleased when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the
mail.
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that
Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl was always
bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at
the Slytherin table.
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother.
He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large
marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget things —
this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it
tight like this and if it turns red — oh…” His face fell, because the
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “…you’ve forgotten
something….”
Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco
Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall
out of his hand.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a
reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble
quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
“What’s going on?”
“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the
table.
“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle
behind him.
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors
hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It
was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they
marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite
side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying
darkly in the distance.
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks
lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley
complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to
vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and
yellow eyes like a hawk.
“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand
by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.”
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs
stuck out at odd angles.
“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch
at the front, “and say ‘Up!’”
“UP” everyone shouted.
Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the
few that did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and
Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when
you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that
said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms
without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting
their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been
doing it wrong for years.
“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground,
hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and
then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle
— three — two —”
But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the
ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s
lips.
“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up
like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his
scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip
sideways off the broom and —
WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on
the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and
started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.
“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s all
right, up you get.”
She turned to the rest of the class.
“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing!
You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before
you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with
Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
“Did you see his face, the great lump?”
The other Slytherins joined in.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.
“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-
faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”
“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out
of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped
talking to watch.
Malfoy smiled nastily.
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how
about — up a tree?”
“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his
broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering
level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it,
Potter!”
Harry grabbed his broom.
“No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to
move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the
broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed
through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of
fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being
taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a
little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the
ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy
looked stunned.
“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!”
“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped
the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face
and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry
called.
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.
“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass ball
high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and
then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down —
next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind
whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he
stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to
pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the
Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.
“HARRY POTTER!”
His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall
was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —”
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her
glasses flashed furiously, “— how dare you — might have broken your
neck —”
“It wasn’t his fault, Professor —”
“Be quiet, Miss Patil —”
“But Malfoy —”
“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces
as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode
toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted
to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something
wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without
even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t
even lasted two weeks. He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What
would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor
McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and
marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe
she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but
allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant.
His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others
becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s
bag.
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the
door and poked her head inside.
“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a
moment?”
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going
to use on him?
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who
came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused.
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they
marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
“In here.”
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was
empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the
blackboard.
“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which
clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall
slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.
“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.”
Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
“Are you serious, Professor?”
“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a
natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a
broomstick, Potter?”
Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but
he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming
back to his legs.
“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor
McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley
couldn’t have done it.”
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at
once.
“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall
explained.
“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking
around Harry and staring at him. “Light —speedy — we’ll have to get him
a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep
Seven, I’d say.”
“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the
first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in
the face for weeks.…”
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.
“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my
mind about punishing you.”
Then she suddenly smiled.
“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an
excellent Quidditch player himself.”
“You’re joking.”
It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had
happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had
a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all
about it.
“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the
youngest house player in about —”
“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt
particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.
“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone,
Wood wants to keep it a secret.”
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and
hurried over.
“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on
the team too — Beaters.”
“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,”
said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going
to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when
he told us.”
“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new
secret passageway out of the school.”
“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we
found in our first week. See you.”
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less
welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to
the Muggles?”
“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve
got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course
nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full
of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and
scowl.
“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you
want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never
heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”
“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second,
who’s yours?”
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.
“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy
room; that’s always unlocked.”
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean,
you’re my second?”
“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually,
getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he
added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real
wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each
other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he
expected you to refuse, anyway.”
“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”
“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.
“Excuse me.”
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.
“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.
“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —”
“Bet you could,” Ron muttered.
“— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think
of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to
be. It’s really very selfish of you.”
“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.
“Good-bye,” said Ron.
All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry
thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling
asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all
evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better
dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very
good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and
Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On
the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness
— this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.
“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept
across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor
common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all
the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the
portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t
believe you’re going to do this, Harry.”
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink
bathrobe and a frown.
“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”
“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a
prefect, he’d put a stop to this.”
Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat
Lady and climbed through the hole.
Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron
through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about
yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you’ll lose all
the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching
Spells.”
“Go away.”
“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when
you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so —”
But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the
portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an
empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione
was locked out of Gryffindor tower.
“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.
“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going to
be late.”
They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione
caught up with them.
“I’m coming with you,” she said.
“You are not.”
“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch
me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop
you, and you can back me up.”
“You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly.
“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. I heard something.”
It was a sort of snuffling.
“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,
fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I
couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.”
“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it
won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.”
“How’s your arm?” said Harry.
“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it in
about a minute.”
“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see
you later —”
“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t want
to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.”
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and
Neville.
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that
Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.”
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use
the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned
them all forward.
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the
high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.
Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and
tiptoed toward the trophy room.
Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases
glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and
statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,
keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his
wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.
“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just
raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.
“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved
madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried
silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had
barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy
room.
“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably
hiding.”
“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began
to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch
getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a
run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled
right into a suit of armor.
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the
gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung
around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in
the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going —
they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden
passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom,
which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall
and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and
spluttering.
I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her
chest, “I — told — you.”
“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,” said Ron, “quickly as
possible.”
“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize that,
don’t you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was
going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her
that.
“Let’s go.”
It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a
dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a
classroom in front of them.
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.”
Peeves cackled.
“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut.
Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”
“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”
“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his
eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”
“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this
was a big mistake.
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS
OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!”
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.
“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door,
“We’re done for! This is the end!”
They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward
Peeves’s shouts.
“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand,
tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!”
The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it,
shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell
me.”
“Say ‘please.’”
“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”
“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his
annoying singsong voice.
“All right — please.”
“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t
say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves
whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.
“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll be
okay — get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of
Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute. “What?”
Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment,
he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of
everything that had happened so far.
They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a
corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why
it was forbidden.
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog
that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.
Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in
their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry
knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden
appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that,
there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d
take Filch.
They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran,
they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to
look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but
they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as
possible between them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they
reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.
“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their
bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the
portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and
collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed,
looked as if he’d never speak again.
“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked
up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one
does.”
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you
see what it was standing on.
“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too
busy with its heads.”
“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously
guarding something.”
She stood up, glaring at them.
“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been
killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along,
wouldn’t you.
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he
climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something…What had
Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you
wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little
package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
HP 1 - Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER TEN
HALLOWEEN
M alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed,
by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed
dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a
lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it
was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what
it was without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what
lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never
going near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was
such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they
really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great
delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s
attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large
screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was
in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and
dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had
hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of
the parcel.
Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:
DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want
everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver
Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your
first training session.
Professor McGonagall
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to
read.
“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never
even touched one.”
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in
private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they
found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the
package from Harry and felt it.
“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a
mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time,
Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.”
Ron couldn’t resist it.
“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two
Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two
Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the
same league as the Nimbus.”
“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half
the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have
to save up twig by twig.”
Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s
elbow.
“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.
“Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.
“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
“Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter.
And what model is it?”
“A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at
the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here
that I’ve got it,” he added.
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at
Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion.
“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the
marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be
on the team.…”
“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came
an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the
stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.
“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day.
It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying
under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning
to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what
he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus
Two Thousand at last.
“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s
bedspread.
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought
it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long
tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near
the top.
As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the
dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before.
Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the
spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the
field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry
of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except
that they were fifty feet high.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his
broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped
in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The
Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
“Hey, Potter, come down!”
Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate
under his arm. Harry landed next to him.
“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall
meant…you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this
evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand,
even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three
of them are called Chasers.”
“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball
about the size of a soccer ball.
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the
Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a
goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops.
Follow me?”
“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to
score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks
with six hoops, isn’t it?”
“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.
“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.
“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper
— I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the
other team from scoring.”
“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to
remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what
are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.
“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”
He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These
two are the Bludgers.”
He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller
than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to
escape the straps holding them inside the box.
“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of
the Bludgers.
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at
Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his
nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their
heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it
to the ground.
“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the
crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to
knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each
team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side
from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So —
think you’ve got all that?”
“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards
the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry
reeled off.
“Very good,” said Wood.
“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping
he sounded offhand.
“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing
worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you.
And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”
“— unless they crack my head open.”
“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers
— I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a
large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.
“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most
important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and
difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and
out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other
team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team
an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why
Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the
Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three
months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get
some sleep.
“Well, that’s it any questions?”
Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it
was doing it that was going to be the problem.
“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully
shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try
you out with a few of these.”
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few
minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls
as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half
an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood
happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if
you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for
England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”
Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch
practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could
hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two
months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His
lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had
mastered the basics.
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking
pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick
announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making
objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him
make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the
class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which
was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron,
however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell
whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to
either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.
“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been
practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of
books as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying
the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard
Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a
buffalo on his chest.”
It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the
feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.
Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it
— Harry had to put it out with his hat.
Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.
“Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a
windmill.
“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-
gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”
“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and
said, “Wingardium Leviosa!”
Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above
their heads.
“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see
here, Miss Granger’s done it!”
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they
pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was
Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see
that she was in tears.
“I think she heard you.”
“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve
noticed she’s got no friends.”
Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all
afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,
Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that
Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered
the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their
minds.
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a
thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the
candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden
plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor
Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his
face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped
against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you
ought to know.”
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding
from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.
“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories
immediately!”
Percy was in his element.
“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if
you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years
coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”
“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.
“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron.
“Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”
They passed different groups of people hurrying in different
directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused
Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.
“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”
“What about her?”
“She doesn’t know about the troll.”
Ron bit his lip.
“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.”
Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way,
slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’
bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps
behind them.
“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He
crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.
“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the
dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”
“Search me.”
Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s
fading footsteps.
“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his
hand.
“Can you smell something?”
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old
socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls
of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left,
something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows
and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite
gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched
on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny
feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge
wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its
long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.
“The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”
“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.
They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll
wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab
the key, slam the door, and lock it.
“Yes!”
Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage,
but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts
stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber
they’d just chained up.
“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.
“Hermione!” they said together.
It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they
have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key,
fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking
as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the
sinks off the walls as it went.
“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he
threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around,
blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw
Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.
“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and
he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe
hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly
snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.
“Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her
toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall,
her mouth open with terror.
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.
It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to
escape.
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid:
He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the
troll’s neck from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but
even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and
Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped – it had gone
straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry
clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or
catch him a terrible blow with the club.
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own
wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first
spell that came into his head: “Wingardium Leviosa!”
The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up
into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto
its owner’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face,
with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was
standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.
It was Hermione who spoke first.
“Is it — dead?”
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, I think it’s just been knocked out.”
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was
covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
“Urgh — troll boogers.”
He wiped it on the troll’s trousers.
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look
up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,
someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A
moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,
closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took
one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a
toilet, clutching his heart.
Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron
and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s
mind.
“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall,
with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing
with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you
in your dormitory?”
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor.
He wished Ron would put his wand down.
Then a small voice came out of the shadows.
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.”
“Miss Granger!”
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with
it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.”
Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to
a teacher?
“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up
its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to
come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them.
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the
three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of
tackling a mountain troll on your own?”
Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the
last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending
she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing
out sweets.
“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,”
said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not
hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing
the feast in their houses.”
Hermione left.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have
taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points.
Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”
They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they
had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the
troll, quite apart from anything else.
“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.
“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”
“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted.
“Mind you, we did save her.”
“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in
with her,” Harry reminded him.
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
“Pig snout,” they said and entered.
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the
food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door,
waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them
looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend.
There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other,
and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
HP 1 - Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER ELEVEN
QUIDDITCH
A s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The
mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.
Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from
the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field,
bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous
beaverskin boots.
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be
playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus
Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the
house championship.
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that,
as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that
he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn’t know
which was worse — people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling
him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He
didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her,
what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do.
She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a
very interesting read.
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a
Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup
match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players,
and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that
although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to
vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since
Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much
nicer for it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them
were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them
up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were
standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard.
Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it
wouldn’t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces
caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed
to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.
“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”
It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.
“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said Snape.
“Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.”
“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape
limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?”
“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly.
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron,
and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry
and Ron’s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy
(“How will you learn?”), but by asking her to read it through, they got the
right answers anyway.
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to
take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of
Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if
he could have it.
“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an idea that
Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no
answer. He knocked again. Nothing.
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He
pushed the door ajar and peered inside – and a horrible scene met his eyes.
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes
above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was
handing Snape bandages.
“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to keep
your eyes on all three heads at once?”
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but —
“POTTER!”
Snape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly
to hide his leg. Harry gulped.
“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”
“GET OUT! OUT!”
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from
Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.
“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the
matter?”
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.
“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried to
get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going
when we saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d bet my
broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!”
Hermione’s eyes were wide.
“No — he wouldn’t, she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he
wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”
“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or
something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past
Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?”
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question.
Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his
mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a
few hours – but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg
wasn’t easy to forget.
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full
of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone
looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”
“I don’t want anything.”
“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.
“I’m not hungry.”
Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field.
“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers
are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.”
“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his
sausages.
By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands
around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might
be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on
sometimes.
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham
fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large
banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President,
and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion
underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the
paint flashed different colors.
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were
changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in
green).
Wood cleared his throat for silence.
“Okay, men,” he said.
“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.
“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”
“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.
“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on
the team last year.”
“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s
had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.”
He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”
“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping
his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field
waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.
“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were
all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking
particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry
thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner
of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for
President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.
“Mount your brooms, please.”
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of
Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too
—”
“JORDAN!”
“Sorry, Professor.”
The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary
for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia
Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to
Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain
Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle
up there — he’s going to sc— no, stopped by an excellent move by
Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s
Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the
field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a
Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding
off toward the goal posts, but he’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his
way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the
Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle,
a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a
speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina
— Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the
Slytherins.
“Budge up there, move along.”
“Hagrid!”
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space
to join them.
“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of
binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd. No
sign of the Snitch yet, eh?”
“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”
“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising
his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting
about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood’s game
plan.
“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood had
said. “We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.”
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-
loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the
Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection
from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to
come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry
dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger
furiously toward Marcus Flint.
“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey
ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the
— wait a moment — was that the Snitch?”
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the
Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had
passed his left ear.
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after
the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck
and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed to have
forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to
watch.
Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball,
wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed —
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below —
Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off
course, Harry holding on for dear life.
“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at
the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden
Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref!
Red card!”
“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.
“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown the red
card and you’re out of the game!”
“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.
Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.
“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the
air.”
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —”
“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.
“I mean, after that open and revolting foul…”
“Jordan, I’m warning you —”
“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which
could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by
Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still
in possession.”
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning
dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden,
frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He
gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He’d never felt
anything like that.
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck
him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their
riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts — he
had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then he realized that his
broom was completely out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t
direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then
making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.
Lee was still commentating.
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet
— passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose
— only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — A no…”
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that
Harry’s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher,
away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He stared
through his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of
his broom…but he can’t have.…”
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His
broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to
hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a wild
jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with
only one hand.
“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus
whispered.
“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t nothing
interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do
that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.”
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but instead of
looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.
“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.
“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands
opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop
under his breath.
“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.
“What should we do?”
“Leave it to me.”
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard,
it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd
was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull
Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they
got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and
circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint
seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape
stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t even stop
to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in
front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and
whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand
onto the hem of Snape’s robes.
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on
fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him
into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape
would never know what had happened.
It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber
back on to his broom.
“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into
Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him
clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the
field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.
“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and the
game ended in complete confusion.
“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howling
twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any
rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor
had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of
this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut,
with Ron and Hermione.
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. He
was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone
on next to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to
tell him. Harry decided on the truth.
“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get
past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying
to steal whatever it’s guarding.”
Hagrid dropped the teapot.
“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.
“Fluffy?”
“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the
pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —”
“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s top
secret, that is.”
“But Snape’s trying to steal it.”
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do
nothin’ of the sort.”
“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind
about Snape.
“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them!
You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw
him!”
“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ know why
Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student!
Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’
concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s
guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel —”
“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel
involved, is there?”
Hagrid looked furious with himself.

Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER TWELVE
THE MIRROR OF ERISED
C hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts
woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and
the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that
they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few
owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver
mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off
again.
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor
common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had
become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst
of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where their
breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their
hot cauldrons.
“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all
those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re
not wanted at home.”
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle
chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish,
ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the
Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get
everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing
Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny,
because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay
on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to
taunting Harry about having no proper family.
It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for
Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before,
making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry
had signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would
probably be the best Christmas he’d ever had. Ron and his brothers were
staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit
Charlie.
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a
large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at
the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head through
the branches.
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”
“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold
drawl from behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money,
Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I
suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what
your family’s used to.”
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
“WEASLEY!”
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.
“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge
hairy face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”
“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said
Snape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t
more. Move along, all of you.”
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering
needles everywhere and smirking.
“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of
these days, I’ll get him —”
“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”
“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell yeh
what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.”
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great
Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with
the Christmas decorations.
“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?”
The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all
around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood
around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with
hundreds of candles.
“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.
“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Harry, Ron,
we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”
“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from
Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand
and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just
before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”
“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you
mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”
“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told yeh
— drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”
“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said
Hermione.
“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry added.
“We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find
him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name
somewhere.”
“I’m sayin’ nothin’, said Hagrid flatly.
“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left
Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since
Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what
Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where
to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a
book. He wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable
Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern
Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.
And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of
thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to
search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them
off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section.
He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there.
Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers
to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he’d never get one.
These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at
Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense
Against the Dark Arts.
“What are you looking for, boy?”
“Nothing,” said Harry.
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.
“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”
Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left
the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask
Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able
to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had
found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for two
weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t
surprising they’d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long
search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their
heads. They went off to lunch.
“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said
Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.”
“And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said
Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”
“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a
time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and
the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the
good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could
spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and
plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even
if they wouldn’t work.
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like
Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like
directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like
everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his
family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a
drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them
to do what he wanted.
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and
they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept
shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t send
me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.”
On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next
day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he
woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile
of packages at the foot of his bed.
“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed
and pulled on his bathrobe.
“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some
presents!”
“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own pile,
which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.
Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper
and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut
wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it
sounded a bit like an owl.
A second, very small parcel contained a note.
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present.
From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence
piece.
“That’s friendly,” said Harry.
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
“Weird!” he said, ‘What a shape! This is money?”
“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
“Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?”
“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink
and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect
any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley
sweater.”
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater
in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his
own, “and mine’s always maroon.”
“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was
very tasty.
His next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate
Frogs from Hermione.
This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very
light. He unwrapped it.
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where
it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.
“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of
Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is
— they’re really rare, and really valuable.”
“What is it?”
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to
the touch, like water woven into material.
“It’s an invisibility cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m
sure it is — try it on.”
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.
“It is! Look down!”
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the
mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head
suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak
over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!”
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,
loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:
Your father left this in my possession before he died.
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.
A Very Merry Christmas to you.
There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the
cloak.
“I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the
matter?”
“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the
cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?
Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was
flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the
cloak quickly out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else
yet.
“Merry Christmas!”
“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large
yellow F on it, the other a G.
“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry’s
sweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.”
“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come
on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.”
“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his
head.
“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I suppose
she thinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid — we know
we’re called Gred and Forge.”
“What’s all this noise?”
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking
disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his
presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred
seized.
“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours,
even Harry got one.”
“I — don’t — want —” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the
sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said George.
“Christmas is a time for family.”
They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side
by his sweater.
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred
fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of
chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and
cranberry sauce – and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the
table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones
the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy
paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just
bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud
of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and
several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped
his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at
a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly
broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched
Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,
finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s
amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of
things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous
balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were
going to end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious
snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they
returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in
his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t
have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas
cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and
watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because
they’d stolen his prefect badge.
It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had
been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed
was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother
him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster.
Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from
under it.
His father’s…this had been his father’s. He let the material flow
over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had
said.
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak
around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and
shadows. It was a very funny feeling.
Use it well.
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open
to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in
the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch
would never know.
Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held
him back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time —
he wanted to use it alone.
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common
room, and climbed through the portrait hole.
“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He
walked quickly down the corridor.
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And
then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d be able to
read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He
set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see
his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating
along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the
sight gave him the creeps.
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping
carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the
library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.
They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled
words in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had no title at all. One
book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the
back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but
he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they
knew someone was there who shouldn’t be.
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the
floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A
large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with
difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall
open.
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was
screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,
unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his
lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down
the corridor outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran
for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked
straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and
streaked off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been
so busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he
was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was
at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be
five floors above there.
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was
wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library Restricted
Section.”
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch
must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and
to his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they
can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the
corner ahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor
and if they came much nearer they’d knock right into him — the cloak
didn’t stop him from being solid.
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left.
It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not
to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their
noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the
wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had
been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything
about the room he had hidden in.
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and
chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper
basket – but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t
look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just
put it there to keep it out of the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate
gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved
around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic
fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved
nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.
He stepped in front of it.
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from
screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously
than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the
mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back
to the mirror.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,
reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his
shoulder — but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was
he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it
reflected them, invisible or not?
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt
the air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections
were so close together, but he felt only air – she and the others existed only
in the mirror.
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes —
her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass.
Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was
crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired
man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his
hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly
touching that of his reflection.
“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the
faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes
like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he
had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first
time in his life.
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back
at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to
fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside
him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did not
fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his
senses. He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore
his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and
hurried from the room.
“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.
“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the
mirror.
“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.
“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able
to show me your other brothers and everyone.”
“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my
house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame
about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why
aren’t you eating anything?”
Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing
them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem
very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was
guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?
“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror
room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much
more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from the
library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”
“No!” Harry hissed. I know it’s here somewhere.”
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite
direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet
were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
“It’s here — just here — yes!”
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around
his shoulders and ran to the mirror.
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.
“See?” Harry whispered.
“I can’t see anything.”
“Look! Look at them all…there are loads of them.…”
“I can only see you.”
“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn’t
see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.
“Look at me!” he said.
“Can you see all your family standing around you?”
“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m
head boy!”
“What?”
“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding
the house cup and the Quidditch cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too.”
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at
Harry.
“Do you think this mirror shows the future?”
“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look
—”
“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.”
“You’re only holding the Quidditch cup, what’s interesting about
that? I want to see my parents.”
“Don’t push me —”
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.
They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.
“Quick!”
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs.
Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking
the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age,
she turned and left.
“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.
Come on.”
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.
“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.
“No.”
“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”
“No…you go…”
“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t go
back tonight.”
“Why not?”
“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve
had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are
wandering around. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into
you? What if you knock something over?”
“You sound like Hermione.”
“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back
in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him.
That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was
walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he
didn’t meet anyone.
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one
of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in
front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all
night with his family. Nothing at all.
Except —
“So — back again, Harry?”
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind
him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get
to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said
Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with
Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the
Mirror of Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”
“How did you know —?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.
“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want…
whatever we want…”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more
or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have
never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley,
who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing
alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither
knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what
they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or
even possible.
“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I
ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will
now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,
remember that. Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and
get off to bed?”
Harry stood up.
“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may
ask me one more thing, however.”
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”
“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”
Harry stared.
“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another
Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will
insist on giving me books.”
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that
Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he
shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.
HP 1 - Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
NICHOLAS FLAMEL
D umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of
Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak
stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what
he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having
nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing
in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,”
said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a
different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry
being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had
caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who
Nicolas Flamel was.
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library
book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere.
Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten
minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two,
because Quidditch practice had started again.
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain
that had replaced the snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys
complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s
side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake
Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite
apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when
he was tired out after training.
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session,
Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just gotten very angry with the
Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their
brooms.
“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s exactly the sort
of thing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be
looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
“Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
“When’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if
we might overtake Slytherin.”
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play
a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason
for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the
end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common
room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the
only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was
very good for her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down
next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.
“What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other
two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.
“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.
“Really break your leg,” said Ron.
“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out,
Gryffindor can’t play at all.”
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had
managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his
legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-
Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor
tower.
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and
performed the countercurse. Neville’s legs sprang apart and he got to his
feet, trembling. “What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over
to sit with Harry and Ron.
“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the library. He
said he’d been looking for someone to practice that on.”
“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Report
him!”
Neville shook his head.
“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled.
“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s used to
walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and
make it easier.”
“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in
Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out.
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate
Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for
Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.
“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat
chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking
Slytherin.”
Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.
“Thanks, Harry…I think I’ll go to bed.…D’you want the card, you
collect them, don’t you?”
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.
“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at
Ron and Hermione.
“I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d
read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen
to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard
Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s
blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”
Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited since
they’d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.
“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’
dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks
before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got
this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”
“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d
looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages,
muttering to herself.
At last she found what she was looking for.
“I knew it! I knew it!”
“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione
ignored him.
“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known
maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”
This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.
“The what?” said Harry and Ron.
“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s
Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will
transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life,
which will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the
centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas
Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his
six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon
with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog
must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to
keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was
after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”
“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said
Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”
“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent
Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six
hundred and sixty-five, is he?”
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying
down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still
discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t
until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered
about Snape and the coming match.
“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the
Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll
really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”
“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more
nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t
too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house
championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would
they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?
Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he
seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even
wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his
own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was
so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the
Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t see how he could — yet he sometimes had
the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms
the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d
ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry
hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes
and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next
to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried,
or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry
know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker
Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were
ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as
Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.
“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”
Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.
“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early
capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor
Hufflepuff too much.”
“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of
the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”
Harry’s heart did a somersault.
“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was
right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There
was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore
was watching.
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams
marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.
“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione. “Look —
they’re off. Ouch!”
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this time?
Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?”
Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty
because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all
her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was
circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor
team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded
Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry
for. See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s the Weasleys,
who’ve got no money — you should be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve
got no brains.”
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.
“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not
daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”
“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and
that’s saying something.”
Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with
anxiety about Harry.
“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—”
“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —”
“What? Where?”
Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps
and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her
mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some money on
the ground!” said Malfoy.
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was
on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then
clambered over the back of his seat to help.
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to
watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice Malfoy and
Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from
the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see
something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next
second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the
Snitch clasped in his hand.
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever
remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.
“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s won! We’ve
won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down
on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn’t
believe it. He’d done it — the game was over; it had barely lasted five
minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on his
shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face.
“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could
hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror...been
keeping busy...excellent...”
Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus
Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling
happier. He’d really done something to be proud of now – no one could say
he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so
sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head,
which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their
shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron
cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and
looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.
Gryffindor in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape ....
And speaking of Snape…
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.
Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the
forbidden forest. Harry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He
recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while
everyone else was at dinner — what was going on?
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.
Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He
followed.
The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone. He
flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he
heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering
beech tree.
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his
broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone.
Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t make out the look on his face, but he
was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were
saying.
“…d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,
Severus…”
“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his voice icy.
“Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.”
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape
interrupted him.
“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?”
“B-b-but Severus, I —”
“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking a
step toward him.
“I-I don’t know what you—”
“You know perfectly well what I mean.”
An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He
steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of hocus-
pocus. I’m waiting.”
“B-but I d-d-don’t —”
“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon, when
you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It
was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as
though he was petrified.
“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.
“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the
back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe
and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll
be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! I’ve waiting for you in the
common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and
stuff from the kitchens.”
“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an
empty room, you wait ’til you hear this....”
He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind
them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.
“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to
force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy
— and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus pocus’ — I reckon there
are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of
enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts
spell that Snape needs to break through —”
“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to
Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.
HP 1 - Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
Q uirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought. In the
weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t
look as though he’d cracked yet.
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still
growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which
surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell
these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started
telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.
Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s
Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her
notes. Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to
do the same.
“Hermione, the exams are ages away.”
“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a
second to Nicolas Flamel.”
“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her. “Anyway,
what are you studying for, you already know it’s an A.”
“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to
pass these exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I
should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into
me.…”
Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same
lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter
holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to
relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood
or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron
spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all
their extra work.
“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing
down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the
first really fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-
not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical
Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are
you doing in the library?”
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He
looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at
once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer
not still lookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”
“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively.
“And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St—”
“Shhhh!” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was
listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”
“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,”
said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —”
“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later, I’m
not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in
here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh —”
“See you later, then,” said Harry.
Hagrid shuffled off.
“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thoughtfully.
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”
“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, who’d had
enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his
arms and slammed them down on the table.
“Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff about
dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From
Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.”
“Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I
ever met him, “ said Harry.
“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon breeding was
outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s
hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back
garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see
the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.”
“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry.
“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and
Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can
tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted
them, to make them forget.”
“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later,
they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called
“Who is it?” before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind
them.
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there
was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat
sandwiches, which they refused.
“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”
“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. “We
were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone
apart from Fluffy.”
Hagrid frowned at him.
“O’ course I can’t,“ he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself.
Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could.
That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts —
I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know
abou’ Fluffy.”
“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do
know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a
warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was
smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione
went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,
apart from you.”
Hagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at
Hermione.
“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he
borrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments…
Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he
ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore
himself did somethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh
yeah, Professor Snape.”
“Snape?”
“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped
protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If
Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find
out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything —
except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren’t you,
Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you?
Not even one of the teachers?”
“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid
proudly.
“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others. “Hagrid, can
we have a window open? I’m boiling.”
“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the
fire. Harry looked at it, too.
“Hagrid — what’s that?”
But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,
underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s —
er…”
“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to
get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a fortune.”
“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the village havin’
a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was
quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.”
“But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said
Hermione.
“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large
book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding
for Pleasure and Profit — it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here.
Keep the egg in the fire, ‘cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an’ when
it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every
half hour. An’ see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I got
there’s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They’re rare, them.”
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.
“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.
But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked
the fire.
So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to
Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.
“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as
evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they
were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry
and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from
Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.
Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.
“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a
dragon hatching?”
“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what
Hagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing—”
“Shut up!” Harry whispered.
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen.
How much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,
Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during
morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their
lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through
the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed
and excited.
“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.
The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it.
Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated
breath.
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The
baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought
it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge
compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the
stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.
It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.
“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to
stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.
“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.
“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks
grow, exactly?”
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from
his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.
“What’s the matter?”
“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a kid
— he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there
was no mistaking him.
Malfoy had seen the dragon.
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next
week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of
their free time in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.
“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”
“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”
They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just
a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his
gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There
were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.
“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at the
dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert!
Norbert! Where’s Mommy?”
“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.
“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s going
to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any
moment.”
Hagrid bit his lip.
“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, I
can’t.”
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. “Charlie.” he said.
“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?”
“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying
dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and
then put him back in the wild!”
“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”
And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to
Charlie to ask him.
The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and
Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone
to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait
hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s
invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed
Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in
a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week.
I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way
Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.
When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was
singing it a lullaby.”
There was a tap on the dark window.
“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll have
Charlie’s answer!”
The three of them put their heads together to read the note.
Dear Ron,
How are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to take the Norwegian
Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will
be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me
next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on
Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark.
Send me an answer as soon as possible.
Love,
Charlie
They looked at one another.
“We’ve got the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It shouldn’t be too
difficult – I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.”
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two
agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.
There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had swollen
to twice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam
Pomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though,
he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if
Norbert’s fangs were poisonous.
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the
day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like it’s
about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of
my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept
threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I
don’t think she believes me — I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch
match, that’s why he’s doing this.”
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this
didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into
a sweat.
“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no oh no —
I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s
going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.”
Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey
came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione. “We
haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only
chance to get rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got the
invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.”
They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged
tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.
“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky stage —
nothin’ I can’t handle.”
When they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes filled with tears,
although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the
leg.
“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he’s
only a baby, after all.”
The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle.
Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t
come quickly enough.
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to
say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about what they had
to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at
Hagrid’s hut because they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in
the entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid
had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid
in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.”
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as
though the teddy was having his head torn off.
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione
covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it
themselves. “Mommy will never forget you!”
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never
knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble
staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another
staircase, then another – even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work
much easier.
“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath
the tallest tower.
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the
crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the
shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each
other ten feet away. A lamp flared.
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had
Malfoy by the ear.
“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin!
Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you —”
“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming — he’s got
a dragon!”
“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I
shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!”
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the
easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into the
cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe
properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.
“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”
“Don’t,” Harry advised her.
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his
crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out
of the darkness.
Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and
Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert
between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry
and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.
At last, Norbert was going…going…gone.
They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as
their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon — Malfoy in
detention — what could spoil their happiness?
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they
stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.”
They’d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.

Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
T hings couldn’t have been worse.
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first
floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other.
Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased
each other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn’t
see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were
cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There
was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their
being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let
alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except
for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well
be packing their bags already.
Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He was
wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.
“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I was
trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch
you, he said you had a drag—”
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor
McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert
as she towered over the three of them.
“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you
were up in the astronomy tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. Explain
yourselves.”
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s
question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said
Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed
Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him
out of bed and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think it’s
funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?”
Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that
this wasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor,
blundering Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and
find them in the dark, to warn them.
“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students out of
bed in one night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss
Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought
Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive
detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to
walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous —
and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.”
“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d
won in the last Quidditch match.
“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily
through her long, pointed nose.
“Professor — please —”
“You can’t —”
“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed,
all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”
A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In
one night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup.
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could
they ever make up for this?
Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his
pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say
to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn.
What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d
done?
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the
house points the next day thought there’d been a mistake. How could they
suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then
the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero
of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple
of other stupid first years.
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the
school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and
Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see
Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and
didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the
other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering,
“Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”
Only Ron stood by him.
“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost
loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.”
“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though,
have they?” said Harry miserably.
“Well — no,” Ron admitted.
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not
to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with
sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to
Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we
going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t
speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they
called him “the Seeker.”
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have as bad a
time as Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would
speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in
class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All the
studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione
kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the
ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart,
memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new
resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an
unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon,
he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew
closer, he heard Quirrell’s voice.
“No — no — not again, please —”
It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved
closer.
“All right — all right —” he heard Quirrell sob.
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom
straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to
cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed
him. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into
the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry
was halfway toward it before he remembered what he’d promised himself
about not meddling.
All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that
Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape
would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have
given in at last.
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on
Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.
“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to
break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”
“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking
Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.
“I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant
three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but
Hermione answered before Harry could.
“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If
we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”
“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back
us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at
Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you
think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him,
Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help
us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more
students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not
supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of
explaining.”
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.
“If we just do a bit of poking around —”
“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.”
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the
names of its moons.
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and
Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.
Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.
Professor McGonagall
Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the
points they’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a
whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, she felt
they deserved what they’d got.
At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the
common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was
already there — and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy
had gotten a detention, too.
“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.
“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t
you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes…hard work and pain are the
best teachers if you ask me….It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die
out…hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the
chains still in my office, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ever needed…
Right, off we go, and don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you
if you do.”
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing.
Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be
something really horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing
them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of
Hagrid’s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.
“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”
Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it
wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch
said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well,
think again, boy — it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken
if you’ll all come out in one piece.”
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his
tracks.
“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as
usual. “We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there —
werewolves, I heard.”
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking
noise.
“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking with
glee. “Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble,
shouldn’t you?”
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel.
He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his
shoulder.
“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All
right, Harry, Hermione?”
“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly,
they’re here to be punished, after all.”
“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. “Bin
lecturin’ them, eh? ‘Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll
take over from here.”
“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he
added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp
bobbing away in the darkness.
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to
hear the note of panic in his voice.
“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely.
“Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”
“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought we’d
be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he’d—”
“—tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled. “Copyin’
lines! What good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get
out. If yeh think yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter
the castle an’ pack. Go on.”
Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then
dropped his gaze.
“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ‘cause it’s
dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks.
Follow me over here a moment.”
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up
high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into
the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the
forest.
“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground?
Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt
badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last
Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put
it out of its misery.”
“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy,
unable to keep the fear out of his voice.
“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with
me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna
split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s
blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at
least.”
“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.
“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me,
Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the
other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right?
Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ if anyone gets in
trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful
— let’s go.”
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a
fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path
while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and
then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue
blood on the fallen leaves.
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
“Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.
“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn,
they’re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running
water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of
unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it
can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — GET
BEHIND THAT TREE!”
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path
behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his
crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something
was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing
along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few
seconds, the sound faded away.
“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’
be.”
“A werewolf?” Harry suggested.
“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said
Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”
They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.
“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”
And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the
waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s
gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s
jaws dropped.
“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”
He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.
“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep,
sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?”
“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.
“There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione
Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, you two.
He’s a centaur.
“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.
“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you learn
much, up at the school?”
“Erm —”
“A bit,” said Hermione timidly.
“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his
head and stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve run
inter yeh, Ronan, ‘cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”
Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward,
then sighed again.
“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has been
for ages past, so it is now.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’ Ronan? Anythin’
unusual?”
“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him
impatiently. “Unusually bright.”
“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home, said
Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?”
Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The
forest hides many secrets.”
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow
again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and
wilder-looking than Ronan.
“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”
“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”
“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’
odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know
anythin’ about it?”
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward.
“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply.
“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see
anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over
their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.
“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a
centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”
“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.
“Oh, a fair few….Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but
they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re deep,
mind, centaurs…they know things…jus’ don’ let on much.”
“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.
“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was
what’s bin killin’ the unicorns – never heard anythin’ like it before.”
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking
nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being
watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.
They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid’s
arm.
“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”
“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I’ll come
back for yeh!”
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood
looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the
rustling of leaves around them.
“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.
“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville…it’s our
fault he’s here in the first place.”
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual.
Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking
twig. What was going on? Where were the others?
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Malfoy,
Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed,
had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had
panicked and sent up the sparks.
“We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two
were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me
an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid
added in a whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you,
an’ we’ve gotta get this done.”
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.
They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until
the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so
thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were
splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been
thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through
the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
“Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched
closer.
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen
anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd
angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark
leaves.
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made
him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.…
Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground
like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The
cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the
animal’s side, and began to drink its blood.
“AAAAAAAAAARGH!”
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The
hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood
was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward
Harry — he couldn’t move for fear.
Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as
though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard
hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry,
charging at the figure.
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a
minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur
was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had
white-blond hair and a palomino body.
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
“Yes — thank you — what was that?”
The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale
sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that
stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.
“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to
Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you
ride? It will be quicker this way.
“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his
front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side
of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their
flanks heaving and sweaty.
“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a
human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”
“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy.
The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”
“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember,
Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not
read what is to come in the movements of the planets?”
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he
was acting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.
Bane kicked his back legs in anger.
“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned
with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like
donkeys after stray humans in our forest!”
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry
had to grab his shoulders to stay on.
“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you
not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that
secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with
humans alongside me if I must.”
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he
could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.
“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved
me from, anyway?”
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in
case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They
made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought
Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a
particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.
“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”
“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the
horn and tail hair in Potions.”
“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said
Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would
commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if
you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something
pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a
cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.”
Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver
in the moonlight.
“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going
to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”
“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long
enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to
full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr.
Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”
“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t
understand who —”
“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to
power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s
heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what
Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: “Some say he died.
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to
die.”
“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”
“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”
Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing
along behind her.
“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The
unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”
“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off
to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”
Harry slid off his back.
“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been
read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those
times.”
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving
Harry shivering behind him.
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to
return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly
shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as
Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire.
He was still shaking.
“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in
the forest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”
“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he
thought Voldemort could hear them.
Harry wasn’t listening.
“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was
furious…he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going
to happen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks
Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the
stars as well.”
“Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry
went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off
... Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy.”
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.
“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who
was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch
you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling
to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of
magic.”
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to
bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.
When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak
folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:
Just in case.
HP 1 - Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
I n years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had
managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to
come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and
there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the
locked door.
It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they
did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the
exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell.
They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them
one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance
across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a
snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken
away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their
necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.
Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his
forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry
couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old
nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a
hooded figure dripping blood in it.
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the
forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron
and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of
Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in
dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much
time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.
Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering
questions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and
they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results
came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their
quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the
rest.
“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as
they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have
learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric
the Eager.”
Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward,
but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and
flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the
tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. “No
more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could
look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly
we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.”
Harry was rubbing his forehead.
“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar
keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”
“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.
“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s
coming….”
Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.
“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as
Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found
out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not
going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England
before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”
Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there
was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to
explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night
and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered
we’d done that one.”
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do
with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the
bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who
ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid
would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy…never…but….
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.
“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.
“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white.
“We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”
“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the
grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon,
and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How
many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law?
Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”
“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across
the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and
sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.
“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a
drink?”
“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.
“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You
know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing
cards with look like?”
“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.
“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head
— that’s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’
he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “What did you talk to
him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?”
“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
“Yeah…he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here…He
asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after…so I told him…an’ I said
what I’d always really wanted was a dragon…an’ then…I can’ remember
too well, ‘cause he kept buyin’ me drinks…Let’s see…yeah, then he said he
had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted…but he had
ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home….So I
told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy.…”
“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked,
trying to keep his voice calm.
“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even
around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how
to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter
sleep —”
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey —
where’re yeh goin’?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they
came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy
after the grounds.
“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that
stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under
that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope
Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop
him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?”
They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the
right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did
they know anyone who had been sent to see him.
“We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang
across the hall.
“What are you three doing inside?”
It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.
“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather
bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as
though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”
Harry swallowed — now what?
“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t,
because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.
“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He
received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London
at once.”
“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”
“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many
demands on his time – ”
“But this is important.”
“Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of
Magic, Potter?”
“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s
about the Sorcerer’s Stone —”
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The
books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them
up.
“How do you know —?” she spluttered.
“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone’s going to
try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. I
don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can
possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.”
“But Professor —”
“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent
down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside
and enjoy the sunshine.”
But they didn’t.
“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall
was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found
out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He
sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when
Dumbledore turns up.”
“But what can we —”
Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.
Snape was standing there.
“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.
They stared at him.
“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd,
twisted smile.
“We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to
say.
“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like
this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t
afford to lose any more points, can it?”
Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them
back.
“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will
personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.
Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.
“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One
of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and
follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”
“Why me?”
“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for
Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Professor
Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong….’”
“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out
for Snape.
“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told
Ron. “Come on.”
But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached
the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor
McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of
enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve
come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from
Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!”
Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said,
“At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady
swung open and Hermione came in.
“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what
I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him,
and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”
“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.
The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were
glittering.
“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the
Stone first.”
“You’re mad!” said Ron.
“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape
have said? You’ll be expelled!”
“SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets
hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was
like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get
expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts!
Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll
leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get
caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the
Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later
than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m
going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to
stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”
He glared at them.
“You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.
“I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it
back.”
“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.
“All — all three of us?”
“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”
“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d
get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and took through my books, there
might be something useful….”
“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”
“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in
secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not
throwing me out after that.”
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.
Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to
Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it.
Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one
of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t
talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.
Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.
“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,
stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He
pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him
for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like
singing.
He ran back down to the common room.
“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three
of us – if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —”
“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room.
Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who
looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom.
“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak
behind his back.
Neville stared at their guilty faces.
“You’re going out again,” he said.
“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to
bed, Neville?”
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t
afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to
sleep.
“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor
will be in even more trouble.”
“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.
I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the
portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”
“Neville, “Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an
idiot —”
“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. I don’t think you should
be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up
to people!”
“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you don’t
know what you’re doing.”
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who
leapt out of sight.
“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m
ready!”
Harry turned to Hermione.
“Do something,” he said desperately.
Hermione stepped forward.
“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”
She raised her wand.
“Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville.
Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His
whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face,
stiff as a board.
Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed
together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them
in horror.
“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.
“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville,
I’m so sorry.”
“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.
“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over
him and pulled on the invisibility cloak.
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a
very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like
Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on
them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking
near the top.
“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but
Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris
turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.
They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to
the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that
people would trip.
“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He
narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see
you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”
He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.
“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around
unseen.”
Harry had a sudden idea.
“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his
own reasons for being invisible.”
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time
and hovered about a foot off the stairs.
“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My
mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re
invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”
“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this
place tonight.”
“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air
again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”
And he scooted off.
“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.
A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor
— and the door was already ajar.
“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past
Fluffy.”
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of
them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other
two.
“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take
the cloak, I won’t need it now.”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.
“We’re coming,” said Hermione.
Harry pushed the door open.
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three
of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t
see them.
“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.
“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”
“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well,
here goes ….”
He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but
from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew
breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to
its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak
and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath
as they approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door
open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”
“No, I don’t!”
“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the
dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and
open.
“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll
just have to drop.”
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his
attention and pointed at himself.
“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how
deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him
asleep.”
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog
growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back
into its deep sleep.
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There
was no sign of the bottom.
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his
fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me,
don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore,
right?”
“Right,” said Ron.
“See you in a minute, I hope …”
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down,
down, down and —
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on
something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It
felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,
which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.
“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the
fall. Come on, Hermione!”
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already
been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm
grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the
plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster
the plant wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,”
snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his
neck. “Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.
“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as
it curled around his chest.
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare…what did Professor Sprout say? — it
likes the dark and the damp.”
“So light a fire!” Harry choked.
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried,
wringing her hands.
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A
WITCH OR NOT?”
“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved
it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had
used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it
loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling
and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull
free.
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as
he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis
— ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”
“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which
was the only way forward.
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of
water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and
Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he
remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If
they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad
enough….
“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.
Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming
from up ahead.
“Do you think it’s a ghost?”
“I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”
“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a
brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of
small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On
the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.
“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.
“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose
if they all swooped down at once…well, there’s no other choice…I’ll run.”
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted
across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him
any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He
pulled the handle, but it was locked.
The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door,
but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora
charm.
“Now what?” said Ron.
“These birds…they can’t be here just for decoration,” said
Hermione.
They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering?
“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged
keys — look carefully. So that must mean…” he looked around the
chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. “…yes —
look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!”
“But there are hundreds of them!”
Ron examined the lock on the door.
“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like
the handle.”
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring
into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the
bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to
catch one.
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a
century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a
minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a
large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and
stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — there — no,
there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one
side.”
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed
into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off
the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from above —
Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it.
Right, NOW!”
Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both,
and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward
and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.
Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.
They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in
his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment
the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered
now that it had been caught twice.
“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.
They nodded. He pulled the door open.
The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But
as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an
astonishing sight.
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the
black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what
looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the
white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering
white chessmen had no faces.
“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across
the room.”
Behind the white pieces they could see another door.
“How?” said Hermione nervously.
“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the
knight’s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the
ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.
“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” The black knight
nodded. Ron turned to the other two.
“This needs thinking about…” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take
the place of three of the black pieces….”
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he
said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good
at chess —”
“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”
“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you
next to him instead of that castle.”
“What about you?”
“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these
words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces
and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and
Hermione took.
“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the
board. “Yes…look…”
A white pawn had moved forward two squares.
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever
he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?
“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The
white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where
he lay quite still, facedown.
“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you
free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”
Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no
mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the
wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in
danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white
pieces as they had lost black ones.
“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me
think…”
The white queen turned her blank face toward him.
“Yes…” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way…I’ve got to be taken.”
“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.
“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices!
I take one step forward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to
checkmate the king, Harry!”
“But —”
“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”
“Ron —”
“Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”
There was no alternative.
“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go —
now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.”
He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron
hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor —
Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged
Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out.
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They
had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear.
With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged
through the door and up the next passageway.
“What if he’s —?”
“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What
do you reckon’s next?”
“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve
put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make
them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”
They had reached another door.
“All right?” Harry whispered.
“Go on.”
Harry pushed it open.
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull
their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in
front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold
with a bloody lump on its head.
“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they
stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”
He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at
what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table
with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up
behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At
the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They
were trapped.
“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.
Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:
Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
One among us seven will let you move ahead,
Another will transport the drinker back instead,
Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;
Second, different are those who stand at either end,
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
Fourth, the second left and the second on the right
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.
Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was
smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a
puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d
be stuck in here forever.”
“But so will we, won’t we?”
“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on
this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us
safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”
“But how do we know which to drink?”
“Give me a minute.”
Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and
down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last,
she clapped her hands.
“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black
fire — toward the Stone.”
Harry looked at the tiny bottle.
“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly
one swallow.”
They looked at each other.
“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab
brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and
past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore,
we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no
match for him, really.”
“But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”
“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his
scar. “I might get lucky again.”
Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and
threw her arms around him.
“Hermione!”
“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”
“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let
go of him.
“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more
important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!”
“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t
you?”
“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round
bottle at the end, and shuddered.
“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.
“No — but it’s like ice.”
“Quick, go, before it wears off.”
“Good luck — take care.”
“GO!”
Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He
turned to face the black flames.
“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle
down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking
his body, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but
dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape. It wasn’t
even Voldemort.
HP 1 - Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
THE MAN WITH TWO FACES
I t was Quirrell.
“You!” gasped Harry.
Quirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all.
“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here,
Potter.”
“But I thought — Snape —”
“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering
treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t
he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to
him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”
Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t.
“But Snape tried to kill me!”
“No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger
accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that
Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds
and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed it before then if
Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.”
“Snape was trying to save me?”
“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted to
referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn’t do it again.
Funny, really…he needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with
Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to
stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular…and what a
waste of time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and
wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.
“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on
Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what
was guarding the Stone.”
“You let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen
what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while
everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only
did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even
manage to bite Snape’s leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting
mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind
Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured,
tapping his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with
something like this…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he
gets back…”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop
him from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the
back. “He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He
suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I
had Lord Voldemort on my side….”
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily
into it.
“I see the Stone…I’m presenting it to my master…but where is it?”
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give.
He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.
“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”
“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at
Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each other. But
he never wanted you dead.”
“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was
threatening you.…”
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.
“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s
instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —”
“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.
“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him
when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of
ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how
wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too
weak to seek it…Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have
let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell
shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to
steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me…
decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me.…”
Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to
Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell
there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.
Quirrell cursed under his breath.
“I don’t understand…is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break
it?”
Harry’s mind was racing.
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he
thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror,
I should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden!
But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without
Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped
and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.
“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”
And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to
come from Quirrell himself.
“Use the boy…Use the boy.…”
Quirrell rounded on Harry.
“Yes — Potter — come here.”
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off.
Harry got slowly to his feet.
“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me
what you see.”
Harry walked toward him.
I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I
see, that’s all.
Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell
that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in
front of the mirror, and opened them again.
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment
later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled
out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and
as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow
— incredibly — he’d gotten the Stone.
“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”
Harry screwed up his courage.
“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented. “I —
I’ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.”
Quirrell cursed again.
“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the
Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?
But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though
Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.
“He lies…He lies.…”
“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth! What
did you just see?”
The high voice spoke again.
“Let me speak to him…face-to-face…”
“Master, you are not strong enough!”
“I have strength enough…for this…”
Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He
couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and
began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away.
Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on
the spot.
Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where
there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most
terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes
and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
“Harry Potter…” it whispered.
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.
“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and
vapor….I have form only when I can share another’s body…but there have
always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds…Unicorn
blood has strengthened me, these past weeks…you saw faithful Quirrell
drinking it for me in the forest…and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be
able to create a body of my own….Now…why don’t you give me that
Stone in your pocket?”
So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs. He
stumbled backward.
“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and
join me…or you’ll meet the same end as your parents…They died begging
me for mercy…”
“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.
Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still
see him. The evil face was now smiling.
“How touching…” it hissed. “I always value bravery….Yes, boy,
your parents were brave…I killed your father first; and he put up a
courageous fight…but your mother needn’t have died…she was trying to
protect you…Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in
vain.”
“NEVER!”
Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed
“SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his
wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his head felt
as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his
might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head
lessened — he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and
saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering
before his eyes.
“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell
lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands
around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet
he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!”
And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let
go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see
they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by
instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face —
“AAAARGH!”
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:
Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain —
his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to
stop him from doing a curse.
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as
tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain
in Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear
Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL
HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry!
Harry!”
He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost,
and fell into blackness, down…down… down….
Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to
catch it, but his arms were too heavy.
He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How
strange.
He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into
view above him.
“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was
Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”
“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said
Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”
“Then who does? Sir, I —”
“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”
Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in
the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to
him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore,
beaming. “What happened down in the dungeons between you and
Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school
knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were
responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it
would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very
hygienic, and confiscated it.”
“How long have I been in here?”
“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most
relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.”
“But sir, the Stone —”
“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor
Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that,
although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”
“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”
“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London
than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just
left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.”
“It was you.”
“I feared I might be too late.”
“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much
longer –”
“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you.
For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has
been destroyed.”
“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Nicolas
Flamel —”
“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite
delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I
have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”
“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”
“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and
then, yes, they will die.”
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to
Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long
day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great
adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As
much money and life as you could want! The two things most human
beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of
choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.”
Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and
smiled at the ceiling.
“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s
gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”
“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things.
Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”
“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back,
isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”
“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps
looking for another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be
killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers
as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his
return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight
what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and
again, why, he may never return to power.”
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt.
Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can
tell me…things I want to know the truth about.…”
“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing,
and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer
your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg
you’ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”
“Well…Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she
tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the
first place?”
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not
now. You will know, one day…put it from your mind for now, Harry. When
you are older…I know you hate to hear this…when you are ready, you will
know.”
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.
“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”
“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort
cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your
mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign…to have
been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will
give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of
hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not
touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by
something so good.”
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the
windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he
had found his voice again, Harry said, “And the invisibility cloak — do you
know who sent it to me?”
“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I
thought you might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things…
your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food
when he was here.”
“And there’s something else…”
“Fire away.”
“Quirrell said Snape —”
“Professor Snape, Harry.”
“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father.
Is that true?”
“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.
Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.”
“What?”
“He saved his life.”
“What?”
“Yes…” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s
minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s
debt…I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he
felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to
hating your father’s memory in peace.…”
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he
stopped.
“And sir, there’s one more thing…”
“Just the one?”
“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”
“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more
brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that’s saying something. You see,
only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be
able to get it, otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking
Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes…Now, enough
questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott’s
Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across
a vomit flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for
them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?”
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then
he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.
“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.
“Absolutely not.”
“You let Professor Dumbledore in….”
“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need
rest.”
“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam
Pomfrey…”
“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”
And she let Ron and Hermione in.
“Harry!”
Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but
Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.
“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so
worried —”
“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really
happened?”
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more
strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything:
Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a
very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told
them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to
die?”
“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? —
‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’”
“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite
impressed at how crazy his hero was.
“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.
“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round —
that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact
Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew —
he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third
floor.”
“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your
father’s cloak and everything?”
“Well, ” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say that’s
terrible — you could have been killed.”
“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man,
Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he
knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had
a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just
taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out
how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face
Voldemort if I could….”
“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly.
“Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points
are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch
match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll
be good.”
At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT” she said firmly.
After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.
I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she
straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can’t I?”
“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she said
stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how
risky feasts could be. “And you have another visitor.”
“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?”
Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was
indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry,
took one look at him, and burst into tears.
“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his face in his
hands. I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only
thing he didn’t know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a dragon
egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a
Muggle!”
“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and
remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found
out somehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found out
even if you hadn’t told him.”
“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the name!”
“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he
stopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name. Please
cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a
Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads.…”
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That
reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”
“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and at last
Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.
“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. ‘course,
he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this.…”
It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it
curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him
from every page were his mother and father.
“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer
photos…knew yeh didn’ have any…d’yeh like it?”
Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He
had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving
him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out
in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin’s winning
the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the
Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody
started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and
Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people
were standing up to look at him.
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died
away.
“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must
trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth
into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are
all a little fuller than they were…you have the whole summer ahead to get
them nice and empty before next year starts.…
“Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and
the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and
twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;
Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred
and seventy-two.”
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin
table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was
a sickening sight.
“Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However,
recent events must be taken into account.”
The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.
“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish
out. Let me see. Yes…
“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley…”
Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad
sunburn.
“…for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many
years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars
overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects,
“My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant
chess set!”
At last there was silence again.
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger…for the use of cool logic in
the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she
had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside
themselves — they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter…” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “…for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award
Gryffindor house sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling
themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-
two points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup
— if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.
Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.
“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It
takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to
stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville
Longbottom.”
Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought
some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted
from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and
cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people
hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.
Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who
couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-
Bind Curse put on him.
“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for
even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin,
“we need a little change of decoration.”
He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became
scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and
a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor
McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry’s eye
and Harry knew at once that Snape’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed
one jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to
normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.
It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at
Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never,
ever forget tonight.
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but
come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good
marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even
Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his
abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid
as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a
shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t have everything in life.
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were
packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes
were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the
holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley
sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed
across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and
laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott’s
Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their
wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine
and three-quarters at King’s Cross Station.
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened
old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in
twos and threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid
wall at once and alarming the Muggles.
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you —
I’ll send you an owl.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.”
People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the
Muggle world. Some of them called:
“Bye, Harry!”
“See you, Potter!”
“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him.
“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry.
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.
“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!”
It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing
at Ron.
“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see —”
“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”
Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.
“Busy year?” she said.
“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.
Weasley.”
“Oh, it was nothing, dear.”
“Ready, are you?”
It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking
furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of
ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking
terrified at the very sight of Harry.
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley.
“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy, we
haven’t got all day.” He walked away.
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
“See you over the summer, then.”
“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking
uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so
unpleasant.
“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was
spreading over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic
at home. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer.…

CHAPTER ONE

THE WORST BIRTHDAY

ot for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at

number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in

the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew

Harry’s room.

“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If you can’t control

that owl, it’ll have to go!”

Harry tried, yet again, to explain.

“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around outside. If I could

just let her out at night —”

“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling

from his bushy mustache. “I know what’ll happen if that owl’s let out.”

He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.

Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud

belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.

“I want more bacon.”
Page 9 of 338
Page 10 of 338

“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia, turning

misty eyes on her massive son. “We must build you up while we’ve got the

chance. . . . I don’t like the sound of that school food. . . .”

“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,” said

Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley gets enough, don’t you, son?”

Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the

kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.

“Pass the frying pan.”

“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry irritably.

The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was

incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the

whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to

her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples.

“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean —”

“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over

the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?”

“But I —”

“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon,

pounding the table with his fist.

“I just —”

“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR

ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!”

Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was

trying to heave Dudley to his feet.

“All right,” said Harry, “all right . . .”

Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and

watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.

Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle

Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any
Page 10 of 338
Page 11 of 338

moment, because Harry Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he

was as not normal as it is possible to be.

Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were

unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry

felt.

He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant

stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and

ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the

mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his

four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in

his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially,

Quidditch, the most popular sport in the Wizarding world (six tall

goalposts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).

All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line

Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under

the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the

Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because

he hadn’t practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went

back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were

what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins),

and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a

matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s owl,

Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in

the Wizarding world.

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large

and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse- faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other

hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair
Page 11 of 338
Page 12 of 338

that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a

thin, lightning-shaped scar.

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a

wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the

reason he had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.

At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from

the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most

witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in

Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and

somehow — nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been

destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.

So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her

husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding

why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the

Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his

parents.

And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the

whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school,

where he and his scar were famous . . . but now the school year was over,

and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated

like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.

The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be

Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d

never given him a real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it

completely . . .

At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,

“Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.”

Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.

“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,” said

Uncle Vernon.
Page 12 of 338
Page 13 of 338

Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle

Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He’d been talking of

nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to

dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle

Vernon’s company made drills).

“I think we should run through the schedule one more time,” said Uncle

Vernon. “We should all be in position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be

— ?”

“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting to welcome them

graciously to our home.”

“Good, good. And Dudley?”

“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a foul, simpering

smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”

“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.

“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry.

“And you?”

“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,”

said Harry tonelessly.

“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them into the lounge,

introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen —”

“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia.

“And, Dudley, you’ll say —”

“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said Dudley,

offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.

“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.

“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,”

said Harry dully.
Page 13 of 338
Page 14 of 338

“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at

dinner. Petunia, any ideas?”

“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason. . . . Do tell me

where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason. . . .”

“Perfect . . . Dudley?”

“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr.

Mason, and I wrote about you.’”

This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst

into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they

wouldn’t see him laughing.

“And you, boy?”

Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” he

said.

“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “The Masons don’t

know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way. When dinner’s

over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I’ll

bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I’ll have the deal signed

and sealed before the news at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home

in Majorca this time tomorrow.”

Harry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t think the Dursleys

would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.

“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and

me. And you,” he snarled at Harry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while

she’s cleaning.”

Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He

crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his

breath:

“Happy birthday to me . . . happy birthday to me . . .”
Page 14 of 338
Page 15 of 338

No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending

not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so

lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing

Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione

Granger. They, however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of

them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was

going to ask Harry to come and stay.

Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s

cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it

wasn’t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use magic

outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only

their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them

from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and

broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed

muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing

out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence

from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical

world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now Ron and

Hermione had forgotten his birthday.

What wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any

witch or wizard? He’d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco

Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. . . .

Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of

last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord

Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he

was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry

had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it had

been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the

night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now,

remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes —
Page 15 of 338
Page 16 of 338

Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been

staring absent-mindedly into the hedge — and the hedge was staring back.

Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.

Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.

“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward him.

The huge eyes blinked and vanished.

“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had

been.

“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.

“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the days of the

week.”

“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come you haven’t got

any cards? Haven’t you even got friends at that freak place?”

“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,” said Harry

coolly.

Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat

bottom.

“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said suspiciously.

“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,” said

Harry.

Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.

“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic — he said he’ll

chuck you out of the house — and you haven’t got anywhere else to go —

you haven’t got any friends to take you —”

“Jiggery pokery!” said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus pocus —

squiggly wiggly —”

“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed

back toward the house. “MUUUUM! He’s doing you know what!”
Page 16 of 338
Page 17 of 338

Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the

hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn’t really done

magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with

the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he

wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.

While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry

cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flower

beds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The

sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he

shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing

Harry had been thinking himself . . . maybe he didn’t have any friends at

Hogwarts. . . .

Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he

spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down

his face.

It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard

Aunt Petunia calling him.

“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!”

Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of

the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and

sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.

“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia,

pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table.

She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.

Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment

he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!”

As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of

Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just

reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon’s

furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.
Page 17 of 338
Page 18 of 338

“Remember, boy — one sound —”

Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door,

and turned to collapse on his bed.

The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.

CHAPTER TWO

DOBBY’S WARNING

arry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little

creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes

the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been

watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.

As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.

“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”

The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its

long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what

looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.

“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously.

“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure

would carry down the stairs. “So long has Dobby wanted to meet you,

sir . . . Such an honor it is. . . .”
Page 19 of 338
Page 20 of 338

“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his

desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to

ask, “What are you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he

said, “Who are you?”

“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said the creature.

“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be rude or anything,

but — this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.”

Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf

hung his head.

“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry quickly, “but, er, is

there any particular reason you’re here?”

“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come to tell you,

sir . . . it is difficult, sir . . . Dobby wonders where to begin. . . .”

“Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.

To his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy tears.

“S-sit down!” he wailed. “Never . . . never ever . . .”

Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you or anything —”

“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never been asked to sit

down by a wizard — like an equal —”

Harry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the same time,

ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a

large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat

with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration.

“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said Harry, trying to cheer

him up.

Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started

banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad

Dobby!”
Page 20 of 338
Page 21 of 338

“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed, springing up and pulling

Dobby back onto the bed — Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud

screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.

“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly

cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”

“Your family?”

“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf —

bound to serve one house and one family forever. . . .”

“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.

Dobby shuddered.

“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously

for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven

door for this. If they ever knew, sir —”

“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”

“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for

something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they

reminds me to do extra punishments. . . .”

“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”

“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby

free . . . Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir. . . .”

Harry stared.

“And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,” he

said. “This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can’t anyone help

you? Can’t I?”

Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken. Dobby dissolved again

into wails of gratitude.

“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet. If the Dursleys

hear anything, if they know you’re here —”
Page 21 of 338
Page 22 of 338

“Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has heard of your

greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew. . . .”

Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, “Whatever

you’ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I’m not even top of

my year at Hogwarts; that’s Hermione, she —”

But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.

“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby reverently, his orb- like eyes aglow. “Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named —”

“Voldemort?” said Harry.

Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, “Ah, speak not

the name, sir! Speak not the name!”

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My

friend Ron —”

He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.

Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.

“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark

Lord for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped yet

again.”

Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.

“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby

pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has

braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry

Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door

later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.”

There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from

downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.

“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on

September first. It’s all that’s keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s
Page 22 of 338
Page 23 of 338

like here. I don’t belong here. I belong in your world — at Hogwarts.”

“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears

flapped. “Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too

good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal

danger.”

“Why?” said Harry in surprise.

“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things

happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,”

whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. “Dobby has known it for

months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too

important, sir!”

“What terrible things?” said Harry at once. “Who’s plotting them?”

Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically

against the wall.

“All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop him. “You can’t

tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant

thought struck him. “Hang on — this hasn’t got anything to do with Vol-

— sorry — with You-Know-Who, has it? You could just shake or nod,” he

added hastily as Dobby’s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again.

Slowly, Dobby shook his head.

“Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir —”

But Dobby’s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a

hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.

“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?”

Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.

“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a chance of making

horrible things happen at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s

Dumbledore, for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?”

Dobby bowed his head.
Page 23 of 338
Page 24 of 338

“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.

Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir” —

Dobby’s voice dropped to an urgent whisper — “there are powers

Dumbledore doesn’t . . . powers no decent wizard . . .”

And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized

Harry’s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with

earsplitting yelps.

A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart

thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, “Dudley

must have left his television on again, the little tyke!”

“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the

door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.

“What — the — devil — are — you — doing?” said Uncle Vernon

through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry’s. “You’ve just

ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. . . . One more sound and

you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!”

He stomped flat-footed from the room.

Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.

“See what it’s like here?” he said. “See why I’ve got to go back to

Hogwarts? It’s the only place I’ve got — well, I think I’ve got friends.”

“Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?” said Dobby slyly.

“I expect they’ve just been — wait a minute,” said Harry, frowning.

“How do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?”

Dobby shuffled his feet.

“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best

—”

“Have you been stopping my letters?”

HARRY POTTER
AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN
BY
J.K. ROWLING
CHAPTER ONE
OWL POST
Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer
holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but
was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over
his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by
Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill
down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, ‘Witch
Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.’
The quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the
bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read:
Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval
times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard,
burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm
and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the
Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in
various disguises.
Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his inkbottle and a
roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and
began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the
scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find himself locked in the
cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.
The Dursley family of Number Four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his
summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were Harry’s only living
relatives. They were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry’s dead
parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys’
roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden
as possible, they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had not been
unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the
last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however,
was to lock away Harry’s spell books, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of the summer
break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.
This separation from his spell books had been a real problem for Harry, because his teachers at
Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about
shrinking potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to
have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the
first week of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the
front garden to admire Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the
street would notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the
stairs, grabbed some of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn’t leave spots
of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night.
Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment, as they
were already in an especially bad mood with him, all because he’d received a telephone call from a
fellow wizard one week into the school vacation.
Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of
wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn’t, but had never used a telephone
before. Most unluckily, it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.
“Vernon Dursley speaking.”
Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard Ron’s voice answer.
“HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT — TO — TALK — TO — HARRY
— POTTER!”
Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his
ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm.
“WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. “WHO ARE YOU?”
“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were speaking from
opposite ends of a football field. “I’M — A — FRIEND — OF — HARRY’S — FROM —
SCHOOL —”
Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the spot.
“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared, now holding the receiver at arm’s
length, as though frightened it might explode. “I DON’T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU’RE
TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON’T YOU COME NEAR MY
FAMILY!”
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider.
The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE — PEOPLE LIKE YOU!”
Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, because he hadn’t called again.
Harry’s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry
suspected that Ron had warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the
cleverest witch in Harry’s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and
would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks, and this
summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There was just one very small
improvement — after swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry
had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the
racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time.
Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen again. The silence in the
dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must
be very late, Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he’d finish this essay
tomorrow night…
He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed; put the
flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under
a loose floorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the time on the
luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.
It was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years
old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.
Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays. He
had never received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two
birthdays, and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one.
Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s large, empty cage, to the open window. He
leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig
had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried about her: she’d been gone this long
before. But he hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living creature in this house who didn’t
flinch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few inches over the last year.
His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to
it. The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair,
was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as
the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents,
because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered, murdered by
the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same
attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing
him, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had fled…
But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he
stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth
birthday.
He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse
dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds
before Harry realized what he was seeing.
Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment, was a large, strangely
lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry’s direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink
lower and lower. For a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering whether
to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and
Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside.
Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third, which appeared to be
unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on Harry’s bed, and the middle owl, which was large
and gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name was Errol, and he belonged to the
Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel,
and then carried Errol to Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks,
and began to gulp some water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy female, was his own
Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry
an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.
Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew at once where it had
come from, because in addition to a third package, it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts
crest. When Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its
wings, and took off through the window into the night.
Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s package, ripped off the brown paper, and
discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he
opened the envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a newspaper clipping.
The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the
people in the black-and-white picture were moving. Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out,
and read:
MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE
Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the
annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.
A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, “We will be spending the gold on a summer holiday
in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.”
The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year
at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend.
Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the
Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley;
tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white picture didn’t
show it) with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with
his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.
Harry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the Weasleys,
who were very nice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron’s letter and unfolded it.
Dear Harry,
Happy birthday!
Look, I’m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles didn’t give you a hard time. I
asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn’t have shouted.
It’s amazing here in Egypt. Bill’s taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn’t believe the curses
those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn’t let Ginny come in the last one. There were all
these mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who’d broken in and grown extra heads and stuff.
I couldn’t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it’s
gone on this trip, but they’re going to buy me a new wand for next year.
Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron’s old wand had snapped. It had
happened when the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the
school grounds.
We’ll be back about a week before term starts and we’ll be going up to London to get my wand and
our new books. Any chance of meeting you there?
Don’t let the Muggles get you down!
Try and come to London,
Ron
P.S. Percy’s Head Boy. He got the letter last week.
Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts,
was looking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top
of his neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.
Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked like a miniature glass
spinning top. There was another note from Ron beneath it.
Harry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s someone untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light
up and spin. Bill says it’s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at
dinner last night. But he didn’t realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup.
Bye — Ron
Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its
point, reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then
picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought.
Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, this time from Hermione.
Dear Harry,
Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you’re all right.
I’m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn’t know how I was going to send this to you —
what if they’d opened it at customs? — but then Hedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you
got something for your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there was an
advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I’ve been getting it delivered; it’s so good to keep up with what’s going
on in the wizarding world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet he’s learning
loads. I’m really jealous — the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating.
There’s some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic
essay to include some of the things I’ve found out, I hope it’s not too long — it’s two rolls of parchment
more than Professor Binns asked for.
Ron says he’s going to be in London in the last week of the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt
and uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I’ll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September
first!
Love from Hermione
P.S. Ron says Percy’s Head Boy. I’ll bet Percy’s really pleased. Ron doesn’t seem too happy about it.
Harry laughed as he put Hermione’s letter aside and picked up her present. It was very heavy.
Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells — but it wasn’t.
His heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with
silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit.
“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-
Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-
It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the
most popular sport in the magical world — highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on
broomsticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person
in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl
on the brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top
layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it properly,
the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose, but
then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to
befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon
eggs into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached for the lamp on his
bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he
seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.
And out fell — a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome green cover, emblazoned
with the golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled
sideways along the bed like some weird crab.
“Uh-oh,” Harry muttered.
The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry
followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space under his desk. Praying that the
Dursleys were still fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it.
“Ouch!”
The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still scuttling on its covers.
Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward, and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a
loud, sleepy grunt in the room next door.
Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms,
hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The
Monster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it down on the
bed and reached for Hagrid’s card.
Dear Harry,
Happy Birthday!
Think you might find this useful for next year. Won’t say no more here. Tell you when I see you.
Hope the Muggles are treating you right.
All the best,
Hagrid
It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful, but he put
Hagrid’s card up next to Ron’s and Hermione’s, grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was
only the letter from Hogwarts left.
Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the envelope, pulled out the first
page of parchment within, and read:
Dear Mr. Potter,
Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave
from King’s Cross station, platform nine and three-quarters, at eleven o’clock.
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the
enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign.
A list of books for next year is enclosed.
Yours sincerely,
Professor M. McGonagall
Deputy Headmistress
Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no longer grinning. It would
be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he
had never set foot there. But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia
to sign the form?
He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o’clock in the morning.
Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, Harry got back into bed
and reached up to cross off another day on the chart he’d made for himself, counting down the days
left until his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down; eyes open, facing his
three birthday cards.
Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just like everyone else —
glad, for the first time in his life, that it was his birthday.
CHAPTER TWO
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around
the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer
present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and
the television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy
little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually.
Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and
a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign
that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped
himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway
through a report on an escaped convict.
“…the public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been
set up, and any sighting of Black should be reported immediately.”
“No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at
the prisoner. “Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout! Look at his hair!”
He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great
annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face
was surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.
The reporter had reappeared.
“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today —”
“Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. “You didn’t tell us where
that maniac’s escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!”
Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the
kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line
number. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring,
law-abiding neighbors.
“When will they learn,” said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, “that
hanging’s the only way to deal with these people?”
“Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door’s runner-beans.
Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, “I’d better be off in a minute,
Petunia. Marge’s train gets in at ten.”
Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back
to earth with an unpleasant bump.
“Aunt Marge?” he blurted out. “Sh-she’s not coming here, is she?”
Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry’s
(whose mother had been Aunt Petunia’s sister), he had been forced to call her ‘Aunt’ all his life. Aunt
Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn’t often
stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood
out horribly vividly in Harry’s mind.
At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around the shins with her
walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned
up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her
last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her
favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had
refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of
laughter to Dudley’s eyes.
“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “and while we’re on the subject,” he
pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry, “we need to get a few things straight before I go and
collect her.”
Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry being bullied by
Uncle Vernon was Dudley’s favorite form of entertainment.
“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you’re talking to
Marge.”
“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s talking to me.”
“Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge
doesn’t know anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any — any funny stuff while she’s here.
You behave yourself, got me?”
“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth.
“And thirdly,” said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, “we’ve
told Marge you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.”
“What?” Harry yelled.
“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be trouble,” spat Uncle Vernon.
Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt
Marge coming for a weeklong visit — it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given
him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks.
“Well, Petunia,” said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, “I’ll be off to the station, then.
Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?”
“No,” said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had
finished threatening Harry.
“Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,” said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley’s
thick blond hair. “Mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow-tie.”
Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder.
“See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the kitchen.
Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his
toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door.
Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.
“I’m not taking you,” he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.
“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly. “I want to ask you something.”
Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.
“Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,” said Harry.
“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door.
“I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry in a rush.
“And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon.
“Well,” said Harry, choosing his words carefully, “it’ll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I
go to that St. Whatsits…”
“St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry
was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon’s large, purple face. “It’s a lot to
remember. I’ll have to make it sound convincing, won’t I? What if I accidentally let something slip?”
“You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?” roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry
with his fist raised. But Harry stood his ground.
“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,” he said
grimly.
Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.
“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m
supposed to go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal and everything.”
Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein
was throbbing in his temple.
“Right,” he snapped finally. “I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge’s visit. If, at
the end of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll sign your ruddy form.”
He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little
panes of glass at the top fell out.
Harry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act
like a real Muggle, heed better start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his
birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to
Hedwig’s cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their
wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.
“Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’re going to have to clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron’ll
look after you. I’ll write him a note, explaining. And don’t look at me like that” — Hedwig’s large
amber eyes were reproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll be allowed to visit
Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.”
Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of
the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away
inside the wardrobe.
But Harry didn’t have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the
stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest.
“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the hall.
Harry couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him,
so the untidier he looked, the happier she would be.
All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon’s car pulled back into the
driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path.
“Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.
A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.
On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-
faced, she even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous
suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.
“Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s my neffy poo?”
Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just
visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry’s stomach, knocking the
wind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.
Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge’s hugs because he was well
paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched
in his fat fist.
“Petunia!” shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a hat-stand. Aunt Marge
and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunias bony
cheekbone.
Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.
“Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?”
“Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the
kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But Harry wasn’t complaining; any excuse
not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare
bedroom, taking as long as he could.
By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake,
and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea
and drool flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.
“Who’s looking after the other dogs, Marge?” Uncle Vernon asked.
“Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,” boomed Aunt Marge. “He’s retired now, good
for him to have something to do. But I couldn’t leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he’s away from
me.”
Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt Marge’s attention to Harry
for the first time.
“So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt Marge growled. “It’s damn good of Vernon
and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn’t have done it myself. You’d have gone straight to an orphanage if
you’d been dumped on my doorstep.”
Harry was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the
thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face into a painful smile.
“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. “I can see you haven’t improved since I last saw
you. I hoped school would knock some manners into you.” She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her
mustache, and said, “Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?”
“St. Brutus’s,” said Uncle Vernon promptly. “It’s a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.”
“I see,” said Aunt Marge. “Do they use the cane at St. Brutus’s, boy?” she barked across the table.
“Er —”
Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s back.
“Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, he added, “All the time.”
“Excellent,” said Aunt Marge. “I won’t have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about
not hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is what’s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred. Have you been beaten often?”
“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, “loads of times.”
Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.
“I still don’t like your tone, boy,” she said. “If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way,
they clearly aren’t hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I’d write if I were you. Make it clear that you
approve the use of extreme force in this boy’s case.”
Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain; in any case, he
changed the subject abruptly.
“Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, eh?”
As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself thinking almost longingly
of life at number four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to
stay out of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other hand,
wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom out suggestions for his
improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying
Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn’t got a
present too. She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory
person.
“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, Vernon,” she said over lunch on
the third day. “If there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.”
Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn
with anger. Remember the form, he told himself. Think about Hogsmeade. Don’t say anything. Don’t
rise —
Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.
“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You see it all the time with dogs. If there’s
something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong with the pup —”
At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her hand. Shards of glass
flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.
“Marge!” squealed Aunt Petunia. “Marge, are you all right?”
“Not to worry,” grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin. “Must have squeezed
it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster’s the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a
very firm grip…”
But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided
he’d better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could.
Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply. It had been a long time since
he’d lost control and made something explode. He couldn’t afford to let it happen again. The
Hogsmeade form wasn’t the only thing at stake — if he carried on like that, he’d be in trouble with
the Ministry of Magic.
Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside
school. His record wasn’t exactly clean either. Only last summer he’d gotten an official warning that
had stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry
would face expulsion from Hogwarts.
He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way.
Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his Handbook of Do-It-
Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him. This worked quite well, though it seemed
to give him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally
subnormal.
At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge’s stay arrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner
and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the
salmon without a single mention of Harry’s faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon
bored them a with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making company; then Aunt Petunia made
coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.
“Can I tempt you, Marge?”
Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very red.
“Just a small one, then,” she chuckled. “A bit more than that…and a bit more…that’s the
ticket.”
Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger
sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon’s angry
little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out.
“Aah,” said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down.
“Excellent nosh, Petunia. It’s normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look
after…” She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. “Pardon me. But I do like to see a
healthy-sized boy,” she went on, winking at Dudley. “You’ll be a proper-sized man, Dudders, like
your father. Yes, I’ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon…”
“Now, this one here —”
She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly.
“This one’s got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster
drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.”
Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers.
“It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day. Bad blood will out. Now, I’m saying
nothing against your family, Petunia” — she patted Aunt Petunia’s bony hand with her shovel-like
one “but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then she ran off with a wastrel
and here’s the result right in front of us.”
Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he
thought. But he couldn’t remember what came next. Aunt Marge’s voice seemed to be boring into
him like one of Uncle Vernon’s drills.
“This Potter,” said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her
glass and over the tablecloth, “you never told me what he did?”
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from
his pie to gape at his parents.
“He — didn’t work,” said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. “Unemployed.”
“As I expected!” said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her
sleeve. “A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who —”
“He was not,” said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He
had never felt so angry in his life.
“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied the bottle
into Aunt Marge’s glass. “You, boy,” he snarled at Harry. “Go to bed, go on —”
“No, Vernon,” hiccupped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on
Harry’s. “Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go and get themselves killed in a
car crash (drunk, I expect) —”
“They didn’t die in a car crash!” said Harry, who found himself on his feet.
“They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent,
hardworking relatives!” screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. “You are an insolent, ungrateful
little —”
But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had
failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger — but the swelling didn’t stop. Her
great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech
— next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls — she
was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her
fingers blowing up like a salami…
“MARGE!” yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge’s whole body began
to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy
eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic
popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly.
“NOOOOOOO!”
Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge’s feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted
from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon’s
leg.
Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under
the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his
trunk to the front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the
loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. He wriggled
out, seized Hedwig’s empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon
burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.
“COME BACK IN HERE!” he bellowed. “COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!”
But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and
pointed it at Uncle Vernon.
“She deserved it,” Harry said, breathing very fast. “She deserved what she got. You keep away
from me.”
He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.
“I’m going,” Harry said. “I’ve had enough.”
And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind
him, Hedwig’s cage under his arm.
CHAPTER THREE
THE KNIGHT BUS
Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting
from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to
the frantic thumping of his heart.
But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever
way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark
Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done serious
magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had broken the
Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic
representatives weren’t swooping down on him where he sat.
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.
What, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from
the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was
sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both
abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.
He didn’t have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the
bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at
Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He’d never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London.
Unless…
He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled
(his heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn’t hurt. He had the Invisibility
Cloak he had inherited from his father — what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light,
tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? Then he could get the
rest of his money out of his vault and…begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he
couldn’t sit on this wall forever, or he’d find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was
out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick.
Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak
— but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more.
A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the
street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.
He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on
his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap
between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would
move, then he’d know whether it was just a stray cat or — something else.
“Lumos,” Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He
held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage
door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very
big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as
he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter.
There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden
blinding light…
With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of
wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as
Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out
of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus.
For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in
a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night.
“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out
your wand hand, step on board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan
Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve—”
The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the
ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan
Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large,
protruding ears and quite a few pimples.
“What were you doin’ down there?” said Stan, dropping his professional manner.
“Fell over,” said Harry.
“’Choo fall over for?” sniggered Stan.
“I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the
hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen
over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The Knight
Bus’s headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty.
“‘Choo lookin’ at?” said Stan.
“There was a big black thing,” said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap. “Like a dog…but
massive…”
He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw
Stan’s eyes move to the scar on Harry’s forehead.
“Woss that on your ’ead?” said Stan abruptly.
“Nothing,” said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was
looking for him, he didn’t want to make it too easy for them.
“Woss your name?” Stan persisted.
“Neville Longbottom,” said Harry, saying the first name that came into his head. “So — so this
bus,” he went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, “did you say it goes anywhere?”
“Yep,” said Stan proudly, “anywhere you like, ’long it’s on land. Can’t do nuffink underwater.
“Ere,” he said, looking suspicious again, “you did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand
’and, dincha?”
“Yes,” said Harry quickly. “Listen, how much would it be to get to London?”
“Eleven Sickles,” said Stan, “but for firteen you get ’ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an ’ot-
water bottle an’ a toofbrush in the color of your choice.”
Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and shoved some gold into
Stan’s hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig’s cage balanced on top, up the steps of
the bus.
There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows.
Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny
wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, “Not now, thanks, I’m pickling some slugs” and
rolled over in his sleep.
“You ’ave this one,” Stan whispered, shoving Harry’s trunk under the bed right behind the
driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. “This is our driver, Ernie Prang.
This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.”
Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously
flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.
“Take’er away, Ern,” said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie’s.
There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found himself flat on his
bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the
dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was
watching Harry’s stunned face with great enjoyment.
“This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he said. “Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in
Wales?”
“Ar,” said Ernie.
“How come the Muggles don’t hear the bus?” said Harry.
“Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don’ listen properly, do they? Don’ look properly either.
Never notice nuffink, they don’.”
“Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,” said Ern. “We’ll be in Abergavenny in a minute.”
Stan passed Harry’s bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking
out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn’t seem to have mastered the use of a
steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn’t hit anything; lines of
lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position
once it had passed.
Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak.
“’Ere you go, Madam Marsh,” said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a
foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and
tottered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was
another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the
way.
Harry wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didn’t keep
banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back to
wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt
Marge off the ceiling yet.
Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his
teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry
from the front page. He looked strangely familiar.
“That man!” Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. “He was on the Muggle news!”
Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.
“Sirius Black,” he said, nodding. “’Course ’e was on the Muggle news, Neville. Where you
been?”
He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry’s face, removed the front page, and
handed it to Harry.
“You oughta read the papers more, Neville.”
Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:
BLACK STILL AT LARGE
Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding
capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.
“We are doing all we can to recapture Black,” said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this
morning, “and we beg the magical community to remain calm.”
Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing
the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.
“Well, really, I had to, don’t you know,” said an irritable Fudge. “Black is mad. He’s a danger to
anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a
word of Black’s true identity to anyone. And let’s face it — who’d believe him if he did?”
While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to
kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when
Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse.
Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that
seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense
Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.
“Scary-lookin’ fing, inee?” said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.
“He murdered thirteen people?” said Harry, handing the page back to Stan, “with one curse?”
“Yep,” said Stan, “in front of witnesses an’ all. Broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit,
Ern?”
“Ar,” said Ern darkly.
Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look at Harry.
“Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-’Oo,” he said.
“What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking.
Even Stan’s pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse
had to jump aside to avoid the bus.
“You outta your tree?” yelped Stan. “’Choo say ’is name for?”
“Sorry,” said Harry hastily. “Sorry, I — I forgot —”
“Forgot!” said Stan weakly. “Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’ that fast…”
“So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?” Harry prompted apologetically.
“Yeah,” said Stan, still rubbing his chest. “Yeah, that’s right. Very close to You-Know-’Oo, they
say…anyway, when little ‘Arry Potter got the better of You-Know-’Oo” — Harry nervously
flattened his bangs down again — “all You-Know-’Oo’s supporters was tracked down, wasn’t they,
Ern? Most of ‘em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-’Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not
Sirius Black. I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in-command once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over.
“Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles an’ Black took out ‘is
wand and ‘e blasted ‘alf the street apart, an’ a wizard got it, an’ so did a dozen Muggles what got in
the way. ‘Orrible, eh? An’ you know what Black did then?” Stan continued in a dramatic whisper.
“What?” said Harry.
“Laughed,” said Stan. “Jus’ stood there an’ laughed. An’ when reinforcements from the Ministry
of Magic got there, ‘e went wiv em quiet as anyfink, still laughing ‘is ‘ead off. ‘Cos ‘e’s mad, inee,
Ern? Inee mad?”
“If he weren’t when he went to Azkaban, he will be now,” said Ern in his slow voice. “I’d blow
meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind you…after what he did…”
“They ‘ad a job coverin’ it up, din’ they, Ern?” Stan said. “’Ole street blown up an’ all them
Muggles dead. What was it they said ‘ad ‘appened, Ern?”
“Gas explosion,” grunted Ernie.
“An’ now ‘e’s out,” said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of Black’s gaunt face again.
“Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, ‘as there, Ern? Beats me ‘ow ‘e did it. Frightenin’, eh?
Mind, I don’t fancy ‘is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?”
Ernie suddenly shivered. “Talk about summat else, Stan, there’s a good lad. Them Azkaban
guards give me the collywobbles.”
Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus,
feeling worse than ever. He couldn’t help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a
few nights’ time.
“‘Ear about that ‘Arry Potter? Blew up ‘is aunt! We ‘ad ‘im ‘ere on the Knight Bus, di’n’t we,
Ern? ‘E was tryin’ to run for it…”
He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough
to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn’t know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he’d
ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent
two months there only last year. Harry wouldn’t soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid’s face
when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.
The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone
booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan
remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry’s pillow when the
bus moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns
and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.
Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.
“Right then, Neville,” said Stan, clapping his hands, “whereabouts in London?”
“Diagon Alley,” said Harry.
“Righto,” said Stan. “’Old tight, then.”
BANG.
They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and
benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus’s way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He
would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it opened, then set off — where, he
didn’t know.
Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby-
looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.
“Thanks,” Harry said to Ern.
He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig’s cage onto the
pavement.
“Well,” said Harry. “Bye then!”
But Stan wasn’t paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the
shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.
“There you are, Harry,” said a voice.
Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted,
“Blimey! Ern, come ‘ere! Come ‘ere!”
Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into
his stomach — he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.
Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.
“What didja call Neville, Minister?” he said excitedly.
Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.
“Neville?” he repeated, frowning. “This is Harry Potter.”
“I knew it!” Stan shouted gleefully. “Ern! Ern! Guess ‘oo Neville is, Ern! ‘E’s ‘Arry Potter! I can
see ‘is scar!”
“Yes,” said Fudge testily, “well, I’m very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need
to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now…”
Fudge increased the pressure on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside
the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom,
the wizened, toothless landlord.
“You’ve got him, Minister!” said Tom. “Will you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?”
“Perhaps a pot of tea,” said Fudge, who still hadn’t let go of Harry.
There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying
Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage and looking around excitedly.
“’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ‘oo you are, eh, Neville?” said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie’s
owlish face peered interestedly over Stan’s shoulder.
“And a private parlor, please, Tom,” said Fudge pointedly.
“Bye,” Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that
led from the bar.
“Bye, Neville!” called Stan.
Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom’s lantern, and then into a small
parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the
room.
“Sit down, Harry,” said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.
Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took
off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and
sat down opposite Harry.
“I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.”
Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing
his father’s Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn’t to know that.
Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea
and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing
the door behind him.
“Well, Harry,” said Fudge, pouring out tea, “you’ve had us all in a right flap, I don’t mind
telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle’s house like that! I’d started to think…but
you’re safe, and that’s what matters.”
Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.
“Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then…You will be pleased to hear that we have
dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental
Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been
punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So
that’s that, and no harm done.”
Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite
nephew. Harry, who couldn’t believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn’t think of
anything to say, and closed it again.
“Ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?” said Fudge. “Well, I won’t
deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as
long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.”
Harry unstuck his throat.
“I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,” he said, “and I don’t ever
want to go back to Privet Drive.”
“Now, now, I’m sure you’ll feel differently once you’ve calmed down,” said Fudge in a worried
tone. “They are your family, after all, and I’m sure you are fond of each other — er — very deep
down.”
It didn’t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear what was going to
happen to him now.
“So all that remains,” said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, “is to decide where
you’re going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the
Leaky Cauldron and…”
“Hang on,” blurted Harry. “What about my punishment?”
Fudge blinked. “Punishment?”
“I broke the law!” Harry said. “The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!”
“Oh, my dear boy, we’re not going to punish you for a little thing like that!” cried Fudge, waving
his crumpet impatiently. “It was an accident! We don’t send people to Azkaban just for blowing up
their aunts!”
But this didn’t tally at all with Harry’s past dealings with the Ministry of Magic.
“Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle’s
house!” he told Fudge, frowning. “The Ministry of Magic said I’d be expelled from Hogwarts if
there was any more magic there!”
Unless Harry’s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking awkward.
“Circumstances change, Harry…We have to take into account…in the present climate…Surely
you don’t want to be expelled?”
“Of course I don’t,” said Harry.
“Well then, what’s all the fuss about?” laughed Fudge. “Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go
and see if Tom’s got a room for you.”
Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was something extremely odd
going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for
what he’d done? And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn’t usual for the Minister of Magic
himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?
Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.
“Room eleven’s free, Harry,” said Fudge. “I think you’ll be very comfortable just one thing, and
I’m sure you’ll understand…I don’t want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to
Diagon Alley. And you’re to be back here before dark each night. Sure you’ll understand. Tom will
be keeping an eye on you for me.”
“Okay,” said Harry slowly, “but why?”
“Don’t want to lose you again, do we?” said Fudge with a hearty laugh. “No, no…best we know
where you are…I mean…”
Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.
“Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know…”
“Have you had any luck with Black yet?” Harry asked.
Fudge’s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.
“What’s that? Oh, you’ve heard - well, no, not yet, but it’s only a matter of time. The Azkaban
guards have never yet failed…and they are angrier than I’ve ever seen them.”
Fudge shuddered slightly.
“So, I’ll say good-bye.”
He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.
“Er — Minister? Can I ask you something?”
“Certainly,” said Fudge with a smile.
“Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn’t
sign the permission form. D’you think you could —?”
Fudge was looking uncomfortable.
“Ah,” he said. “No, no, I’m very sorry, Harry, but as I’m not your parent or guardian —”
“But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said Harry eagerly. “If you gave me permission…”
“No, I’m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,” said Fudge flatly.
“Perhaps you’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it’s best if you
don’t…yes…well, I’ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.”
And with a last smile and shake of Harry’s hand, Fudge left the room. Tom now moved forward,
beaming at Harry.
“If you’ll follow me, Mr. Potter,” he said, “I’ve already taken your things up…”
Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on
it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him.
Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully
crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe —
“Hedwig!” Harry gasped.
The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry’s arm.
“Very smart owl you’ve got there,” chuckled Tom. “Arrived about five minutes after you did. If
there’s anything you need, Mr. Potter, don’t hesitate to ask.”
He gave another bow and left.
Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig. The sky outside the
window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink
shot with gold. Harry could hardly believe that he’d left Privet Drive only a few hours ago, that he
wasn’t expelled, and that he was now facing three completely Dursley-free weeks.
“It’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,” he yawned.
And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep.
CHAPTER FOUR
THE LEAKY CAULDRON
It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never before had he been able
to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as
long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating
wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into the
Muggle world.
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked watching the other
guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s shopping; venerable-looking wizards
arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and
once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick
woolen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand, tap the third brick
from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the
wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored
umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases (“It’s a
lunascope, old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case
of Sirius Black (“Personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone until he’s back in Azkaban”).
Harry didn’t have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in
the bright sunshine outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his essays with
occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about
medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free sundaes every half an hour.
Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts
from his vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once.
He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to
ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold
Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid
into the other player’s face when they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect,
moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to take
another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry’s resolution most appeared in his favorite
shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he’d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.
Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged his way inside and
squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on
which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.
“Just come out — prototype —” a square-jawed wizard was telling his companion.
“It’s the fastest broom in the world, isn’t it, Dad?” squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was
swinging off his father’s arm.
“Irish International Side’s just put in an order for seven of these beauties!” the proprietor of the
shop told the crowd. “And they’re favorites for the World Cup!”
A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign next to the broom:
** THE FIREBOLT **
THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART RACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED, SUPERFINE
HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH AND HAND-NUMBERED
WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH
TWIG IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION,
GIVING THE FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE
FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND
INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.
Price on request…Harry didn’t like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had
never wanted anything as much in his whole life — but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his
Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt,
when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn’t ask for the price, but he returned, almost
every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.
There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish
his store of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm
and leg, he visited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most important
of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care
of Magical Creatures and Divination.
Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of the usual display of
gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that
held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying everywhere
as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping
aggressively.
Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book
of Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood
why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether
Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.
As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward him.
“Hogwarts?” he said abruptly. “Come to get your new books?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “I need —”
“Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of
very thick gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the
Monster Books’ cage.
“Hang on,” said Harry quickly, “I’ve already got one of those.”
“Have you?” A look of enormous relief spread over the manager’s face. “Thank heavens for that.
I’ve been bitten five times already this morning —”
A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had seized a third and were pulling
it apart.
“Stop it! Stop it!” cried the manager, poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the
books apart. “I’m never stocking them again, never! It’s been bedlam! I thought we’d seen the worst
when we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility — cost a fortune, and we
never found them…Well…is there anything else I can help you with?”
“Yes,” said Harry, looking down his booklist, “I need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra
Vablatsky.”
“Ah, starting Divination, are you?” said the manager, stripping off his gloves and leading Harry
into the back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was
stacked with volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against Shocks and Broken
Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.
“Here you are,” said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick, black-
bound book. “Unfogging the Future. Very good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods —
palmistry, crystal balls, bird entrails.”
But Harry wasn’t listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which was among a display on
a small table: Death Omens — What to Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming.
“Oh, I wouldn’t read that if I were you,” said the manager lightly, looking to see what Harry was
staring at. “You’ll start seeing death omens everywhere. It’s enough to frighten anyone to death.”
But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a black dog large as a bear,
with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar…
The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry’s hands.
“Anything else?” he said.
“Yes,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog’s and dazedly consulting his booklist. “Er
— I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.”
Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms
and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where he was going and bumping
into several people.
He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books onto his bed. Somebody
had been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses
rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in
Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin.
“It can’t have been a death omen,” he told his reflection defiantly. “I was panicking when I saw
that thing in Magnolia Crescent…It was probably just a stray dog…”
He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat
“You’re fighting a losing battle there, dear,” said his mirror in a wheezy voice.
As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione.
Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near.
Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch
Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a
round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn’t stop to chat; Neville appeared
to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking grandmother.
Harry hoped she never found out that he’d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the
Ministry of Magic.
Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at least meet Ron and
Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the
Firebolt, and was just wondering where he’d have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he
turned.
“Harry! HARRY!”
They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron
looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.
“Finally!” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. “We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but
they said you’d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin’s, and —”
“I got all my school stuff last week,” Harry explained. “And how come you knew I’m staying at
the Leaky Cauldron?”
“Dad,” said Ron simply.
Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have heard the whole story
of what had happened to Aunt Marge.
“Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?” said Hermione in a very serious voice.
“I didn’t mean to,” said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. “I just — lost control.”
“It’s not funny, Ron,” said Hermione sharply. “Honestly, I’m amazed Harry wasn’t expelled.”
“So am I,” admitted Harry. “Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested.” He looked at
Ron. “Your dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he?”
“Probably ‘cause it’s you, isn’t it?” shrugged Ron, still chuckling. “Famous Harry Potter and all
that. I’d hate to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig
me up first, because Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening.
We’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King’s Cross with us
tomorrow! Hermione’s there as well!”
Hermione nodded, beaming. “Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my
Hogwarts things.”
“Excellent!” said Harry happily. “So, have you got all your new books and stuff?”
“Look at this,” said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it. “Brand-new wand.
Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And we’ve got all our books —” He
pointed at a large bag under his chair. “What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant nearly
cried when we said we wanted two.”
“What’s all that, Hermione?” Harry asked, pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the
chair next to her.
“Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t I,” said Hermione. “Those are my books
for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies
—”
“What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said Ron, rolling his eyes at Harry. “You’re Muggle-
born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!”
“But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view,” said Hermione
earnestly.
“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?” asked Harry, while Ron sniggered.
Hermione ignored them.
“I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she said, checking her purse. “It’s my birthday in September, and
Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present.”
“How about a nice book? said Ron innocently.
“No, I don’t think so,” said Hermione composedly. “I really want an owl. I mean, Harry’s got
Hedwig and you’ve got Errol —”
“I haven’t,” said Ron. “Errol’s a family owl. All I’ve got is Scabbers.” He pulled his pet rat out of
his pocket. “And I want to get him checked over,” he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front
of them. “I don’t think Egypt agreed with him.”
Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to his whiskers.
“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well
by now. “You could see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.”
So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie.
There wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It was smelly and very
noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The
witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry,
Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.
A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic
tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were
oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat
and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every color, a noisy cage of
ravens, a basket of funny custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a
vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long, bald tails.
The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.
“It’s my rat,” he told the witch. “He’s been a bit off-color ever since I brought him back from
Egypt.”
“Bang him on the counter,” said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her
pocket.
Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats,
who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better took.
Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to
Ron’s brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially
woebegone.
“Hm,” said the witch, picking up Scabbers. “How old is this rat?”
“Dunno,” said Ron. “Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.”
“What powers does he have?” said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.
“Er —” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers.
The witch’s eyes moved from Scabbers’s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing,
and tutted loudly.
“He’s been through the mill, this one,” she said.
“He was like that when Percy gave him to me,” said Ron defensively.
“An ordinary common or garden rat like this can’t be expected to live longer than three years or
so,” said the witch. “Now, if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might
like one of these —”
She indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron muttered, “Show-offs.”
“Well, if you don’t want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,” said the witch, reaching
under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle.
“Okay,” said Ron. “How much — OUCH!”
Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage,
landed on his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers.
“NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!” cried the witch, but Scabbers shot from between her hands like
a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then scampered for the door.
“Scabbers!” Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry followed.
It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin
outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and
straightened up, massaging his head.
“What was that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl.”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it,
Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the
enormous ginger cat.
“You bought that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it
was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run
headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring
contentedly in Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest pocket. “He needs rest
and relaxation! How’s he going to get it with that thing around?”
“That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,” said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into
Ron’s hand. “And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in
yours, what’s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he’d been in there for ages; no one
wanted him.”
“Wonder why,” said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron.
They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily Prophet.
“Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up. “How are you?”
“Fine, thanks,” said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with their shopping.
Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring
up at him.
“They still haven’t caught him, then?” he asked.
“No,” said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. “They’ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at
the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.”
“Would we get a reward if we caught him?” asked Ron. “It’d be good to get some more money
—”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained.
“Black’s not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It’s the Azkaban guards who’ll get him
back, you mark my words.”
At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags and followed by the
twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head
Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys’ youngest child and only girl, Ginny.
Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed
than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at
Hogwarts. She went very red and muttered “hello” without looking at him. Percy, however, held out
his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, “Harry. How nice to see you.”
“Hello, Percy,” said Harry, trying not to laugh.
“I hope you’re well?” said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced
to the mayor.
“Very well, thanks —”
“Harry!” said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. “Simply splendid to see
you, old boy —”
“Marvelous,” said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry’s hand in turn. “Absolutely
spiffing.”
Percy scowled.
“That’s enough, now,” said Mrs. Weasley.
“Mum!” said Fred, as though he’d only just spotted her and seizing her hand, too. “How really
corking to see you —”
“I said, that’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an empty chair. “Hello,
Harry, dear. I suppose you’ve heard our exciting news?” She pointed to the brand-new silver badge
on Percy’s chest. “Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling with pride.
“And last,” Fred muttered under his breath.
“I don’t doubt that,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. “I notice they haven’t made you
two prefects.”
“What do we want to be prefects for?” said George, looking revolted at the very idea. “It’d take
all the fun out of life.”
Ginny giggled.
“You want to set a better example for your sister!” snapped Mrs. Weasley.
“Ginny’s got other brothers to set her an example, Mother,” said Percy loftily. “I’m going up to
change for dinner…”
He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.
“We tried to shut him in a pyramid,” he told Harry. “But Mum spotted us.”
Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the
parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.
“How’re we getting to King’s Cross tomorrow, Dad?” asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous
chocolate pudding.
“The Ministry’s providing a couple of cars,” said Mr. Weasley.
Everyone looked up at him.
“Why?” said Percy curiously.
“It’s because of you, Perce,” said George seriously. “And there’ll be little flags on the hoods, with
HB on them—”
“— for Humongous Bighead,” said Fred.
Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.
“Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?” Percy asked again, in a dignified voice.
“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mr. Weasley, “and as I work there, they’re doing
me a favor…”
His voice was casual, but Harry couldn’t help noticing that Mr. Wesley’s ears had gone red, just
like Ron’s did when he was under pressure.
“Good thing, too,” said Mrs. Weasley briskly. “Do you realize how much luggage you’ve all got
between you? A nice sight you’d be on the Muggle Underground…You are all packed, aren’t you?”
“Ron hasn’t put all his new things in his trunk yet,” said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. “He’s
dumped them on my bed.”
“You’d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won’t have much time in the morning,”
Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.
After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made their way upstairs to their
rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just
closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what
was going on.
The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.
“It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing —”
“I haven’t touched it, all right?” Ron roared back.
“What’s up?” said Harry.
“My Head Boy badge is gone,” said Percy, rounding on Harry.
“So’s Scabbers’s Rat Tonic,” said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk to look. “I think I
might’ve left it in the bar —”
“You’re not going anywhere till you’ve found my badge!” yelled Percy.
“I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed,” Harry said to Ron, and he went downstairs.
Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard
another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and
Mrs. Weasleys’. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he’d heard them arguing, when the sound
of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.
“…makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. “Harry’s got a right to
know. I’ve tried to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a child. He’s thirteen years old
and —”
“Arthur, the truth would terrify him!” said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. “Do you really want to send
Harry back to school with that hanging over him? For heaven’s sake, he’s happy not knowing!”
“I don’t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!” retorted Mr. Weasley.
“You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves — they've even ended up in
the Forbidden Forest! But Harry mustn’t do that this year! When I think what could have happened
to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn’t picked him up, I’m prepared to
bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.”
“But he’s not dead, he’s fine, so what’s the point —”
“Molly, they say Sirius Black’s mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever enough to escape from
Azkaban, and that’s supposed to be impossible. It’s been three weeks, and no one’s seen hide nor hair
of him, and I don’t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we’re no nearer catching Black
than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what Black’s after —”
“But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.”
“We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of Azkaban, he can break into
Hogwarts.”
“But no one’s really sure that Black’s after Harry —”
There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his fist on the table.
“Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn’t report it in the press because Fudge
wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told
Fudge that Blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: ‘He’s at
Hogwarts…he’s at Hogwarts.’ Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he
thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to power. Black lost everything the night
Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he’s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that…”
There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to hear more.
“Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you’re forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I
don’t think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore’s Headmaster. I suppose he
knows about all this?”
“Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves
around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn’t happy about it, but he agreed.”
“Not happy? Why shouldn’t he be happy, if they’re there to catch Black?”
“Dumbledore isn’t fond of the Azkaban guards,” said Mr. Weasley heavily. “Nor am I, if it
comes to that…but when you’re dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces
with those you’d rather avoid.”
“If they save Harry —”
“– then I will never say another word against them,” said Mr. Weasley wearily. “It’s late, Molly,
we’d better go up…”
Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the passage to the bar and out
of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley were climbing the stairs.
The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he
heard Mr. and Mrs. Wesley’s bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.
Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they
listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron’s room in search of his badge.
“We’ve got it,” Fred whispered to Harry. “We’ve been improving it.”
The badge now read Bighead Boy.
Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down
on his bed.
So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him
because he was so relieved to find him alive. He’d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley
where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to
take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on
the train.
Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didn’t feel more
scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously
thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree
wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore
happened to be. Didn’t people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort
had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort’s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of
him?
And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about. They seemed to scare
most people senseless, and if they were stationed all around the school, Black’s chances of getting
inside seemed very remote.
No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting
Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until
Black was caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the
danger had passed.
He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn’t look after himself? He’d escaped Lord
Voldemort three times; he wasn’t completely useless…
Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What
to do when you know the worst is coming…
“I’m not going to be murdered,” Harry said out loud.
“That’s the spirit, dear,” said his mirror sleepily.
CHAPTER FIVE
THE DEMENTOR
Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got
dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged
his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.
“The sooner we get on the train, the better,” he said. “At least I can get away from Percy at
Hogwarts. Now he’s accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know,”
Ron grimaced, “his girlfriend. She’s hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all
blotchy…”
“I’ve got something to tell you,” Harry began, but they were interrupted by Fred and George,
who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again.
They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily
Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love
potion she’d made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.
“What were you saying?” Ron asked Harry as they sat down.
“Later,” Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.
Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy
heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron’s narrow staircase and piling them up near the
door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy’s screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small
wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.
“It’s all right, Crookshanks,” Hermione cooed through the wickerwork. “I’ll let you out on the
train.”
“You won’t,” snapped Ron. “What about poor Scabbers, eh?”
He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.
Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck his head inside.
“They’re here,” he said. “Harry, come on.”
Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old-
fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of
emerald velvet.
“In you get, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded street.
Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione, Ron, and, to Ron’s
disgust, Percy.
The journey to King’s Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry’s trip on the Knight Bus.
The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide
through gaps that Uncle Vernon’s new company car certainly couldn’t have managed. They reached
King’s Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys, unloaded their
trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to
the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights.
Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry’s elbow all the way into the station.
“Right then,” he said, glancing around them. “Let’s do this in pairs, as there are so many of us.
I’ll go through first with Harry.”
Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry’s trolley
and apparently very interested in the InterCity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a
meaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three-
quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a
platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and had apparently taken
the barrier at a run.
“Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Percy, smoothing his hair and going pink again. Ginny caught
Harry’s eye, and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long,
curly hair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his shiny badge.
Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them, Harry and Mr. Weasley led the
way to the end of the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage that looked quite empty. They
loaded the trunks onto it, stowed Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage rack, then went back
outside to say goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally Harry. He was embarrassed,
but really quite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.
“Do take care, won’t you Harry?” she said as she straightened up, her eyes oddly bright. Then
she opened her enormous handbag and said, “I’ve made you all sandwiches. Here you are, Ron…no,
they’re not corned beef…Fred? Where’s Fred? Here you are dear…”
“Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here for a moment.”
He jerked his head towards a pillar, and Harry followed him behind it, leaving the others
crowded around Mrs. Weasley.
“There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave —” said Mr. Weasley in a tense voice.
“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, “I already know.”
“You know? How could you know?”
“I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Wesley talking last night. I couldn’t help hearing,” Harry
added quickly. “Sorry —”
“That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find out,” said Mr. Weasley looking anxious..
“No — honestly it’sokay. This way, you haven’t broken your word to Fudge and I know what’s
going on.”
“Harry, you must be scared — “
“I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. “Really,” he added, because Mr. Weasley was looking
disbelieving. “I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black can’t be worse than Lord
Voldemort, can he?”
Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name, but overlooked it.
“Harry, I knew you were, well, made of stronger stuff than Fudge seems to think, and I’m
obviously pleased that you’re not scared, but —”
“Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, who was now shepherding the rest onto the train. “Arthur, what
are you doing? It’s about to go!”
“He’s coming Molly!” said Mr. Weasley, but he turned back to Harry and kept talking in a lower
and more hurried voice, “Listen, I want you to give me your word —”
“ — that I’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle?” said Harry gloomily.
“Not entirely,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked more serious than Harry had ever seen him.
“Harry, swear to me you won’t go looking for Black.”
Harry stared, “What!”
There was a loud whistle. Guards were walking along the train, slamming all the doors shut.
“Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more quickly still, “that whatever happens —”
“Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?” said Harry blankly.
“Swear to me that whatever you might hear —”
“Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs. Weasley.
Steam was billowing from the train it had started to move. Harry ran to the compartment door
and Ron threw it open and stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view.
“I need to talk to you in private,” Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione as the train picked up
speed.
“Go away, Ginny,” said Ron.
“Oh, that’s nice,” said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but
all were full except for the one at the very end of the train.
This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and
they had never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.
The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard’s robes that had been darned in
several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked
with gray.
“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut, taking the seats
farthest away from the window.
“Professor R. J. Lupin.” whispered Hermione at once.
“How’d you know that?”
“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man’s head, where there was
a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name
Professor R. J. Lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.
“Wonder what he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t there? Defense Against
the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of
whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good hex would finish him
off, doesn’t he? Anyway…” he turned to Harry, “what were you going to tell us?”
Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Wesley’s argument and the warning Mr. Weasley had
just given him. When he’d finished, Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over
her mouth. She finally lowered them to say, “Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh,
Harry…you’ll have to be really, really careful. don’t go looking for trouble, Harry…”
“I don’t go looking for trouble,” said Harry, nettled. “Trouble usually finds me.”
“How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?” said Ron
shakily.
They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to
be much more frightened of Black than he was.
“No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,” said Ron uncomfortably. “No one’s ever done it
before. And he was a top-security prisoner too.”
“But they’ll catch him, won’t they?” said Hermione earnestly. “I mean, they’ve got all the
Muggles looking out for him too…”
“What’s that noise?” said Ron suddenly.
A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. They looked all around the
compartment.
“It’s coming from your trunk, Harry,” said Ron, standing up and reaching into the luggage rack.
A moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry’s robes. It was
spinning very fast in the palm of Ron’s hand and glowing brilliantly.
“Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.
“Yeah…mind you, it’s a very cheap one,” Ron said. “It went haywire just as I was tying it to
Errol’s leg to send it to Harry.”
“Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?” said Hermione shrewdly.
“No! Well…I wasn’t supposed to be using Errol. You know he’s not really up to long
journeys…but how else was I supposed to get Harry’s present to him?”
“Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake
him up.”
He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible
pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks, which deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.
“We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron, sitting back down. “They sell that sort of
thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff. Fred and George told me.”
“Do you know much about Hogsmeade?” asked Hermione keenly. “I’ve read it’s the only
entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain —”
“Yeah, I think it is,” said Ron in an offhand sort of way. “but that’s not why I want to go. I just
want to get inside Honeydukes!”
“What’s that?” said Hermione.
“It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, “where they’ve got
everything…Pepper Imps — they make you smoke at the mouth — and great fat Chocoballs full of
strawberry mousse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class
and just look like you’re thinking what to write next–”
“But Hogsmeade’s a very interesting place, isn’t it?” Hermione pressed on eagerly. “In Sites of
Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the
Shrieking Shack’s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain —”
“– and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you’re
sucking them,” said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying.
Hermione looked around at Harry.
“Won’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?”
“‘Spect it will,” said Harry heavily. “You’ll have to tell me when you’ve found out.”
“What d’you mean?” said Ron.
“I can’t go. The Dursleys didn’t sign my permission form, and Fudge wouldn’t either.”
Ron looked horrified.
“You’re not allowed to come? But—no way—McGonagall or someone will give you permission —”
Harry gave a hollow laugh. Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor house, was very strict.
“– or we can ask Fred and George, they know every secret passage out of the castle —”
“Ron!” said Hermione sharply. “I don’t think Harry should be sneaking out of the school with
Black on the loose —”
“Yeah, I expect that’s what McGonagall will say when I ask of permission,” said Harry bitterly.
“But if we’re with him,” said Ron spiritedly to Hermione. “Black wouldn’t dare —”
“Oh, Ron, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped Hermione. “Black’s already murdered a whole bunch of
people in the middle of a crowded street, do you really think he’s going to worry about attacking
Harry just because we’re there?”
She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks’s basket as she spoke.
“Don’t let that thing out!” Ron said, but too late; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket,
stretched, yawned, and sprang onto Ron’s knees; the lump in Ron’s pocket trembled and he shoved
Crookshanks angrily away.
“Get out of it!”
“Ron, don’t!” said Hermione angrily.
Ron was about to answer back when Professor Lupin stirred. They watched him apprehensively,
but he simply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly open, and slept on.
The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder
and darker while the clouds overhead thickened overhead. People were chasing backwards and
forwards past the door of their compartment. Crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat, his
squashed face turned towards Ron, his yellow eyes on Ron’s top pocket.
At one o’clock the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door.
“D’you think we should wake him up?” Ron asked awkwardly, nodding towards Professor
Lupin. “He looks like he could do with some food.”
Hermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously.
“Er — Professor?” she said. “Excuse me — Professor?”
He didn’t move.
“Don’t worry, dear,” said the witch, as she handed a large stack of cauldron cakes. “If he’s
hungry when he wakes, I’ll be up front with the driver.”
“I suppose he is asleep?” said Ron quietly, as the witch slid the compartment door closed. “I
mean — he hasn’t died, has he?”
“No, no, he’s breathing,” whispered Hermione, taking the cauldron cake Harry passed her.
He might not be very good company, but Professor Lupin’s presence in their compartment had
its uses. Mid-afternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window,
they heard footsteps outside in the corridor again, and their three least favorite people appeared at
the door: Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.
Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first journey to
Hogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, sneering face, was in Slytherin house; he played Seeker
on the Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that Harry played on the Gryffindor team.
Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They were both wide and muscley;
Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair
and long, gorilla arms.
“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door.
“Potty and the Weasel.”
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.
“I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley,” said Malfoy.
“Did your mother die of shock?”
Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks’s basket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a
snort.
“Who’s that?” said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he spotted Lupin.
“New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back. “What
were you saying, Malfoy?”
Malfoy’s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn’t fool enough to pick a fight right under a teacher’s nose.
“C’mon,” he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they disappeared.
Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.
“I’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,” he said angrily. “I mean it. If he makes
one more crack about my family, I’m going to get hold of his head and —”
Ron made a violent gesture in midair.
“Ron,” hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, “be careful…”
But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.
The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were now a solid,
shimmering gray, which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors
and over the luggage racks. The train rattled, the rain hammered, the wind roared, but still, Professor
Lupin slept.
“We must be nearly there,” said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now
completely black window.
The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.
“Great,” said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside.
“I’m starving. I want to get to the feast…”
“We can’t be there yet,” said Hermione, checking her watch.
“So why’re we stopping?”
The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain
sounded louder than ever against the windows.
Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All along the carriage, heads
were sticking curiously out of their compartments.
The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had
fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went out and they were plunged into
total darkness.
“What’s going on?” said Ron’s voice from behind Harry.
“Ouch!” gasped Hermione. “Ron, that was my foot!”
Harry felt his way back to his seat.
“D’you think we’ve broken down?”
“Dunno…”
There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean
on the window and peering out.
“There’s something moving out there,” Ron said. “I think people are coming aboard…”
The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over Harry’s legs.
“Sorry! D’you know what’s going on? Ouch! Sorry —”
“Hullo, Neville,” said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak.
“Harry? Is that you? What’s happening?”
“No idea! Sit down —”
There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on Crookshanks.
“I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on,” came Hermione’s voice. Harry felt her pass
him, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.
“Who’s that?”
“Who’s that?”
“Ginny?”
“Hermione?”
“What are you doing?”
“I was looking for Ron —”
“Come in and sit down —”
“Not here!” said Harry hurriedly. “I’m here!”
“Ouch!” said Neville.
“Quiet!” said a hoarse voice suddenly.
Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear movements in his corner.
None of them spoke.
There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin
appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked
alert and wary.
“Stay where you are.” he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his
handful of fire held out in front of him.
But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.
Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin’s hand, was a cloaked
figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry’s eyes
darted downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from
the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had
decayed in water…
But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry’s
gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak.
And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as
though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings.
An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in his chest. The cold went
deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside his very heart…
Harry’s eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn’t see. He was drowning in cold. There was a
rushing in his ears as though of water. He was being dragged downward, the roaring growing
louder…
And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to
help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but couldn’t…a thick white fog was swirling around
him, inside him —
“Harry! Harry! Are you all right?”
Someone was slapping his face.
“W-what?”
Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was shaking — the
Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on. He seemed to have slid out of
his seat onto the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see
Neville and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand to push his
glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.
Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.
“Are you okay?” Ron asked nervously.
“Yeah,” said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature had vanished. “What
happened? Where’s that — that thing? Who screamed?”
“No one screamed,” said Ron, more nervously still.
Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked back at him, both very
pale.
“But I heard screaming —”
A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate
into pieces.
“Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. “Eat it. It’ll help.”
Harry took the chocolate but didn’t eat it.
“What was that thing?” he asked Lupin.
“A Dementor,” said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. “One of the
Dementors of Azkaban.”
Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in
his pocket.
“Eat,” he repeated. “It’ll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse me…”
He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.
“Are you sure you’re okay, Harry?” said Hermione, watching Harry anxiously.
“I don’t get it…what happened?” said Harry, wiping more sweat off his face.
“Well — that thing — the Dementor — stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did,
I couldn’t see its face) — and you — you —”
“I thought you were having a fit or something,” said Ron, who still looked scared. “You went
sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching—”
“And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the Dementor, and pulled out his
wand,” said Hermione, “and he said, ‘None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.’ But
the Dementor didn’t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand
at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away…”
“It was horrible,” said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. “Did you feel how cold it got when
it came in?”
“I felt weird,” said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. “Like I’d never be cheerful
again…”
Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob;
Hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her.
“But didn’t any of you — fall off your seats?” said Harry awkwardly.
“No,” said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. “Ginny was shaking like mad, though…”
Harry didn’t understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were recovering from a bad
bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one
else had?
Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around, and said, with a small
smile, “I haven’t poisoned that chocolate, you know…”
Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers
and toes.
“We’ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,” said Professor Lupin. “Are you all right, Harry?”
Harry didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.
“Fine,” he muttered, embarrassed.
They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, the train stopped at
Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and
Neville’s pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was
driving down in icy sheets.
“Firs’ years this way!” called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the
gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new
students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.
“All right, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They waved at him, but had
no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along
the platform. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out
onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each
pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut
the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the chocolate, but still weak.
Ron and Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.
As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates, flanked with stone
columns topped with winged boars, Harry saw two more towering, hooded Dementors, standing
guard on either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the
lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates. The carriage picked up speed on the
long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the
many turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron
got out.
As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear.
“You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actually fainted?”
Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry’s way up the stone steps to the castle, his face
gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously.
“Shove off, Malfoy,” said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.
“Did you faint as well, Weasley?” said Malfoy loudly. “Did the scary old Dementor frighten you
too, Weasley?”
“Is there a problem?” said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage.
Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches on his robes and the
dilapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he said, “Oh, no — er —Professor,”
then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.
Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd
swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous Entrance Hall, which
was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.
The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward it, but
had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called,
“Potter! Granger! I want to see you both!”
Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher
and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the heads of the crowd. She was a stern looking
witch who wore her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry
fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had a way of making
him feel he must have done something wrong.
“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my office,” she told them. “Move
along there, Weasley.”
Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from the chattering
crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.
Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall
motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly,
“Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.”
Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam Pomfrey, the nurse,
came bustling in.
Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he’d passed out, or whatever he
had done, without everyone making all this fuss.
“I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything —”
“Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at
him. “I suppose you’ve been doing something dangerous again?”
“It was a Dementor, Poppy,” said Professor McGonagall.
They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly.
“Setting Dementors around a school,” she muttered, pushing back Harry’s hair and feeling his
forehead. “He won’t be the last one who collapses. Yes, he’s all clammy. Terrible things, they are,
and the effect they have on people who are already delicate —”
“I’m not delicate!” said Harry crossly.
“Of course you’re not,” said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking his pulse.
“What does he need?” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “Bed rest? Should he perhaps spend
tonight in the hospital wing?”
“I’m fine!” said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to
go to the hospital wing was torture.
“Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,” said Madam Pomfrey, who was now
trying to peer into Harry’s eyes.
“I’ve already had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.”
“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So we’ve finally got a Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?”
“Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?” Professor McGonagall said sharply.
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her course
schedule, then we can go down to the feast together.”
Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing,
muttering to herself. He had to wait only a few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very
happy about something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way
back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall.
It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was lined with students, their
faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in midair.
Professor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient
hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall.
“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!”
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting Hat, which shouted
out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor
McGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in
the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor table. People looked around at
them as they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story of
his collapsing in front of the Dementor traveled that fast?
He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them seats.
“What was all that about?” he muttered to Harry.
Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and
he broke off.
Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of great energy. He had
several feet of long silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He
was often described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn’t why Harry respected him. You
couldn’t help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry watched him beaming around at the
students, he felt really calm for the first time since the Dementor had entered the train
compartment.
“Welcome!” said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard. “Welcome to another
year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it
best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast…”
Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, “As you will all be aware after their search of the
Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the Dementors of Azkaban, who
are here on Ministry of Magic business.”
He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about Dumbledore not being
happy with the Dementors guarding the school.
“They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,” Dumbledore continued, “and while they
are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are
not to be fooled by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks,” he added blandly, and Harry
and Ron glanced at each other. “It is not in the nature of a Dementor to understand pleading or
excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to
the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the
Dementors,” he said.
Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest again and stared
around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked very seriously around the hall, and
nobody moved or made a sound.
“On a happier note,” he continued, “I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this
year.
“First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher.”
There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who had been in the
compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin
looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes.
“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.
Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at Professor Lupin. It was
common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who
hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. it was beyond anger: it was
loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape wore every time he set eyes
on Harry.
“As to our second new appointment,” Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for
Professor Lupin died away. “Well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of
Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his
remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than
Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they joined in with the
applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in particular. Harry leaned forward to see
Hagrid, who was ruby red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide grin hidden
in the tangle of his black beard.
“We should’ve known!” Ron roared, pounding the table. “Who else would have assigned us a
biting book?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started
speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.
“Well, I think that’s everything of importance,” said Dumbledore. “Let the feast begin!”
The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink. Harry, suddenly
ravenous, helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat.
It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the clatter of knives and forks.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid.
They knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn’t a fully qualified
wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed. It
had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid’s name last year.
At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters,
Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed, and they got their chance.
“Congratulations, Hagrid!” Hermione squealed as they reached the teachers’ table.
“All down ter you three,” said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at
them. “Can’ believe it…great man, Dumbledore…came straight down to me hut after Professor
Kettleburn said he’d had enough…It’s what I always wanted…”
Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor McGonagall shooed
them away.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and, very
tired now, along more corridors, up more and more stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor
Tower, where a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them, “Password?”
“Coming through, coming through!” Percy called from behind the crowd. “The new password’s
Fortuna Major!”
“Oh no,” said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble remembering the passwords.
Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys divided toward their
separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was
to be back. They reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster beds, and Harry,
looking around, felt he was home at last.
CHAPTER SIX
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first
thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a
very funny story. As they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was
a roar of laughter.
“Ignore him,” said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. “Just ignore him, it’s not worth
it…”
“Hey, Potter!” shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face like a pug. “Potter! The
Dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!”
Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George Weasley.
“New third-year course schedules,” said George, passing then, over. “What’s up with you,
Harry?”
“Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting down on George’s other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.
George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror again.
“That little git,” he said calmly. “He wasn’t so cocky last night when the Dementors were down
at our end of the train. Came running into our compartment, didn’t he, Fred?”
“Nearly wet himself,” said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.
“I wasn’t too happy myself,” said George. “They’re horrible things, those Dementors…”
“Sort of freeze your insides, don’t they?” said Fred.
“You didn’t pass out, though, did you?” said Harry in a low voice.
“Forget it, Harry,” said George bracingly. “Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember,
Fred? And he said it was the worst place he’d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking…They
suck the happiness out of a place, Dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.”
“Anyway, we’ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match,” said Fred.
“Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?”
The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had
definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried
tomatoes.
Hermione was examining her new schedule.
“Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,” she said happily.
“Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, “they’ve messed up your
timetable. Look — they’ve got you down for about ten subjects a day. There isn’t enough time.”
“I’ll manage. I’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.”
“But look,” said Ron, laughing, “see this morning? Nine o’clock, Divination. And underneath,
nine o’clock, Muggle Studies. And —” Ron leaned closer to the timetable, disbelieving, “look—
underneath that, Arithmancy, nine o’clock. I mean, I know you’re good, Hermione, but no one’s that
good. How’re you supposed to be in three classes at once?”
“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione shortly. “Of course I won’t be in three classes at once.”
“Well then —”
“Pass the marmalade,” said Hermione.
“But —”
“Oh, Ron, what’s it to you if my timetable’s a bit full?” Hermione snapped. “I told you, I’ve
fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.”
Just then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. He was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was
absent-mindedly swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand.
“All righ’?” he said eagerly, pausing on his way to the staff table. “Yer in my firs’ ever lesson!
Right after lunch! Bin up since five getting’ everthin’ ready…hope it’sokay…me, a
teacher…hones’ly…”
He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table, still swinging the polecat.
“Wonder what he’s been getting ready?” said Ron, a note of anxiety in his voice.
The Hall was starting to empty as people headed off towards their first lesson. Ron checked his
schedule.
“We’d better go, look, Divination’s at the top of North Tower. It’ll take us ten minutes to get
there…”
They finished breakfast hastily, said goodbye to Fred and George and walked back through the
hall. As they passed the Slytherin table, Malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit. The
shouts of laughter followed Harry into the Entrance Hall.
The journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one. Two years at Hogwarts hadn’t
taught them everything about the castle, and they had never been inside North Tower before.
“There’s — got — to — be — a — short — cut,” Ron panted, as they climbed the seventh long
staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing, where there was nothing but a large painting of a
bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall.
“I think it’s this way,” said Hermione, peering down the empty passage to the right.
“Can’t be,” said Ron. “That’s south. Look, you can see a bit of the lake outside the window…”
Harry was watching the painting. A fat, dappled-gray pony had just ambled onto the grass and
was grazing nonchalantly. Harry was used to the subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and
leaving their frames to visit each other, but he always enjoyed watching them. A moment later, a
short, squat knight in a suit of armour had clanked into the picture after his pony. By the look of the
grass stains on his metal knees, he had just fallen off.
“Aha!” he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron and Hermione. “What villains are these, that trespass upon
my private lands! Come to scorn at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!”
They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began
brandishing it violently, hopping up and down in rage. But the sword was too long for him; a
particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.
“Are you all right?” said Harry, moving closer to the picture.
“Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!”
The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply
into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn’t get it out again. Finally, he had
to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.
“Listen,” said Harry, taking advantage of the knight’s exhaustion, “we’re looking for the North
Tower. You don’t know the way, do you?”
“A quest!” The knight’s rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted,
“Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!”
He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and
cried, “On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!”
And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of sight.
They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his armor. Every now and
then they spotted him running through a picture ahead.
“Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the knight, and they saw him reappear in
front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral
staircase.
Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier
and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the
classroom.
“Farewell!” cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some sinister-looking monks.
“Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir
Cadogan!”
“Yeah, we’ll call you,” muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, “if we ever need someone
mental.”
They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where most of the class was
already assembled. There were no doors off this landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the
ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.
“‘Sybill Trelawney, Divination teacher,’” Harry read. “How’re we supposed to get up there?”
As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder
descended right at Harry’s feet. Everyone got quiet.
“After you,” said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.
He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In fact, it didn’t look like a
classroom at all, more like a cross between someone’s attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At least
twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little
poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and
the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was
burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a
large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking
feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a
huge array of teacups.
Ron appeared at Harry’s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.
“Where is she?” Ron said.
A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.
“Welcome,” it said. “How nice to see you in the physical world at last.”
Harry’s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into
the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times
their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung
around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings.
“Sit, my children, sit,” she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto
poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table.
“Welcome to Divination,” said Professor Trelawney, who had seated herself in a winged
armchair in front of the fire. “My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I
find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.”
Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately
rearranged her shawl and continued, “So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of
all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I
will be able to teach you…Books can take you only so far in this field…”
At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the
news that books wouldn’t be much help in this subject.
“Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and
sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,” Professor
Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. “It is a Gift
granted to few. You, boy,” she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. “Is your
grandmother well?”
“I think so,” said Neville tremulously.
“I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you, dear,” said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her
long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly. “We will be covering
the basic methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves.
Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,” she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil,
“beware a red-haired man.”
Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged her chair away from
him.
“In the second term,” Professor Trelawney went on, “we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we
have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty
bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us for
ever.”
A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of
it.
“I wonder, dear,” she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, “if
you could pass me the largest silver teapot?”
Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down
on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.
“Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading — it will happen on Friday the
sixteenth of October.”
Lavender trembled.
“Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will
fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three
times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the last of the tea to
drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. You will interpret the patterns using pages
five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and
dear,” — she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up, “after you’ve broken your first cup,
would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I’m rather attached to the pink.”
Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of
breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said, “One
of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn’t mind…thank you…”
When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to
drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed,
then drained the cups and swapped over.
“Right,” said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six. “What can you see in
mine?”
“A load of soggy brown stuff,” said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making
him feel sleepy and stupid.
“Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane!” Professor
Trelawney cried through the gloom.
Harry tried to pull himself together.
“Right, you’ve got a crooked sort of cross…” He consulted Unfogging the Future. “That means
you’re going to have ‘trials and suffering’ — sorry about that — but there’s a thing that could be the
sun. Hang on…that means ‘great happiness’…so you’re going to suffer but be very happy…”
“You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,” said Ron, and they both had to stifle their
laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction.
“My turn…” Ron peered into Harry’s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort. “There’s a blob
a bit like a bowler hat,” he said. “Maybe you’re going to work for the Ministry of Magic…”
He turned the teacup the other way up.
“But this way it looks more like an acorn…what’s that?” He scanned his copy of Unfogging the
Future. “‘A windfall, unexpected gold.’ Excellent, you can lend me some. And there’s a thing here,”
he turned the cup again, “that looks like an animal…yeah, if that was its head…it looks like a
hippo…no, a sheep…”
Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.
“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry’s
cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.
Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it counterclockwise.
“The falcon…my dear, you have a deadly enemy.”
“But everyone knows that,” said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her.
“Well, they do,” said Hermione. “Everybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who.”
Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration. They had never
heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before. Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She
lowered her huge eyes to Harry’s cup again and continued to turn it.
“The club…an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup…”
“I thought that was a bowler hat,” said Ron sheepishly.
“The skull…danger in your path, my dear…”
Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped,
and then screamed.
There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his second cup. Professor
Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed.
“My dear boy — my poor dear boy — no — it is kinder not to say — no — don’t ask me…”
“What is it, Professor?” said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to their feet, and slowly
they crowded around Harry and Ron’s table, pressing close to Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a
good look at Harry’s cup.
“My dear,” Professor Trelawney’s huge eyes opened dramatically, “you have the Grim.”
“The what?” said Harry.
He could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him
and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths
in horror.
“The Grim, my dear, the Grim!” cried Professor Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry
hadn’t understood. “The giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen —
the worst omen — of death!”
Harry’s stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts — the
dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent…Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too.
Everyone was looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around
to the back of Professor Trelawney’s chair.
“I don’t think it looks like a Grim,” she said flatly.
Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike.
“You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little
receptivity to the resonances of the future.”
Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.
“It looks like a Grim if you do this,” he said, with his eyes almost shut, “but it looks more like a
donkey from here,” he said, leaning to the left.
“When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going to die or not!” said Harry, taking even
himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at him.
“I think we will leave the lesson here for today,” said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice.
“Yes…please pack away your things…”
Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney, packed away their books, and
closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry’s eyes.
“Until we meet again,” said Professor Trelawney faintly, “fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear,”
— she pointed at Neville, “you’ll be late next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney’s ladder and the winding stair in
silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall’s Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find
her classroom that, early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.
Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright
spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop
dead at any moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi
(wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn’t even watching when she transformed
herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.
“Really, what has got into you all today?” said Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself
with a faint pop, and staring around at them all. “Not that it matters, but that’s the first time my
transformation’s not got applause from a class.”
Everybody’s heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then Hermione raised her
hand.
“Please, Professor, we’ve just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves,
and —”
“Ah, of course,” said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. “There is no need to say any
more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?”
Everyone stared at her.
“Me,” said Harry, finally.
“I see,” said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes. “Then you should know,
Potter, that Sybill Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this
school. None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If
it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues —” Professor McGonagall broke off,
and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly, “Divination is one of the
most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with
it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney…”
She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, “You look in excellent health to
me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don’t let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die,
you need not hand it in.”
Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves
away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney’s classroom. Not
everyone was convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, “But what
about Neville’s cup?”
When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great
Hall for lunch.
“Ron, cheer up,” said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. “You heard what Professor
McGonagall said.”
Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn’t start.
“Harry,” he said, in a low, serious voice, “You haven’t seen a great black dog anywhere, have
you?”
“Yeah, I have,” said Harry. “I saw one the night I left the Dursleys’.”
Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.
“Probably a stray,” said Hermione calmly.
Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.
“Hermione, if Harry’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s bad,” he said. “My — my uncle Bilius saw
one and — and he died twenty-four hours later!”
“Coincidence,” said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” said Ron, starting to get angry. “Grims scare the
living daylights out of most wizards!”
“There you are, then,” said Hermione in a superior tone. “They see the Grim and die of fright.
The Grim’s not an omen, it’s the cause of death! And Harry’s still with us because he’s not stupid
enough to see one and think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!”
Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy
book, and propped it open against the juice jug.
“I think Divination seems very woolly,” she said, searching for her page. “A lot of guesswork, if
you ask me.”
“There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!” said Ron hotly.
“You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep,” said Hermione
coolly.
“Professor Trelawney said you didn’t have the right aura! You just don’t like being bad at
something for a change!”
He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the table so hard
that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.
“If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves,
I’m not sure I’ll be studying it much longer! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my
Arithmancy class!”
She snatched up her bag and stalked away.
Ron frowned after her.
“What’s she talking about?” he said to Harry. “She hasn’t been to an Arithmancy class yet.”
Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday’s rain had cleared; the sky was a
clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care
of Magical Creatures class.
Ron and Hermione weren’t speaking to each other. Harry walked beside them in silence as they
went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid’s hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when
he spotted three only-too-familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these
lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were
chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about.
Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his moleskin overcoat, with
Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start.
“C’mon, now, get a move on!” he called as the class approached. “Got a real treat for yeh today!
Great lesson comin’ up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!”
For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest; Harry
had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off
around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of
paddock. There was nothing in there.
“Everyone gather ‘round the fence here!” he called. “That’s it — make sure yeh can see— now,
firs’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books—”
“How?” said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.
“Eh?” said Hagrid.
“How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of The Monster Book of
Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other people took theirs out too; some,
like Harry, had belted their book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them
together with binder clips.
“Hasn’ — hasn’ anyone bin able ter open their books?” said Hagrid, looking crestfallen.
The class all shook their heads.
“Yeh’ve got ter stroke ‘em,” said Hagrid, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world.
“Look —”
He took Hermione’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The book tried to bite,
but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay
quiet in his hand.
“Oh, how silly we’ve all been!” Malfoy sneered. “We should have stroked them! Why didn’t we
guess!”
“I — I thought they were funny,” Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione.
“Oh, tremendously funny!” said Malfoy. “Really witty, giving us books that try and rip our
hands off!”
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid’s
first lesson to be a success.
“Righ’ then,” said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, “so — so yeh’ve got yer books
an’…an’…now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I’ll go an’ get ‘em. Hang on…”
He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight.
“God, this place is going to the dogs,” said Malfoy loudly. “That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll
have a fit when I tell him —”
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry repeated.
“Careful, Potter, there’s a Dementor behind you —”
“Oooooooh!” squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock.
Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry had ever seen. They had
the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be
giant eagles, with cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes. The talons on their
front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar
around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the vast
hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures.
“Gee up, there!” he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where
the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the
fence.
“Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. “Beau’iful, aren’ they?”
Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first shock of seeing
something that was half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the Hippogriffs’ gleaming coats,
changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze, pinkish
roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black.
“So,” said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, “if yeh wan’ ter come a bit
nearer…”
No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence
cautiously.
“Now, firs’ thing yeh gotta know abou’ Hippogriffs is, they’re proud,” said Hagrid. “Easily
offended, Hippogriffs are. Don’t never insult one, ‘cause it might be the last thing yeh do.”
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren’t listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a
nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson.
“Yeh always wait fer the Hippogriff ter make the firs’ move,” Hagrid continued. “It’s polite, see?
Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an’ yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If
he doesn’ bow, then get away from him sharpish, ‘cause those talons hurt.”
“Right — who wants ter go first?”
Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had
misgivings. The Hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they
didn’t seem to like being tethered like this.
“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look.
“I’ll do it,” said Harry.
There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered,
“Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!”
Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence.
“Good man, Harry!” roared Hagrid. “Right then — let’s see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.”
He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray Hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its
leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy’s
eyes were narrowed maliciously.
“Easy now, Harry,” said Hagrid quietly. “Yeh’ve got eye contact, now try not ter
blink…Hippogriffs don’ trust yeh if yeh blink too much…”
Harry’s eyes immediately began to water, but he didn’t shut them. Buckbeak had turned his
great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye. “Tha’s it,” said Hagrid. “Tha’s
it, Harry…now, bow.”
Harry didn’t feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was
told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.
The Hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn’t move.
“Ah,” said Hagrid, sounding worried. “Right — back away, now, Harry, easy does it —”
But then, to Harry’s enormous surprise, the Hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and
sank into what was an unmistakable bow.
“Well done, Harry!” said Hagrid, ecstatic. “Right — yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!”
Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly toward the
Hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the beak several times and the Hippogriff closed its
eyes lazily, as though enjoying it.
The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking
deeply disappointed.
“Righ’ then, Harry,” said Hagrid. “I reckon he migh’ let yeh ride him!”
This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick; but he wasn’t sure a
Hippogriff would be quite the same.
“Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said Hagrid, “an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his
feathers out, he won’ like that…”
Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak’s wing and hoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak
stood up. Harry wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered with feathers.
“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the Hippogriffs hindquarters.
Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry, he just had time to
seize the Hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward. It was nothing like a
broomstick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the Hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on
either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off;
the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead of the
smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as
the hindquarters of the Hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the
bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip
off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed
to hold on and push himself straight again.
“Good work, Harry!” roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered.
“Okay, who else wants a go?”
Emboldened by Harry’s success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock.
Hagrid untied the Hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the
paddock. Neville ran repeatedly backward from his, which didn’t seem to want to bend its knees.
Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now
patting his beak, looking disdainful.
“This is very easy,” Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him. “I knew it must have
been, if Potter could do it…I bet you’re not dangerous at all, are you?” he said to the Hippogriff.
“Are you, you great ugly brute?”
It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high pitched scream and next moment,
Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in
the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.
“I’m dying!” Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. “I’m dying, look at me! It’s killed me!”
“Yer not dyin’!” said Hagrid, who had gone very white. “Someone help me — gotta get him
outta here —”
Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As they passed, Harry saw
that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy’s arm; blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with
him, up the slope toward the castle.
Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The Slytherins were all
shouting about Hagrid.
“They should sack him straight away!” said Pansy Parkinson, who was in tears.
“It was Malfoy’s fault!” snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles
threateningly.
They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.
“I’m going to see if he’s okay!” said Pansy, and they all watched her run up the marble staircase.
The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon
common room; Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.
“You think he’ll be all right?” said Hermione nervously.
“Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,” said Harry, who had had
far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.
“That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid’s first class, though, wasn’t it?” said Ron,
looking worried. “Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him…” They were among the first to reach
the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn’t there.
“They wouldn’t fire him, would they?” said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steak-and-
kidney pudding.
“They’d better not,” said Ron, who wasn’t eating either.
Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe and Goyle was huddled
together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how
Malfoy had been injured.
“Well, you can’t say it wasn’t an interesting first day back,” said Ron gloomily.
They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the
homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of them kept breaking off and
glancing out of the tower window.
“There’s a light on in Hagrid’s window,” Harry said suddenly.
Ron looked at his watch.
“If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It’s still quite early…”
“I don’t know,” Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him.
“I’m allowed to walk across the grounds,” he said pointedly. “Sirius Black hasn’t got past the
Dementors yet, has he?”
So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad to meet nobody on their
way to the front doors, as they weren’t entirely sure they were supposed to be out.
The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When they reached Hagrid’s hut,
they knocked, and a voice growled, “C’min.”
Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his
head in Hagrid’s lap. One look told them that Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter
tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them
into focus.
“‘Spect it’s a record,” he said thickly, when he recognized them. “Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a
teacher who lasted on’y a day before.”
“You haven’t been fired, Hagrid!” gasped Hermione.
“Not yet,” said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard. “But’s only
a matter o’ time, I’n’t, after Malfoy…”
“How is he?” said Ron as they all sat down. “It wasn’t serious, was it?”
“Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said Hagrid dully, “but he’s sayin’ it’s still
agony…covered in bandages…moanin’…”
“He’s faking it,” said Harry at once. “Madam Pomfrey can mend anything. She regrew half my
bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it’s worth.”
“School gov’nors have bin told, o’ course,” said Hagrid miserably. “They reckon I started too
big. Shoulda left Hippogriffs fer later…one flobberworms or summat…Jus’ thought it’d make a
good firs’ lesson’s all my fault…”
“It’s all Malfoy’s fault, Hagrid!” said Hermione earnestly.
“We’re witnesses,” said Harry. “You said Hippogriffs attack if you insult them. It’s Malfoy’s
problem that he wasn’t listening. We’ll tell Dumbledore what really happened.”
“Yeah, don’t worry, Hagrid, we’ll back you up,” said Ron.
Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry
and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.
“I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,” said Hermione firmly. She took the tankard from
the table and went outside to empty it.
“Ah, maybe she’s right,” said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away,
rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily
outside. They heard a loud splash.
“What’s he done?” said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the empty tankard.
“Stuck his head in the water barrel,” said Hermione, putting the tankard away.
Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water out of his eyes.
“That’s better,” he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all. “Listen, it was good
of yeh ter come an’ see me, I really —”
Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he’d only just realized he was there.
“WHAT D’YEH THINK YOU’RE DOIN’, EH?” he roared, so suddenly that they jumped a
foot in the air. “YEH’RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN’ AROUND AFTER DARK, HARRY! AN,
YOU TWO! LETTIN’ HIM!”
Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the door.
“C’mon!” Hagrid said angrily. “I’m takin’ yer all back up ter school an’ don’ let me catch yeh
walkin’ down ter see me after dark again. I’m not worth that!”
CHAPTER SEVEN
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE
Malfoy didn’t reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when the Slytherins and
Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm
covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry’s opinion, as though he were the
heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.
“How is it, Draco?” simpered Pansy Parkinson. “Does it hurt much?”
“Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and
Goyle when Pansy had looked away.
“Settle down, settle down,” said Professor Snape idly.
Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn’t have said ‘settle down’ if they’d walked in
late, he’d have given them detention. But Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in
Snape’s classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generally favored his own students above all
others.
They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right
next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table.
“Sir,” Malfoy called, “sir, I’ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm —”
“Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him,” said Snape without looking up.
Ron went brick red.
“There’s nothing wrong with your arm,” he hissed at Malfoy.
Malfoy smirked across the table.
“Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.”
Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy’s roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that
they were all different sizes.
“Professor,” drawled Malfoy, “Weasley’s mutilating my roots, sir.”
Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an
unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair.
“Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.”
“But, sir —!”
Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal
pieces.
“Now,” said Snape in his most dangerous voice.
Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at Malfoy, then took up the knife
again.
“And, sir, I’ll need this shrivelfig skinned,” said Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.
“Potter, you can skin Malfoy’s shrivelfig,” said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he
always reserved just for him.
Harry took Malfoy’s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had
to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy
without speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.
“Seen your pal Hagrid lately?” he asked them quietly.
“None of your business,” said Ron jerkily, without looking up.
“I’m afraid he won’t be a teacher much longer,” said Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow. “Father’s
not very happy about my injury —”
“Keep talking, Malfoy, and I’ll give you a real injury,” snarled Ron.
“– he’s complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of Magic. Father’s got a lot of
influence, you know. And a lasting injury like this” — he gave a huge, fake sigh — “who knows if
my arm’ll ever be the same again?”
“So that’s why you’re putting it on,” said Harry, accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar
because his hand was shaking in anger, “To try to get Hagrid fired.”
“Well,” said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, “partly, Potter. But there are other benefits
too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.”
A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons;
it was his worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His
potion, which was supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned —
“Orange, Longbottom,” said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the
cauldron, so that everyone could see.
“Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn’t you hear me
say, quite clearly, that only one cat spleen was needed? Didn’t I state plainly that a dash of leech juice
would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?”
Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge of tears.
“Please, sir,” said Hermione, “please, I could help Neville put it right -”
“I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,” said Snape coldly, and Hermione
went as pink as Neville. “Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this
potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.”
Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.
“Help me!” he moaned to Hermione.
“Hey, Harry,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry’s brass scales, “have you
heard? Daily Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black’s been sighted.”
“Where?” said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table, Malfoy looked up,
listening closely.
“Not too far from here,” said Seamus, who looked excited. “It was a Muggle who saw him.
‘Course, she didn’t really understand. The Muggles think he’s just an ordinary criminal, don’t they?
So she phoned the telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was gone.”
“Not too far from here…” Ron repeated, looking significantly at Harry. He turned around and
saw Malfoy watching closely. “What, Malfoy? Need something else skinned?”
But Malfoy’s eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry. He leaned across the
table.
“Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry offhandedly.
Malfoy’s thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.
“Of course, if it was me,” he said quietly, “I’d have done something before now. I wouldn’t be
staying in school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for him.”
“What are you talking about, Malfoy?” said Ron roughly.
“Don’t you know, Potter?” breathed Malfoy, his pale eyes narrowed.
“Know what?”
Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.
“Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck,” he said. “Want to leave it to the Dementors, do you?
But if it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself.”
“What are you talking about?” said Harry angrily, but at that moment Snape called, “You should
have finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so
clear away while it simmers and then we’ll test Longbottom’s…”
Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly.
Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn’t
see. Harry and Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in
the stone basin in the corner.
“What did Malfoy mean?” Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that
poured from the gargoyle’s mouth “Why would I want revenge on Black? He hasn’t done anything
to me — yet.”
“He’s making it up,” said Ron savagely. “He’s trying to make you do something stupid…”
The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was cowering by his cauldron.
“Everyone gather ‘round,” said Snape, his black eyes glittering, “and watch what happens to
Longbottom’s toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole.
If, as I don’t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.”
The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape picked up Trevor the
toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville’s potion, which was now green. He
trickled a few drops down Trevor’s throat.
There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there was a small pop, and
Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape’s palm.
The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket
of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown.
“Five points from Gryffindor,” said Snape, which wiped the smiles from every face. “I told you
not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry was still thinking about
what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about Snape.
“Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right! Why didn’t you lie, Hermione?
You should’ve said Neville did it all by himself!”
Hermione didn’t answer. Ron looked around.
“Where is she?”
Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the rest of the class pass
them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.
“She was right behind us,” said Ron, frowning.
Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at Harry and disappeared.
“There she is,” said Harry.
Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched her bag, the other
seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes.
“How did you do that?” said Ron.
“What?” said Hermione, joining them.
“One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at the bottom of the
stairs again.”
“What?” Hermione looked slightly confused. “Oh — I had to go back for something. Oh no —”
A seam had split on Hermione’s bag. Harry wasn’t surprised; he could see that it was crammed
with at least a dozen large and heavy books.
“Why are you carrying all these around with you?” Ron asked her.
“You know how many subjects I’m taking,” said Hermione breathlessly. “Couldn’t hold these
for me, could you?”
“But —” Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at the covers. “You
haven’t got any of these subjects today. It’s only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.”
“Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same.
“I hope there’s something good for lunch, I’m starving,” she added, and she marched off toward the
Great Hall.
“D’you get the feeling Hermione’s not telling us something?” Ron asked Harry.
Professor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at his first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.
They all sat down, took out their books, quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally
entered the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher’s desk. He
was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few
square meals.
“Good afternoon,” he said. “Would you please put all your books back in your bags. Today’s
will be a practical lesson. You will need only your wands.”
A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books. They had never had a
practical Defense Against the Dark Arts class before, unless you counted the memorable class last
year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose.
“Right then,” said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. “If you’d follow me.”
Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom.
He led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was
Peeves the Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with
chewing gum.
Peeves didn’t look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; then he wiggled his curly-toed
feet and broke into song.
“Loony, loopy Lupin,” Peeves sang. “Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy Lupin —”
Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually showed some respect toward the
teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise,
he was still smiling.
“I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,” he said pleasantly. “Mr. Filch won’t
be able to get in to his brooms.”
Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who waged a constant war
against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However, Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin’s
words, except to blow a loud wet raspberry.
Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand.
“This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his shoulder. “Please watch closely.”
He raised the wand to shoulder height, said, “Waddiwasi!” and pointed it at Peeves.
With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down
Peeves’s left nostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing.
“Cool, sir!” said Dean Thomas in amazement.
“Thank you, Dean,” said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again. “Shall we proceed?”
They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with increased respect. He led
them down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the staffroom door.
“Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.
The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was empty except for one
teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His
eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As Professor Lupin came
in and made to close the door behind him, Snape said, “Leave it open, Lupin. I’d rather not witness
this.” He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing behind him. At the
doorway he turned on his heel and said, “Possibly no one’s warned you, Lupin, but this class
contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not
unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear.”
Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he bullied Neville in his own
classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers.
Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.
“I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I
am sure he will perform it admirably.”
Neville’s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape’s lip curled, but he left, shutting the door with
a snap.
“Now, then,” said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of the room, where there
was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went
to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
“Nothing to worry about,” said Professor Lupin calmly because a few people had jumped
backward in alarm. “There’s a Boggart in there.”
Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin
a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds,
the cupboards under sinks — I’ve even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This
one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my
third years some practice.
“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a Boggart?”
Hermione put up her hand.
“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.”
“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed. “So the
Boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will
frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a Boggart looks like when he
is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.
“This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville’s small sputter of terror, “that we
have a huge advantage over the Boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?”
Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and down on the balls of
her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go.
“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should be?”
“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little
disappointed. “It’s always best to have company when you’re dealing with a Boggart. He becomes
confused. Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a Boggart
make that very mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug.
Not remotely frightening.
‘The charm that repels a Boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that
really finishes a Boggart is laughter. What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find
amusing.
“We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please…Riddikulus!”
“Riddikulus!” said the class together.
“Good,” said Professor Lupin. “Very good. But that was the easy part, I’m afraid. You see, the
word alone is not enough. And this is where you come in, Neville.”
The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked forward as though he
were heading for the gallows.
“Right, Neville,” said Professor Lupin. “First things first: what would you say is the thing that
frightens you most in the world?”
Neville’s lips moved, but no noise came out.
“I didn’t catch that, Neville, sorry,” said Professor Lupin cheerfully.
Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in
barely more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.”
Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor Lupin, however, looked
thoughtful.
“Professor Snape…hmmm…Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?”
“Er — yes,” said Neville nervously. “But — I don’t want the Boggart to turn into her either.”
“No, no, you misunderstand me,” said Professor Lupin, now smiling. “I wonder, could you tell
us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?”
Neville looked startled, but said, “Well…always the same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture
on top. And a long dress…green, normally…and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.”
“And a handbag?” prompted Professor Lupin.
“A big red one,” said Neville.
“Right then,” said Professor Lupin. “Can you picture those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you
see them in your mind’s eye?”
“Yes,” said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next.
“When the Boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees you, it will assume the form of
Professor Snape,” said Lupin. “And you will raise your wand — thus — and cry ‘Riddikulus’ — and
concentrate hard on your grandmother’s clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be
forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag.”
There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more violently.
“If Neville is successful, the Boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn,” said
Professor Lupin. “I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you
most, and imagine how you might force it to look comical…”
The room went quiet. Harry thought…What scared him most in the world?
His first thought was Lord Voldemort — a Voldemort returned to full strength. But before he
had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a Boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came
floating to the surface of his mind…
A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak…a long, rattling breath from an
unseen mouth…then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning…
Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many people had their eyes
shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, “Take its legs off.” Harry was sure he knew what that was
about. Ron’s greatest fear was spiders.
“Everyone ready?” said Professor Lupin.
Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn’t ready. How could you make a Dementor less frightening?
But he didn’t want to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.
“Neville, we’re going to back away,” said Professor Lupin. “Let you have a clear field, all right?
I’ll call the next person forward…Everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot —”
They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone beside the wardrobe. He
looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand
ready.
“On the count of three, Neville,” said Professor Lupin, who was pointing his own wand at the
handle of the wardrobe. “One — two — three —now!”
A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin’s wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe
burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.
Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him,
reaching inside his robes.
“R — r — Riddikulus! “ squeaked Neville.
There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress
and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.
There was a roar of laughter; the Boggart paused, confused, and Professor Lupin shouted,
“Parvati! Forward!”
Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was another crack, and where
he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it
began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising —
“Riddikulus!” cried Parvati.
A bandage unraveled at the mummy’s feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head
rolled off.
“Seamus!” roared Professor Lupin.
Seamus darted past Parvati.
Crack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal,
green-tinged face — a banshee. She opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room,
a long, wailing shriek that made the hair on Harry’s head stand on end — “Riddikulus!” shouted
Seamus.
The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was gone.
Crack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle, then —crack!- became a
rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before —crack! — becoming a single, bloody eyeball.
“It’s confused!” shouted Lupin. “We’re getting there! Dean!”
Dean hurried forward.
Crack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began to creep along the floor
like a crab.
“Riddikulus!” yelled Dean.
There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.
“Excellent! Ron, you next!”
Ron leapt forward.
Crack!
Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered in hair, was advancing on
Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then —
“Riddikulus!” bellowed Ron, and the spider’s legs vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender
Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at Harry’s feet. He raised his wand,
ready, but —
“Here!” shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!
The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly around to see where it
was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin, who said, “Riddikulus!”
almost lazily.
Crack!
“Forward, Neville, and finish him off!” said Lupin as the Boggart landed on the floor as a
cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville charged forward looking determined.
“Riddikulus!” he shouted, and they had a split second’s view of Snape in his lacy dress before
Neville let out a great “Ha!” of laughter, and the Boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps
of smoke, and was gone.
“Excellent!” cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause. “Excellent, Neville. Well
done, everyone…Let me see…five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the Boggart — ten
for Neville because he did it twice…and five each to Hermione and Harry.”
“But I didn’t do anything,” said Harry.
“You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, Harry,” Lupin said
lightly. “Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on Boggarts
and summarize it for me…o be handed in on Monday. That will be all.”
Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn’t feeling cheerful. Professor
Lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the Boggart. Why? Was it because he’d seen
Harry collapse on the train, and thought he wasn’t up to much? Had he thought Harry would pass
out again?
But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.
“Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted Seamus.
“And the hand!” said Dean, waving his own around.
“And Snape in that hat!”
“And my mummy!”
“I wonder why Professor Lupin’s frightened of crystal balls?” said Lavender thoughtfully.
“That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we’ve ever had, wasn’t it?” said Ron
excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags.
“He seems like a very good teacher,” said Hermione approvingly. “But I wish I could have had a
turn with the Boggart —”
“What would it have been for you?” said Ron, sniggering. “A piece of homework that only got
nine out of ten?”
CHAPTER EIGHT
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY
In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most people’s favorite class. Only
Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.
“Look at the state of his robes,” Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed.
“He dresses like our old house elf.”
But no one else cared that Professor Lupin’s robes were patched and frayed. His next few lessons
were just as interesting as the first. After Boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin-like
creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles and the potholes
of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved
on to Kappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to
strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.
Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst of all was Potions.
Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story
of the Boggart assuming Snape’s shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grandmother’s
clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn’t seem to find it funny. His eyes
flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor Lupin’s name, and he was bullying Neville
worse than ever.
Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor Trelawney’s stifling tower room,
deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous
eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn’t like Professor Trelawney, even
though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and
Lavender Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney’s tower room at lunch times, and
always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though they knew things the others
didn’t. They had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were
on his deathbed.
Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the action-packed first class, had
become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson
after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the most boring
creatures in existence.
“Why would anyone bother looking after them?” said Ron, after yet another hour of poking
shredded lettuce down the flobberworms’ throats.
At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy him, something so
enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes. The Quidditch season was
approaching, and O1iver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday
evening to discuss tactics for the new season.
There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by
putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of
the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black
balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal posts, and
the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged,
walnut-sized ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker’s team an extra one hundred
and fifty points.
Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts.
There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the
chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field.
“This is our last chance —my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup,” he told them, striding
up and down in front of them. “I’ll be leaving at the end of this year. I’ll never get another shot at it.
“Gryffindor hasn’t won for seven years now. Okay, so we’ve had the worst luck in the world —
injuries — then the tournament getting called off last year.” Wood swallowed, as though the
memory still brought a lump to his throat. “But we also know we’ve got the best — ruddy — team
— in — the — school,” he said, punching a fist into his other hand, the old manic glint back in his
eye. “We’ve got three superb Chasers.”
Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell.
“We’ve got two unbeatable Beaters.”
“Stop it, Oliver, you’re embarrassing us,” said Fred and George Weasley together, pretending to
blush.
“And we’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!” Wood rumbled, glaring at
Harry with a kind of furious pride. “And me,” he added as an afterthought.
“We think you’re very good too, Oliver,” said George.
“Spanking good Keeper,” said Fred.
“The point is,” Wood went on, resuming his pacing, “the Quidditch Cup should have had our
name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the team, I’ve thought the thing was in the
bag. But we haven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get to finally see our name on the
thing…”
Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic.
“Oliver, this year’s our year,” said Fred.
“We’ll do it, Oliver!” said Angelina.
“Definitely,” said Harry.
Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three evenings a week. The weather was
getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish
Harry’s wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.
Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training, cold and stiff but
pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the room buzzing excitedly.
“What’s happened?”, he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two of the best chairs by
the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy.
“First Hogsmeade weekend,” said Ron, pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered
old bulletin board. “End of October. Halloween.”
“Excellent,” said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait hole. “I need to visit
Zonko’s. I’m nearly out of Stink Pellets.”
Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing away. Hermione seemed to
read his mind.
“Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time,” she said. “They’re bound to catch Black soon.
He’s been sighted once already.”
“Black’s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,” said Ron. “Ask McGonagall if you can
go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages —”
“Ron!” said Hermione. “Harry’s supposed to stay in school —”
“He can’t be the only third year left behind,” said Ron. “Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry —”
“Yeah, I think I will,” said Harry, making up his mind.
Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her
lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.
“Does he have to eat that in front of us?” said Ron, scowling.
“Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?” said Hermione.
Crookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed insolently on Ron.
“Just keep him over there, that’s all,” said Ron irritably, turning back to his star chart. “I’ve got
Scabbers asleep in my bag.”
Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own star chart to complete. He
pulled his bag toward him, took out parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.
“You can copy mine, if you like,” said Ron, labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the
chart toward Harry.
Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn’t say anything. Crookshanks
was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he
pounced.
“Oi!” Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began
tearing ferociously. “GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!”
Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung on, spitting and
slashing.
“Ron, don’t hurt him!” squealed Hermione; the whole common room was watching; Ron
whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top —
“CATCH THAT CAT!” Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag,
sprang over the table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers.
George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty
pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low
on his bandy legs, and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw.
Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the middle and
heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with great difficulty, pulled Scabbers
out by the tail.
“Look at him!” he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front of her. “He’s skin and
bone! You keep that cat away from him!”
“Crookshanks doesn’t understand it’s wrong!” said Hermione, her voice shaking. “All cats chase
rats, Ron!”
“There’s something funny about that animal!” said Ron, who was trying to persuade a frantically
wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. “It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!”
“Oh, what rubbish,” said Hermione impatiently. “Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else
d’you think —”
“That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said Ron, ignoring the people around him, who were starting
to giggle. “And Scabbers was here first, and he’s ill!”
Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys’ dormitories.
Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to her all through
Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were working together on the same Puffapod.
“How’s Scabbers?” Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and
emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.
“He’s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,” said Ron angrily, missing the pail and scattering
beans over the greenhouse floor.
“Careful, Weasley, careful!” cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their
very eyes.
They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor McGonagall after the
lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest, joined the line outside the class trying to
decide how he was going to argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance at the front
of the line.
Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm around her and was explaining
something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were looking very serious.
“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join
the group.
“She got a letter from home this morning,” Parvati whispered. “It’s her rabbit, Binky. He’s been
killed by a fox.”
“Oh,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, Lavender.”
“I should have known!” said Lavender tragically. “You know what day it is?”
“Er —”
“The sixteenth of October! ‘That thing you’re dreading, it will happen on the sixteenth of
October!’ Remember? She was right, she was right!”
The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his head seriously. Hermione
hesitated; then she said, “You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?”
“Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender, looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes,
“but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn’t I?”
“Oh,” said Hermione. She paused again. Then —
“Was Binky an old rabbit?”
“N — no!” sobbed Lavender. “H — he was only a baby!”
Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender’s shoulders.
“But then, why would you dread him dying?” said Hermione.
Parvati glared at her.
“Well, look at it logically,” said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group. “I mean, Binky
didn’t even die today, did he? Lavender just got the news today —” Lavender wailed loudly. “– and
she can’t have been dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock —”
“Don’t mind Hermione, Lavender,” said Ron loudly, “she doesn’t think other people’s pets
matter very much.”
Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky;
Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated
themselves on either side of Harry and didn’t talk to each other for the whole class.
Harry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang
at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.
“One moment, please!” she called as the class made to leave. “As you’re all in my House, you
should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween. No form, no visiting the village,
so don’t forget!”
Neville put up his hand.
“Please, Professor, I — I think I’ve lost —”
“Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “She
seemed to think it was safer. Well, that’s all, you may leave.”
“Ask her now,” Ron hissed at Harry.
“Oh. but —” Hermione began.
“Go for it, Harry,” said Ron stubbornly.
Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed nervously for Professor
McGonagall’s desk.
“Yes, Potter?” Harry took a deep breath.
“Professor, my aunt and uncle — er — forgot to sign my form,” he said.
Professor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn’t say anything.
“So — er — d’you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I — if I go to
Hogsmeade?”
Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk.
“I’m afraid not, Potter,” she said. “You heard what I said. No form, no visiting the village. That’s
the rule.”
“But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know, they’re Muggles, they don’t really
understand about — about Hogwarts forms and stuff,” Harry said, while Ron egged him on with
vigorous nods. “If you said I could go —”
“But I don’t say so,” said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling her papers neatly into a
drawer. “The form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission.” She turned to
look at him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? “I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s my final
word. You had better hurry, or you’ll be late for your next lesson.”
There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of names that greatly
annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an ‘all-for-the-best’ expression that made Ron even angrier,
and Harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were
going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.
“There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry up. “You know, the Halloween
feast, in the evening.”
“Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.”
The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a
day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being
left behind. Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon’s
signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he hadn’t had it signed,
that was no good. Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that
one, reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the Dementors being able to see
through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort.
“They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be,”
he said seriously. “All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly
dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from that,
you’re not missing anything.”
On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast, feeling
thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to act normally.
“We’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,” said Hermione, looking desperately
sorry for him.
“Yeah, loads,” said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about
Crookshanks in the face of Harry’s difficulties.
“Don’t worry about me,” said Harry, in what he hoped was at, offhand voice, “I’ll see you at the
feast. Have a good time.”
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the
front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making
sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle.
“Scared of passing the Dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase, through the deserted
corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
“Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.
“Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly.
The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room. It was full of
chattering first-and second-years, and a few older students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so
often the novelty had worn off.
“Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!”
It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and never missed an
opportunity to speak to him.
“Aren’t you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey —” Colin looked eagerly around at his
friends — “you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!”
“Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said Harry, who wasn’t in the mood to have a lot of people staring
avidly at the scar on his forehead. “I — I’ve got to go to the library, got to get some work done.”
After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole
again.
“What was the point of waking me up?” the Fat Lady called grumpily after him as he walked
away.
Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he changed his mind; he
didn’t feel like working. He turned around and came face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just
seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors.
“What are you doing?” Filch snarled suspiciously.
“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully.
“Nothing!” spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. “A likely story! Sneaking around on your
own — why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms
like the rest of your nasty little friends?”
Harry shrugged.
“Well, get back to your common room where you belong!” snapped Filch, and he stood glaring
until Harry had passed out of sight.
But Harry didn’t go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of
visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside
one of the rooms said, “Harry?”
Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around his office
door.
“What are you doing?” said Lupin, though in a very different voice from Filch. “Where are Ron
and Hermione?”
“Hogsmeade,” said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.
“Ah,” said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. “Why don’t you come in? I’ve just taken
delivery of a Grindylow for our next lesson.”
“A what?” said Harry.
He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank of water. A sickly green
creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long,
spindly fingers.
“Water demon,” said Lupin, surveying the Grindylow thoughtfully. “We shouldn’t have much
difficulty with him, not after the Kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally
long fingers? Strong, but very brittle.”
The Grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner.
“Cup of tea?” Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. “I was just thinking of making one.”
“All right,” said Harry awkwardly.
Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout.
“Sit down,” said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. “I’ve only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I
daresay you’ve had enough of tea leaves?”
Harry looked at him. Lupin’s eyes were twinkling.
“How did you know about that?” Harry asked.
“Professor McGonagall told me,” said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug of tea. “You’re not
worried, are you?”
“No,” said Harry.
He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he’d seen in Magnolia Crescent but
decided not to. He didn’t want Lupin to think he was a coward, especially since Lupin already
seemed to think he couldn’t cope with a Boggart.
Something of Harry’s thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because Lupin said,
“Anything worrying you, Harry?”
“No,” Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the Grindylow brandishing a fist at him.
“Yes,” he said suddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin’s desk. “You know that day we fought the
Boggart?”
“Yes,” said Lupin slowly.
“Why didn’t you let me fight it?” said Harry abruptly.
Lupin raised his eyebrows.
“I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,” he said, sounding surprised.
Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he’d done any such thing, was taken aback.
“Why?” he said again.
“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that if the Boggart faced you, it would assume
the shape of Lord Voldemort.”
Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he’d expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort’s
name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor
Dumbledore.
“Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. “But I didn’t think it a good idea for
Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined that people would panic.”
“I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly. “I — I remembered those Dementors.”
“I see,” said Lupin thoughtfully. “Well, well…I’m impressed.” He smiled slightly at the look of
surprise on Harry’s face. “That suggests that what you fear most of all is — fear. Very wise, Harry.”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he drank some more tea.
“So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you capable of fighting the Boggart?” said Lupin
shrewdly.
“Well…yeah,” said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier. “Professor Lupin, you know
the Dementors —”
He was interrupted by a knock on the door.
“Come in,” called Lupin.
The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and
stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes narrowing.
“Ah, Severus,” said Lupin, smiling. “Thanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for
me?”
Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and Lupin.
“I was just showing Harry my Grindylow,” said Lupin pleasantly, pointing at the tank.
“Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it. “You should drink that directly, Lupin.”
“Yes, Yes, I will,” said Lupin.
“I made an entire cauldronful,” Snape continued. “If you need more.”
“I should probably have some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.”
“Not at all,” said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn’t like. He backed out of the
room, unsmiling and watchful.
Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.
“Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,” he said. “I have never been much
of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex.” He picked up the goblet and sniffed it.
“Pity sugar makes it useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering.
“Why —?” Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question.
“I’ve been feeling a bit off-color,” he said. “This potion is the only thing that helps. I am very
lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren’t many wizards who are up to making it.”
Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his
hands.
“Professor Snape’s very interested in the Dark Arts,” he blurted out.
“Really?” said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion.
“Some people reckon —” Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on, “some people reckon he’d
do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job.”
Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.
“Disgusting,” he said. “Well, Harry, I’d better get back to work. See you at the feast later.”
“Right,” said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.
The empty goblet was still smoking.
“There you go,” said Ron. “We got as much as we could carry.”
A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry’s lap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione
had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though
they’d had the time of their lives.
“Thanks,” said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps. “What’s Hogsmeade like?
Where did you go?”
By the sound of it — everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko’s
Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places
besides.
“The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, all color-coded
depending on how fast you want your letter to get there!”
“Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there’s a bit, look
—”
“We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks —”
“Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up —”
“What did you do?” said Hermione, looking anxious. “Did you get any work done?”
“No,” said Harry. “Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then Snape came in…”
He told them all about the goblet. Ron’s mouth fell open.
“Lupin drank it?” he gasped. “Is he mad?”
Hermione checked her watch.
“We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be starting in five minutes.” They hurried through
the portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing Snape.
“But if he — you know —” Hermione dropped her voice, glancing nervously around, “if he was
trying to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t have done it in front of Harry.”
“Yeah, maybe,” said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It
had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live
bats, and many flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like
brilliant watersnakes.
The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes
sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor
Lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to tiny little Professor
Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat.
Was he imagining it, or were Snape’s eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of
the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost,
had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good mood couldn’t even be spoiled by Malfoy,
who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, “The Dementors send their love, Potter!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to
Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady,
they found it jammed with students.
“Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously.
Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be closed.
“Let me through, please,” came Percy’s voice, and he came bustling importantly through the
crowd. “What’s the holdup here? You can’t all have forgotten the password — excuse me, I’m Head
Boy —”
And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down
the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, “Somebody get Professor
Dumbledore. Quick.”
People’s heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe.
“What’s going on?” said Ginny, who had just arrived.
A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors
squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the
trouble was.
“Oh, my —” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm.
The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so viciously that strips of
canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely. Dumbledore took one
quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin,
and Snape hurrying toward him.
“We need to find her,” said Dumbledore. “Professor McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once
and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.”
“You’ll be lucky!” said a cackling voice.
It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted, as he always did, at
the sight of wreckage or worry.
“What do you mean, Peeves?” said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves’s grin faded a little. He
didn’t dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle.
“Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn’t want to be seen. She’s a horrible mess. Saw her running
through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the trees. Crying something
dreadful,” he said happily. “Poor thing.” he added unconvincingly.
“Did she say who did it?” said Dumbledore quietly.
“Oh yes, Professorhead,” said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms.
“He got very angry when she wouldn’t let him in, you see.” Peeves flipped over and grinned at
Dumbledore from between his own legs. “Nasty temper he’s got, that Sirius Black.”
CHAPTER NINE
GRIM DEFEAT
Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall, where they were joined
ten minutes later by the students from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked
extremely confused.
“The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,” Professor Dumbledore told
them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all doors into the hall. “I’m afraid that, for your
own safety, you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand guard over the
entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be
reported to me immediately,” he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important.
“Send word with one of the ghosts.”
Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, “Oh, yes, you’ll be needing…”
One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood
themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy
purple sleeping bags.
“Sleep well,” said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him.
The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school
what had just happened.
“Everyone into their sleeping bags!” shouted Percy. “Come on, now, no more talking! Lights out
in ten minutes!”
“C’mon,” Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them
into a corner.
“Do you think Black’s still in the castle?” Hermione whispered anxiously.
“Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,” said Ron.
“It’s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,” said Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into
their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk. “The one night we weren’t in the
tower…”
“I reckon he’s lost track of time, being on the run,” said Ron. “Didn’t realize it was Halloween.
Otherwise he’d have come bursting in here.”
Hermione shuddered.
All around them, people were asking one another the same question: “How did he get in?”
“Maybe he knows how to Apparate,” said a Ravenclaw a few feet away, “Just appear out of thin
air, you know.”
“Disguised himself, probably,” said a Hufflepuff fifth year.
“He could’ve flown in,” suggested Dean Thomas.
“Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A History?” said
Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.
“Probably,” said Ron. “Why?”
“Because the castle’s protected by more than walls, you know,” said Hermione. “There are all
sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth. You can’t just Apparate in here. And
I’d like to see the disguise that could fool those Dementors. They’re guarding every single entrance
to the grounds. They’d have seen him fly in too. And Filch knows all the secret passages, they’ll have
them covered…”
“The lights are going out now!” Percy shouted. “I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no
more talking!”
The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the silvery ghosts, who were
drifting about talking seriously to the prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside,
was scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still filled the hall, Harry felt as
though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind.
Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the Hall to check that everything was quiet.
Around three in the morning, when many students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore
came in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping
bags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry, Ron, and
Hermione, who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore’s footsteps drew nearer.
“Any sign of him, Professor?” asked Percy in a whisper.
“No. All well here?”
“Everything under control, sir.”
“Good. There’s no point moving them all now. I’ve found a temporary guardian for the
Gryffindor portrait hole. You’ll be able to move them back in tomorrow.”
“And the Fat Lady, sir?”
“Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in
without the password, so he attacked. She’s still very distressed, but once she’s calmed down, I’ll
have Mr. Filch restore her.”
Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.
“Headmaster?” It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. “The whole of the third floor
has been searched. He’s not there. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either.”
“What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney’s room? The Owlery?”
“All searched…”
“Very well, Severus. I didn’t really expect Black to linger.”
“Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?” asked Snape.
Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear.
“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.”
Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledore’s back was
to him, but he could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and Snape’s profile, which looked angry.
“You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before — ah — the start of term?”
said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.
“I do, Severus,” said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning in his voice.
“It seems — almost impossible — that Black could have entered the school without inside help.
I did express my concerns when you appointed —”
“I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,” said
Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that Snape didn’t reply. “I
must go down to the Dementors,” said Dumbledore. “I said I would inform them when our search
was complete.”
“Didn’t they want to help, sir?” said Percy.
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore coldly. “But I’m afraid no Dementor will cross the threshold of this
castle while I am Headmaster.”
Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly and quietly. Snape
stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face;
then he too left.
Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes open too, reflecting
the starry ceiling.
“What was all that about?” Ron mouthed.
The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The theories about how he
had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of
their next Herbology class telling anyone who’d listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub.
The Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of Sir
Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time
challenging people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords, which he
changed at least twice a day.
“He’s a complete lunatic,” said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. “Can’t we get anyone else?”
“None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said Percy. “Frightened of what happened to the
Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer.”
Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry’s worries. He was now being closely watched.
Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry
suspected, on his mother’s orders) was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog.
To cap it all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such a somber expression
on her face Harry thought someone must have died.
“There’s no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,” she said in a very serious voice. “I
know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black —”
“I know he’s after me,” said Harry wearily. “I heard Ron’s dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley
works for the Ministry of Magic.”
Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a moment or two, then
said, “I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you’ll understand why I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to
be practicing Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only your team members, it’s very
exposed, Potter —”
“We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry, outraged. “I’ve got to train, Professor!”
Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply interested in the
Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d suggested him as Seeker in the first
Place. He waited, holding his breath.
“Hmm…”Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the Quidditch field,
just visible through the rain. “Well…goodness knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at last…but all
the same, Potter…I’d be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your
training sessions.”
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer. Undaunted, the
Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final
training session before Saturday’s match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.
“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking very angry. “Flint’s just been to see me.
We’re playing Hufflepuff instead.”
“Why?” chorused the rest of the team.
“Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still injured,” said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously.
“But it’s obvious why they’re doing it. Don’t want to play in this weather. Think it’ll damage their
chances…”
There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke, they heard a distant
rumble of thunder.
“There’s nothing wrong with Malfoy’s arm!” said Harry furiously. “He’s faking it!”
“I know that, but we can’t prove it,” said Wood bitterly, “And we’ve been practicing all those
moves assuming we’re playing Slytherin, and instead it’s Hufflepuff, and their style’s quite different.
They’ve got a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory —”
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.
“What?” said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.
“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said Angelina.
“Strong and silent,” said Katie, and they started to giggle again.
“He’s only silent because he’s too thick to string two words together,” said Fred impatiently. “I
don’t know why you’re worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry
caught the Snitch in about five minutes, remember?”
“We were playing in completely different conditions!” Wood shouted, his eyes bulging slightly.
“Diggory’s put a very strong side together! He’s an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you’d take it like
this! We mustn’t relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We must win!”
“Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. “We’re taking Hufflepuff very
seriously. Seriously.”
The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever. It
was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin
team was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.
“Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows.
Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow. Oliver
Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips. The third time this happened,
Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against
the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, “Diggory’s got a very fast swerve,
Harry, so you might want to try looping him —”
Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door
open, and dashed inside.
“Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin. I —”
But it wasn’t Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher’s desk; it was Snape.
“This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we’ll make it ten points from Gryffindor.
Sit down.”
But Harry didn’t move.
“Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said.
“He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said Snape with a twisted smile. “I believe I told you
to sit down?”
But Harry stayed where he was.
“What’s wrong with him?”
Snape’s black eyes glittered.
“Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though he wished it were. “Five more points from
Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.”
Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the class.
“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics
you have covered so far —”
“Please, sir, we’ve done Boggarts, Red Caps, Kappas, and Grindylows,” said Hermione quickly,
“and we’re just about to start —”
“Be quiet,” said Snape coldly. “I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on
Professor Lupin’s lack of organization.”
“He’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever had,” said Dean Thomas boldly,
and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than
ever.
“You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you — I would expect first years to be able to
deal with Red Caps and Grindylows. Today we shall discuss —”
Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, which he must know
they hadn’t covered.
“— werewolves,” said Snape.
“But, sir,” said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, “we’re not supposed to do
werewolves yet, we’re due to start Hinkypunks —”
“Miss Granger,” said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, “I was under the impression that I am
teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394.” He glanced around
again. “All of you! Now!”
With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class opened their books.
“Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf?” said
Snape.
Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did,
had shot straight into the air.
“Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back. “Are you telling me that
Professor Lupin hasn’t even taught you the basic distinction between —”
“We told you,” said Parvati suddenly, “we haven’t got as far as werewolves yet, we’re still on--”
“Silence!” snarled Snape. “Well, well, well, I never thought I’d meet a third-year class who
wouldn’t even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor
Dumbledore how very behind you all are…”
“Please, sir,” said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, “the werewolf differs from the true
wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf —”
“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five
more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”
Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It
was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one
of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a
know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, “You asked us a question and she knows the answer!
Why ask if you don’t want to be told?”
The class knew instantly he’d gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its
breath.
“Detention, Weasley,” Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron’s. “And if I ever hear you
criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.”
No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves
from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work they
had been doing with Professor Lupin.
“Very poorly explained…That is incorrect, the Kappa is more commonly found in
Mongolia…Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn’t have given it three…”
When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.
“You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill
werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It
is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.”
Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until they were well out
of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape.
“Snape’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even
if he did want the job,” Harry said to Hermione. “Why’s he got it in for Lupin? D’you think this is
all because of the Boggart?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione pensively. “But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon…”
Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage.
“D’you know what that —” (he called Snape something that made Hermione say “Ron!”) “— is
making me do? I’ve got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magic!” He was
breathing deeply, his fists clenched. “Why couldn’t Black have hidden in Snape’s office, eh? He
could have finished him off for us!”
Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was still dark. For a moment he
thought the roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck
and sat bolt upright — Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in his ear.
“What did you do that for?” said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and
zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.
Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he
rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore
the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and
the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the
Quidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got up,
dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory.
As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent down just in time to grab
Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside.
“You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously. “There
are plenty of mice around this place — go and chase them. Go on,” he added, nudging Crookshanks
down the spiral staircase with his foot. “Leave Scabbers alone.”
The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room. Harry knew better than to think
the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren’t called off for trifles like thunderstorms.
Nevertheless, he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to
him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry. Seekers were usually light
and speedy, but Diggory’s weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to
be blown off course.
Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up every now and then to
stop Crookshanks from sneaking up the boys’ staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be
time for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.
“Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned.
He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he’d started on toast, the rest of
the team had turned up.
“It’s going to be a tough one,” said Wood, who wasn’t eating anything.
“Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we don’t mind a bit of rain.”
But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the
whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the
Quidditch field, heads bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their
hands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,
laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.
The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood’s usual pre-match pep talk, but
it didn’t come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head
hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him.
The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field. If the
crowd was cheering, they couldn’t hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over
Harry’s glasses. How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?
The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field, wearing canary-yellow
robes. The Captains walked up to each other and shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood
now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch’s mouth form
the words, “Mount Your brooms.” He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and
swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a
blast that sounded shrill and distant — they were off.
Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He held it as steady as he
could and turned, squinting into the rain.
Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able to see his teammates,
let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow
shapes, with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn’t hear the
commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas.
Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain
on his glasses he hadn’t seen them coming.
He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight. The sky was
getting darker, as though night had decided to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player,
without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so
thick, he could hardly tell them apart…
With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch’s whistle; Harry could just see
the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed
down into the mud.
“I called for time-out!” Wood roared at his team. “Come on, under here —”
They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and
wiped them hurriedly on his robes.
“What’s the score?”
“We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get the Snitch soon, we’ll be playing into the
night.”
“I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said exasperatedly, waving his glasses.
At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her
head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
“I’ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!”
He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione tapped them with
her wand and said, “Impervius!”
“There!” she said, handing them back to Harry. “They’ll repel water!”
Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.
“Brilliant!” he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd. “Okay, team, let’s go
for it!”
Hermione’s spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold, still wetter than he’d ever
been in his life, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he urged his broom through the
turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory,
who was streaking in the opposite direction…
There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning. This was getting
more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly —
He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at that moment, another
flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw something that distracted him completely,
the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky, motionless in the
topmost, empty row of seats.
Harry’s numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking
his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished.
“Harry!” came Wood’s anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts. “Harry, behind you!”
Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold
was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them…
With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broom handle and zoomed toward the
Snitch.
“Come on!” he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face. “Faster!”
But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the stadium. The wind,
though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound,
as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on?
And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him, just as he became aware of
something moving on the field below…
Before he’d had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down.
At least a hundred Dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath
him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he
heard it again…Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head…a woman…
“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”
“Stand aside, you silly girl…stand aside, now…”
“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead —”
Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry’s brain…What was he doing? Why was he
flying? He needed to help her…She was going to die…She was going to be murdered…
He was falling, falling through the icy mist.
“Not Harry! Please…have mercy…have mercy…”
A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no more.
“Lucky the ground was so soft.”
“I thought he was dead for sure.”
“But he didn’t even break his glasses.”
Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever. He didn’t have a
clue where he was, or how he’d got there, or what he’d been doing before he got there. All he knew
was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.
“That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Scariest…the scariest thing…hooded black figures…cold…screaming…
Harry’s eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team,
spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also
there, looking as though they’d just climbed out of a swimming pool.
“Harry!” said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud. “How’re you feeling?”
It was as though Harry’s memory was on fast forward. The lightning…the Grim…the
Snitch…and the Dementors…
“What happened?” he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.
“You fell off,” said Fred. “Must’ve been — what — fifty feet?”
“We thought you’d died,” said Alicia, who was shaking.
Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot.
“But the match,” said Harry. “What happened? Are we doing a replay?”
No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.
“We didn’t — lose?”
“Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you fell. He didn’t realize what had happened.
When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they
won fair and square…even Wood admits it.”
“Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn’t there.
“Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he’s trying to drown himself.”
Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook
it roughly.
“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch before.”
“There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said George.
“It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred points.”
“Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin…”
“Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,” said George.
“But if they beat Ravenclaw…”
“No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff…”
“It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way —”
Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost…for the first time ever, he had lost a
Quidditch match.
After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace.
“We’ll come and see you later,” Fred told him. “Don’t beat yourself up Harry, you’re still the
best Seeker we’ve ever had.”
The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them,
looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry’s bed.
“Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a quaking voice. “I’ve never seen him like that
before. He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you
hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the Dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the
stadium right away…He was furious they’d come onto the grounds. We heard him —”
“Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,” said Ron. “And walked up to school with you floating
on it. Everyone thought you were…”
His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the Dementors had
done to him…about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione looking at him
so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.
“Did someone get my Nimbus?”
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.
“Er —”
“What?” said Harry, looking from one to the other.
“Well…when you fell off, it got blown away,” said Hermione hesitantly.
“And?”
“And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow.”
Harry’s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the
middle of the grounds.
“And?” he said, dreading the answer.
“Well, you know the Whomping Willow,” said Ron. “It — it doesn’t like being hit.”
“Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around,” said Hermione in a very small
voice.
Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of
splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry’s faithful, finally beaten
broomstick.
CHAPTER TEN
THE MARAUDER’S MAP
Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He
didn’t argue or complain, but he wouldn’t let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus
Two Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry
couldn’t help it; he felt as though he’d lost one of his best friends.
He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy
flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a
get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of
fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who
told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn’t blame him in the slightest. Ron and
Hermione left Harry’s bedside only at night. But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel
any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him.
He hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron and Hermione, because he knew Ron
would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared
twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly
been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the Grim
going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his
shoulder for the beast?
And then there were the Dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of
them. Everyone said the Dementors were horrible, but no one else collapsed every time they went
near one. No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.
Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard
them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at
the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the Dementors approached him, he heard the last
moments of his mother’s life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and
Voldemort’s laughter before he murdered her…Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of
clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother’s voice.
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was
forced to think about other things, even if he had to endure Draco Malfoy’s taunting. Malfoy was
almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor’s defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and
celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his
broom. Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing Dementor imitations across the
dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in
the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor.
“If Snape’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I’m skiving off,” said Ron as they
headed toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch. “Check who’s in there, Hermione.”
Hermione peered around the classroom door.
“It’s okay!”
Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had been ill. His old robes
were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he
smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints
about Snape’s behavior while Lupin had been ill.
“It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?”
“We don’t know anything about werewolves —”
“— two rolls of parchment!”
“Did you tell Professor Snape we haven’t covered them yet?” Lupin asked, frowning slightly.
The babble broke out again.
“Yes, but he said we were really behind —”
“— he wouldn’t listen —”
“— two rolls of parchment!”
Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.
“Don’t worry. I’ll speak to Professor Snape. You don’t have to do the essay.”
“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking very disappointed. “I’ve already finished it!”
They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a
Hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke,
rather frail and harmless looking.
“Lures travelers into bogs,” said Professor Lupin as they took notes. “You notice the lantern
dangling from his hand? Hops ahead — people follow the light — then —”
The Hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.
When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, Harry among
them, but —
“Wait a moment, Harry,” Lupin called. “I’d like a word.”
Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the Hinkypunk’s box with a cloth.
“I heard about the match,” said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into
his briefcase, “and I’m sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?”
“No,” said Harry. “The tree smashed it to bits.”
Lupin sighed.
“They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to
play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon
nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance.”
“Did you hear about the Dementors too?” said Harry with difficulty.
Lupin looked at him quickly.
“Yes, I did. I don’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been
growing restless for some time…furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds…I suppose they
were the reason you fell?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he
could stop himself. “Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just —?”
“It has nothing to do with weakness,” said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read
Harry’s mind. “The Dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your
past that the others don’t have.”
A ray of wintry sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating Lupin’s gray hairs and the lines on
his young face.
“Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest
places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around
them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t see them. Get too near a Dementor and
every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed
on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself — soul-less and evil. You’ll be left with
nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that happened to you, Harry, is
enough to make anyone fall off their broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.”
“When they get near me —” Harry stared at Lupin’s desk, his throat tight. “I can hear
Voldemort murdering my mum.”
Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry’s shoulder, but thought
better of it. There was a moment’s silence, then —
“Why did they have to come to the match?” said Harry bitterly.
“They’re getting hungry,” said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap. “Dumbledore
won’t let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up…I don’t think they
could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement…emotions running
high…it was their idea of a feast.”
“Azkaban must be terrible,” Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.
“The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don’t need walls and water to keep
the prisoners in, not when they’re all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery
thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.”
“But Sirius Black escaped from them,” Harry said slowly. “He got away…”
Lupin’s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it.
“Yes,” he said, straightening up, “Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn’t have
believed it possible…Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them
too long…”
“You made that Dementor on the train back off,” said Harry suddenly.
“There are — certain defenses one can use,” said Lupin. “But there was only one Dementor on
the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist.”
“What defenses?” said Harry at once. “Can you teach me?”
“I don’t pretend to be an expert at fighting Dementors, Harry — quite the contrary…”
“But if the Dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able to fight them —”
Lupin looked into Harry’s determined face, hesitated, then said, “Well…all right. I’ll try and
help. But it’ll have to wait until next term, I’m afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a
very inconvenient time to fall ill.”
What with the promise of anti-Dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought that he might never
have to hear his mother’s death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their
Quidditch match at the end of November, Harry’s mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were
not out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match. Wood became
repossessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that
persisted into December. Harry saw no hint of a Dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore’s anger
seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances.
Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white
and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle,
there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had already
decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The
students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had
decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn’t stand two weeks
with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn’t fooled; they were
doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful.
To everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last
weekend of the term.
“We can do all our Christmas shopping there!” said Hermione. “Mum and Dad would really
love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!”
Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a
copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different
makes. He had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star,
which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his own.
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron and Hermione,
who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back
toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still
and quiet.
“Psst — Harry!”
He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and George peering out at him
from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch.
“What are you doing?” said Harry curiously. “How come you’re not going to Hogsmeade?”
“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,” said Fred, with a mysterious wink.
“Come in here…”
He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred
and George inside. George closed the door quietly and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.
“Early Christmas present for you, Harry,” he said.
Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It
was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one
of Fred and George’s jokes, stared at it.
“What’s that supposed to be?”
“This, Harry, is the secret of our success,” said George, patting the parchment fondly.
“It’s a wrench, giving it to you,” said Fred, “but we decided last night, your need’s greater than
ours.”
“Anyway, we know it by heart,” said George. “We bequeath it to you. We don’t really need it
anymore.”
“And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?” said Harry.
“A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had
mortally offended him. “Explain, George.”
“Well…when we were in our first year, Harry — young, carefree, and innocent —”
Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been innocent.
“— well, more innocent than we are now — we got into a spot of bother with Filch.”
“We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason —”
“So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual —”
“— detention —”
“— disembowelment —”
“— and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and
Highly Dangerous.”
“Don’t tell me —” said Harry, starting to grin.
“Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred. “George caused a diversion by dropping another
Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed — his.”
“It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know,” said George. “We don’t reckon Filch ever found out
how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn’t have confiscated it.”
“And you know how to work it?”
“Oh yes,” said Fred, smirking. “This little beauty’s taught us more than all the teachers in this
school.”
“You’re winding me up,” said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of parchment.
“Oh, are we?” said George.
He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, “I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good.”
And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider’s web from the point that George’s wand
had touched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the
parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:
Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs
Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present
THE MARAUDER’S MAP
It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable
thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing.
Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor
Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor;
and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry’s eyes
traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead —
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. “There are seven in all.
Now, Filch knows about these four” — he pointed them out — “but we’re sure we’re the only ones
who know about these. Don’t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it
until last winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And we don’t reckon anyone’s ever used
this one, because the Whomping Willow’s planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this
one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We’ve used it loads of times. And as you might’ve
noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone’s hump.”
“Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,” sighed George, patting the heading of the map. “We
owe them so much.”
“Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,” said Fred solemnly.
“Right,” said George briskly. “Don’t forget to wipe it after you’ve used it —”
“— or anyone can read it,” Fred said warningly.
“Just tap it again and say, ‘Mischief managed!’ And it’ll go blank.”
“So, young Harry,” said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, “mind you behave
yourself.”
“See you in Honeydukes,” said George, winking.
They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.
Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left
and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn’t know…he wouldn’t have to pass
the Dementors at all…
But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr.
Weasley say came floating out of his memory.
Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can’t see where it keeps its brain.
This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning
against…Aids for Magical Mischief Makers…but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to
get into Hogsmeade, it wasn’t as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone…and Fred
and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening…
Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.
Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his
robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one
outside. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch.
What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment, that a new
ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled ‘Harry Potter’. This figure was standing exactly where the
real Harry was standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor. Harry watched carefully. His
little Ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real
wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The tiniest speech
bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside said, ‘Dissendium.’
“Dissendium!” Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.
At once, the statue’s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced
quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole
headfirst, and pushed himself forward.
He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth.
He stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, “Lumos!” and saw
that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his
wand, and muttered, “Mischief managed!” The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully,
tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.
The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry
hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.
It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an
hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.
Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above
him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he
lost count as he climbed, watching his feet…then, without warning, his head hit something hard.
It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening. He
couldn’t hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the
edge.
He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry climbed out of the trapdoor
and replaced it — it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was
there. Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could definitely hear
voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door.
Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody
was about to come downstairs.
“And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they’ve nearly cleaned us out —” said a woman’s voice.
A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited
for the footsteps to pass. He heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not
get another chance —
Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking
back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at
the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes — he
ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.
Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry. He
edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would
spread over Dudley’s piggy face if he could see where Harry was now.
There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy
chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of
different kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another
of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbet balls that Ron had mentioned; along yet another wall
were ‘Special Effects’ — sweets: Droobles Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-
colored bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny
black Pepper Imps (‘breathe fire for your friends!’), Ice Mice (‘hear your teeth chatter and squeak!’),
peppermint creams shaped like toads (‘hop realistically in the stomach!’), fragile sugar-spun quills,
and exploding bonbons.
Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest
corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione were standing underneath it,
examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.
“Ugh, no, Harry won’t want one of those, they’re for vampires, I expect,” Hermione was saying.
“How about these?” said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under Hermione’s nose.
“Definitely not,” said Harry.
Ron nearly dropped the jar.
“Harry!” squealed Hermione. “What are you doing here? How — how did you —?”
“Wow!” said Ron, looking very impressed, “you’ve learned to Apparate!”
“‘Course I haven’t,” said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear
him and told them all about the Marauder’s Map.
“How come Fred and George never gave it tome!” said Ron, outraged. “I’m their brother!”
“But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as though the idea were ludicrous. “He’s
going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you, Harry?”
“No, I’m not!” said Harry.
“Are you mad?” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “Hand in something that good?”
“If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and George had nicked it!”
“But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He could be using one of the passages on that
map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to know!”
“He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry quickly. “There are seven secret tunnels
on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them. And of the
other three — one of them’s caved in, so no one can get through it. One of them’s got the
Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can’t get out of it. And the one I just came
through — well — it’s really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar — so unless he knew it
was there —”
Harry hesitated. What if Black did know the passage was there? Ron, however, cleared his throat
significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.
BY ORDER OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Customers are reminded that until further notice, Dementors will be patrolling the streets of
Hogsmeade every night after sundown. This measure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade
residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is therefore advisable that you complete
your shopping well before nightfall.
Merry Christmas!
“See?” said Ron quietly. “I’d like to see Black try and break into Honeydukes with Dementors
swarming all over the village. Anyway, Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in,
wouldn’t they? They live over the shop!”
“Yes, but — but —” Heroine seemed to be struggling to find another problem. “Look, Harry
still shouldn’t be coming into Hogsmeade. He hasn’t got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he’ll be
in so much trouble! And it’s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns up today? Now?”
“He’d have a job spotting Harry in this,” said Ron, nodding through the mullioned windows at
the thick, swirling snow. “Come on, Hermione, it’s Christmas. Harry deserves a break.”
Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.
“Are you going to report me?” Harry asked her, grinning.
“Oh — of course not — but honestly, Harry —”
“Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?” said Ron, grabbing him and leading him over to their
barrel. “And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it
burnt a hole right through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick.” Ron
stared broodingly into the Acid Pop box. “Reckon Fred’d take a bite of Cockroach Cluster if I told
him they were peanuts?”
When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them left Honeydukes for
the blizzard outside.
Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered
in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles
hanging in the trees.
Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn’t have his cloak. They headed up the street, heads
bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting through their scarves.
“That’s the post office —”
“Zonko’s is up there —”
“We could go up to the Shrieking Shack —”
“Tell you what,” said Ron, his teeth chattering, “shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three
Broomsticks?”
Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing, so they crossed
the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.
It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of woman with a pretty face
was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar.
“That’s Madam Rosmerta,” said Ron. “I’ll get the drinks, shall I?” he added, going slightly red.
Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, where there was a small, vacant
table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron
came back five minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.
“Merry Christmas!” he said happily, raising his tankard.
Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he’d ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit
of him from the inside.
A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had opened again. Harry
looked over the rim of his tankard and choked.
Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly
followed by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and
a pinstriped cloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of Harry’s head and forced
him off his stool and under the table. Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry
clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers’ and Fudge’s feet move toward the bar, pause,
then turn and walk right toward him.
Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, “Mobiliarbus!”
The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground, drifted sideways, and
landed with a soft thump right in front of their table, hiding them from view. Staring through the
dense lower branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs,
then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down.
Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, and heard a woman’s
voice.
“A small gillywater —”
“Mine,” said Professor McGonagall’s voice.
“Four pints of mulled mead —”
“Ta, Rosmerta,” said Hagrid.
“A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella —”
“Mmm!” said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.
“So you’ll be the red currant rum, Minister.”
“Thank you, Rosmerta, m’dear,” said Fudge’s voice. “Lovely to see you again, I must say. Have
one yourself, won’t you? Come and join us…”
“Well, thank you very much, Minister.”
Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart was pounding
uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn’t it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term
for the teachers too? And how long were they going to sit there? He needed time to sneak back into
Honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight…Hermione’s leg gave a nervous twitch next to
him.
“So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?” came Madam Rosmerta’s voice.
Harry saw the lower part of Fudge’s thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for
eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, “What else, m’dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you
heard what happened up at the school at Halloween?”
“I did hear a rumor,” admitted Madam Rosmerta.
“Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly.
“Do you think Black’s still in the area, Minister?” whispered Madam Rosmerta.
“I’m sure of it,” said Fudge shortly.
“You know that the Dementors have searched the whole village twice?” said Madam Rosmerta, a
slight edge to her voice. “Scared all my customers away…It’s very bad for business, Minister.”
“Rosmerta, dear, I don’t like them any more than you do,” said Fudge uncomfortably.
“Necessary precaution…unfortunate, but there you are…I’ve just met some of them. They’re in a
fury against Dumbledore — he won’t let them inside the castle grounds.”
“I should think not,” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “How are we supposed to teach with
those horrors floating around?”
“Hear, hear!” squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground.
“All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to protect you all from something much
worse…We all know what Black’s capable of…”
“Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,” said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. “Of all the
people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I’d have thought…I mean, I remember
him when he was a boy at Hogwarts. If you’d told me then what he was going to become, I’d have
said you’d had too much mead.”
“You don’t know the half of it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge gruffly. “The worst he did isn’t widely
known.”
“The worst?” said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity. “Worse than murdering all
those poor people, you mean?”
“I certainly do,” said Fudge.
“I can’t believe that. What could possibly be worse?”
“You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor McGonagall. “Do
you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one without the other, did
you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the
double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both
very bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact — but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair
of troublemakers —”
“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give ‘em a run fer their money.”
“You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor Flitwick.
“Inseparable!”
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing
changed when they left school. Black was best man when James married Lily. Then they named him
godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment
him.”
“Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?” whispered Madam Rosmerta.
“Worse even than that, m’dear…” Fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low
rumble. “Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them.
Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful
spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised them to go
into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn’t an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told
them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.”
“How does that work?” said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick
cleared his throat.
“An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily, “involving the magical concealment of a secret
inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper,
and is henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As
long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and
James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their
sitting room window!”
“So Black was the Potters’ Secret-Keeper?” whispered Madam Rosmerta.
“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die
rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself…and yet,
Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters’ Secret-Keeper himself.”
“He suspected Black?” gasped Madam Rosmerta.
“He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-Know-Who informed of
their movements,” said Professor McGonagall darkly. “Indeed, he had suspected for some time that
someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.”
“But James Potter insisted on using Black?”
“He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been
performed —”
“Black betrayed them?” breathed Madam Rosmerta.
“He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support
openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters’
death. But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone,
horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His master had fallen
at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to
run for it —”
“Filthy, stinkin’ turncoat!” Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet.
“Shh!” said Professor McGonagall.
“I met him!” growled Hagrid. “I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people!
It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an’ James’s house after they was killed! Jus’ got him outta
the ruins, poor little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an’ his parents dead…an’ Sirius
Black turns up, on that flyin’ motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin’
there. I didn’ know he’d bin Lily an’ James’s Secret-Keeper. Thought he’d jus’ heard the news o’
You-Know-Who’s attack an’ come ter see what he could do. White an’ shakin’, he was. An’ yeh
know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN’ TRAITOR!” Hagrid roared.
“Hagrid, please!” said Professor McGonagall. “Keep your voice down!”
“How was I ter know he wasn’ upset abou’ Lily an’ James? It was You-Know-Who he cared
abou’! An’ then he says, ‘Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I’m his godfather, I’ll look after him —’ Ha!
But I’d had me orders from Dumbledore, an’ I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter
his aunt an’ uncle’s. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get
Harry there. ‘I won’t need it anymore,’ he says.
“I shoulda known there was somethin’ fishy goin’ on then. He loved that motorbike, what was
he givin’ it ter me for? Why wouldn’ he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace.
Dumbledore knew he’d bin the Potters’ Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin’ ter have ter run fer
it that night, knew it was a matter o’ hours before the Ministry was after him.
“But what if I’d given Harry to him, eh? I bet he’d’ve pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea.
His bes’ friends’ son! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side, there’s nothin’ and no one that
matters to em anymore…”
A long silence followed Hagrid’s story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with some satisfaction, “But
he didn’t manage to disappear, did he? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!”
“Alas, if only we had,” said Fudge bitterly. “It was not we who found him. It was little Peter
Pettigrew — another of the Potters’ friends. Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black
had been the Potters’ Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.”
“Pettigrew…that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts?” said
Madam Rosmerta.
“Hero — worshipped Black and Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “Never quite in their
league, talent-wise. I was often rather sharp with him. You can imagine how I — how I regret that
now…” She sounded as though she had a sudden head cold.
“There, now, Minerva,” said Fudge kindly, “Pettigrew died a hero’s death. Eyewitnesses —
Muggles, of course, we wiped their memories later — told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They
say he was sobbing, ‘Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?’ And then he went for his wand. Well,
of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens…”
Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, “Stupid boy…foolish boy…he was always
hopeless at dueling…should have left it to the Ministry…”
“I tell yeh, if I’d got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I wouldn’t’ve messed around with
wands — I’d ‘ve ripped him limb — from — limb,” Hagrid growled.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Hagrid,” said Fudge sharply. “Nobody but trained
Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black
once he was cornered. I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time,
and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those people. I — I will never forget
it. I still dream about it sometimes. A crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the
sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with what
was left of Pettigrew in front of him…a heap of bloodstained robes and a few — a few fragments —”
Fudge’s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being blown.
“Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge thickly. “Black was taken away by twenty
members of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First
Class, which I think was some comfort to his poor mother. Black’s been in Azkaban ever since.”
Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.
“Is it true he’s mad, Minister?”
“I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly. “I certainly believe his master’s defeat
unhinged him for a while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a
cornered and desperate man — cruel…pointless. Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban.
You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there’s no sense in
them…but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me. It was
unnerving. You’d have thought he was merely bored — asked if I’d finished with my newspaper,
cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the
Dementors seemed to be having on him — and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place,
you know. Dementors outside his door day and night.”
“But what do you think he’s broken out to do?” said Madam Rosmerta. “Good gracious,
Minister, he isn’t trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?”
“I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan,” said Fudge evasively. “But we hope to catch Black
long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing…but give him back
his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he’ll rise again…”
There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their glass.
“You know, Cornelius, if you’re dining with the headmaster, we’d better head back up to the
castle,” said Professor McGonagall.
One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their owners once more; hems
of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam Rosmerta’s glittering heels disappeared behind the bar. The
door of the Three Broomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and the teachers had
disappeared.
“Harry?”
Ron’s and Hermione’s faces appeared under the table. They were both staring at him, lost for
words.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
THE FIREBOLT
Harry didn’t have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the Honeydukes
cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once more. All he knew was that the return trip
seemed to take no time at all, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head was
still pounding with the conversation he had just heard.
Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley, Cornelius Fudge…why
hadn’t anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry’s parents had died because their best friend had
betrayed them?
Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all through dinner, not daring to talk about what
they’d overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded
common room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end-
of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn’t want Fred and George asking him whether he’d reached
Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside
cabinet. He pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for — the leather-bound
photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his mother
and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages,
searching, until…
He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day. There was his father waving up at him,
beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in all directions. There was his
mother, alight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there…that must be him. Their best
man…Harry had never given him a thought before.
If he hadn’t known it was the same person, he would never have guessed it was Black in this old
photograph. His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been
working for Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the
two people next to him? Did he realize he was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that
would make him unrecognizable?
But the Dementors don’t affect him, Harry thought, staring into the handsome, laughing face.
He doesn’t have to hear my Mum screaming if they get too close —
Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his
robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings were hiding him from view.
The dormitory door opened.
“Harry?” said Ron’s voice uncertainly.
But Harry lay still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and rolled over on his
back, his eyes wide open.
A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry like poison. He could
see Black laughing at him through the darkness, as though somebody had pasted the picture from
the album over his eyes. He watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius
Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. He
could hear (though having no idea what Black’s voice might sound like) a low, excited mutter. “It
has happened, My Lord…the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper” and then came another
voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head whenever the Dementors
drew near…
“Harry, you — you look terrible.”
Harry hadn’t gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to find the dormitory deserted,
dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for
Ron, who was eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and Hermione, who had
spread her homework over three tables.
“Where is everyone?” said Harry.
“Gone! It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?” said Ron, watching Harry closely. “It’s
nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute.”
Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling outside the windows.
Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large, ginger rug.
“You really don’t look well, you know,” Hermione said, peering anxiously into his face.
“I’m fine,” said Harry.
“Harry, listen,” said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, “you must be really upset about
what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn’t go doing anything stupid.”
“Like what?” said Harry.
“Like trying to go after Black,” said Ron sharply.
Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep. He didn’t say
anything.
“You won’t, will you, Harry?” said Hermione.
“Because Black’s not worth dying for,” said Ron.
Harry looked at them. They didn’t seem to understand at all.
“D’you know what I see and hear every time a Dementor gets too near me?” Ron and Hermione
shook their heads, looking apprehensive. “I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with
Voldemort. And if you’d heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn’t
forget it in a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed
her and sent Voldemort after her —”
“There’s nothing you can do!” said Hermione, looking stricken. “The Dementors will catch
Black and he’ll go back to Azkaban and — and serve him right!”
“You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t affected by Azkaban like normal people are. It’s not a
punishment for him like it is for the others.”
“So what are you saying?” said Ron, looking very tense. “You want to — to kill Black or
something?”
“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione in a panicky voice. “Harry doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you,
Harry?”
Again, Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t know what he wanted to do. All he knew was that the
idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than he could stand.
“Malfoy knows,” he said abruptly. “Remember what he said to me in Potions? ‘If it was me, I’d
hunt him down myself…I’d want revenge.’”
“You’re going to take Malfoy’s advice instead of ours?” said Ron furiously. “Listen…you know
what Pettigrew’s mother got back after Black had finished with him? Dad told me — the Order of
Merlin, First Class, and Pettigrew’s finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him they could find.
Black’s a madman, Harry, and he’s dangerous —”
“Malfoy’s dad must have told him,” said Harry, ignoring Ron. “He was right in Voldemort’s
inner circle —”
“Say You-Know-Who, will you?” interjected Ron angrily.
“— so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort —”
“— and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip.
Malfoy’s just hoping you’ll get yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch.”
“Harry, please,” said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, “Please be sensible. Black did a
terrible, terrible thing, but d-don’t put yourself in danger, it’s what Black wants…Oh, Harry, you’d
be playing right into Black’s hands if you went looking for him. Your mum and dad wouldn’t want
you to get hurt, would they? They’d never want you to go looking for Black!”
“I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because thanks to Black, I’ve never spoken to them,”
said Harry shortly.
There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws. Ron’s pocket
quivered.
“Look,” said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject, “it’s the holidays! It’s nearly
Christmas! Let’s — let’s go down and see Hagrid. We haven’t visited him for ages!”
“No!” said Hermione quickly. “Harry isn’t supposed to leave the castle, Ron —”
“Yeah, let’s go,” said Harry, sitting up, “and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black
when he told me all about my parents!”
Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn’t what Ron had had in mind.
“Or we could have a game of chess,” he said hastily, “or Gobstones. Percy left a set —”
“No, let’s visit Hagrid,” said Harry firmly.
So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole (“Stand and
fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!”), down through the empty castle and out through the oak front
doors.
They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the glittering, powdery
snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as
though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid’s cabin looked like an
iced cake.
Ron knocked, but there was no answer.
“He’s not out, is he?” said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.
Ron had his ear to the door.
“There’s a weird noise,” he said. “Listen — is that Fang?”
Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin came a series of low,
throbbing moans.
“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron nervously.
“Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door. “Hagrid, are you in there?”
There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid stood there with his
eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the front of his leather vest.
“You’ve heard?” he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry’s neck.
Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no laughing matter. Harry, about
to collapse under Hagrid’s weight, was rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid
under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair
and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with tears that dripped down
into his tangled beard.
“Hagrid, what is it?” said Hermione, aghast.
Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.
“What’s this, Hagrid?”
Hagrid’s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who picked it up and read
aloud:
Dear Mr. Hagrid,
Further to our inquiry into the attack by a Hippogriff on a student in your class, we have accepted the
assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.
“Well, that’s okay then, Hagrid!” said Ron, clapping Hagrid on the shoulder. But Hagrid
continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to read on.
However, we must register our concern about the Hippogriff in question. We have decided to uphold
the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for
the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April 20th, and we ask you to present
yourself and your Hippogriff at the Committee’s offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the
Hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated.
Yours in fellowship…
There followed a list of the school governors.
“Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad Hippogriff, Hagrid. I bet he’ll get off.”
“Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures!”
choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. “They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!”
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid’s cabin made Harry, Ron, and Hermione whip
around. Buckbeak the Hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing
blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on his own! At
Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid
about what he called ‘interesting creatures’ and other people called ‘terrifying monsters.’ On the
other hand, there didn’t seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual
standards, he was positively cute.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione, sitting down and laying a
hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.”
“Won’ make no diff’rence!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them Disposal devils, they’re all in Lucius
Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! Ad if I lose the case, Buckbeak —”
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and lurched forward, his
face in his arms.
“What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?” said Harry.
“He’s done more’n enough fer me already,” groaned Hagrid. “Got enough on his plate what
with keepin’ them Dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black lurkin’ around.”
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to start berating Hagrid
for not telling him the truth about Black. But Harry couldn’t bring himself to do it, not now that he
saw Hagrid so miserable and scared.
“Listen, Hagrid,” he said, “you can’t give up. Hermione’s right, you just need a good defense.
You can call us as witnesses —”
“I’m sure I’ve read about a case of Hippogriff-baiting,” said Hermione thoughtfully, “where the
Hippogriff got off. I’ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened.”
Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to help them.
“Er — shall I make a cup of tea?” said Ron.
Harry stared at him.
“It’s what my mum does whenever someone’s upset,” Ron muttered, shrugging.
At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea in front of him, Hagrid
blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said, “Yer right. I can’ afford to go ter
pieces. Gotta pull meself together…”
Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on Hagrid’s knee.
“I’ve not bin meself lately,” said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with
the other. “Worried abou’ Buckbeak, an’ no one likin’ me classes —”
“We do like them!” lied Hermione at once.
“Yeah, they’re great!” said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table. “Er — how are the
flobberworms?”
“Dead,” said Hagrid gloomily. “Too much lettuce.”
“Oh no!” said Ron, his lip twitching.
“An’ them Dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an’ all,” said Hagrid, with a sudden shudder.
“Gotta walk past ‘em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. ‘S like bein’ back in
Azkaban —”
He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him breathlessly. They had
never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said
timidly, “Is it awful in there, Hagrid?”
“Yeh’ve no idea,” said Hagrid quietly. “Never bin anywhere like it. Thought I was goin’ mad.
Kep’ goin’ over horrible stuff in me mind…the day I got expelled from Hogwarts…day me dad
died…day I had ter let Norbert go…”
His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once won in a game of cards.
“Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while. An’ yeh can’ really see the point o’ livin’ at
all. I used ter hope I’d jus’ die in me sleep. When they let me out, it was like bein’ born again,
ev’rythin’ came floodin’ back, it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world. Mind, the Dementors weren’t keen
on lettin’ me go.”
“But you were innocent!” said Hermione.
Hagrid snorted.
“Think that matters to them? They don’ care. Long as they’ve got a couple o’ hundred humans
stuck there with ‘em, so they can leech all the happiness out of ‘em, they don’ give a damn who’s
guilty an’ who’s not.”
Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he said quietly, “Thought o’ jus’
letting Buckbeak go…tryin’ ter make him fly away…but how d’yeh explain ter a Hippogriff it’s
gotta go inter hidin’? An’ — an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law…” He looked up at them, tears
leaking down his face again. “I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.”
The trip to Hagrid’s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione
had hoped. Though Harry had by no means forgotten about Black, he couldn’t brood constantly on
revenge if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron, and Hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the
empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three
of them sat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases
of marauding beasts, speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant.
“Here’s something…there was a case in 1722…but the Hippogriff was convicted — ugh, look
what they did to it, that’s disgusting —”
“This might help, look — a Manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they let the Manticore off
— oh — no, that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it…”
Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas decorations had been put
up, despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly
and mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of
armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas trees, glittering with golden
stars. A powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it
had grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron’s pocket to sniff
hopefully at the air.
On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him.
“Oi! Presents!”
Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot
of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his
own presents.
“Another sweater from Mum…maroon again…see if you’ve got one.”
Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the
front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he
moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.
“What’s that?” said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.
“Dunno…”
Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto
his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look.
“I don’t believe it,” he said hoarsely.
It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley.
Its handle glitteredas he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair,
unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden
registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch
twigs that made up the tail.
“Who sent it to you?” said Ron in a hushed voice.
“Look and see if there’s a card,” said Harry.
Ron ripped apart the Firebolt’s wrappings.
“Nothing! Blimey, who’d spend that much on you?”
“Well,” said Harry, feeling stunned, “I’m betting it wasn’t the Dursleys.”
“I bet it was Dumbledore,” said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in
every glorious inch. “He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously…”
“That was my dad’s, though,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was just passing it on to me. He
wouldn’t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can’t go giving students stuff like this —”
“That’s why he wouldn’t say it was from him!” said Ron. “In case some git like Malfoy said it
was favoritism. Hey, Harry —” Ron gave a great whoop of laughter — “Malfoy! Wait ‘til he sees you
on this! He’ll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!”
“I can’t believe this,” Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto
Harry’s bed, laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. “Who—?”
“I know,” said Ron, controlling himself, “I know who it could’ve been — Lupin!”
“What?” said Harry, now starting to laugh himself “Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he’d
be able to buy himself some new robes.”
“Yeah, but he likes you,” said Ron. “And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he
might’ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you —”
“What d’you mean, he was away?” said Harry. “He was ill when I was playing in that match.”
“Well, he wasn’t in the hospital wing,” said Ron. “I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that
detention from Snape, remember?”
Harry frowned at Ron.
“I can’t see Lupin affording something like this.”
“What’re you two laughing about?”
Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was
looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck.
“Don’t bring him in here!” said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed
and stowing him in his pajama pocket.
But Hermione wasn’t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus’s empty bed and stared,
open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.
“Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?”
“No idea,” said Harry. “There wasn’t a card or anything with it.”
To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news. On the
contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.
“What’s the matter with you?” said Ron.
“I don’t know,” said Hermione slowly, “but it’s a bit odd, isn’t it? I mean, this is supposed to be
quite a good broom, isn’t it?”
Ron sighed exasperatedly.
“It’s the best broom there is, Hermione,” he said.
“So it must’ve been really expensive…”
“Probably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms put together,” said Ron happily.
“Well…who’d send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they’d sent it?”
said Hermione.
“Who cares?” said Ron impatiently. “Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?”
“I don’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!” said Hermione shrilly.
Harry and Ron looked at her.
“What d’you think Harry’s going to do with it — sweep the floor?” said Ron.
But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus’s bed, right at Ron’s
chest.
“GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE!” Ron bellowed as Crookshanks’s claws ripped his
pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and
aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry’s bed, knocking it
over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.
Crookshanks’s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tinny, whistling was filling the room. The
Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle Vernon’s old socks and was whirling and
gleaming on the floor.
“I forgot about that!” Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope. “I never wear
those socks if I can help it…”
The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.
“You’d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,” said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry’s bed
nursing his toe. “Can’t you shut that thing up?” he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the
room, Crookshanks’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.
Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk. All that
could be heard now were Ron’s stifled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron’s
hands. It had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron’s pocket, and he was unpleasantly
surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen
out too.
“He’s not looking too good, is he?” Harry said.
“It’s stress!” said Ron. “He’d be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone!”
But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living
only three years, couldn’t help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was
reaching the end of his life. And despite Ron’s frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring
and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died.
Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor common room that
morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to
kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks’s fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up
trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had
brought down to the common room with him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as
well; she didn’t say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been
criticizing her cat.
At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House tables had been moved
against the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room.
Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the
caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy-
looking tailcoat. There were only three other students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and
a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year.
“Merry Christmas!” said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table. “As
there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables…Sit down, sit down!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table.
“Crackers!” said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to
Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to
reveal a large, pointed witches hat topped with a stuffed vulture.
Harry, remembering the Boggart, caught Ron’s eye and they both grinned; Snape’s mouth
thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard’s hat at once.
“Dig in!” he advised the table, beaming around.
As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was
Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined
dress in honor of the occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized dragonfly.
“Sybill, this is a pleasant surprise!” said Dumbledore, standing up.
“I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,” said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway
voice, “and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join
you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you
to forgive my lateness…”
“Certainly, certainly,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “Let me draw you up a chair —”
And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved for a few seconds before
falling with a thud between Professors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did
not sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered a kind
of soft scream.
“I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more
unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!”
“We’ll risk it, Sybill,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently. “Do sit down, the turkey’s getting
stone cold.”
Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth
clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a
large spoon into the nearest tureen.
“Tripe, Sybill?”
Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once more and said, “But
where is dear Professor Lupin?”
“I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,” said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start
serving themselves. “Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.”
“But surely you already knew that, Sybill?” said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.
Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.
“Certainly I knew, Minerva,” she said quietly. “But one does not parade the fact that one is All-
Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others
nervous.”
“That explains a great deal,” said Professor McGonagall tartly.
Professor Trelawney’s voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.
“If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very
long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze
for him —”
“Imagine that,” said Professor McGonagall dryly.
“I doubt,” said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to
Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney’s conversation, “that Professor Lupin is in any
immediate danger. Severus, you’ve made the potion for him again?”
“Yes, Headmaster,” said Snape.
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Then he should be up and about in no time…Derek, have you had
any of the chipolatas? They’re excellent.”
The first-year boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the
platter of sausages with trembling hands.
Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of Christmas dinner, two hours
later. Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still wearing their cracker hats, Harry and Ron got
up first from the table and she shrieked loudly.
“My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?”
“Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry.
“I doubt it will make much difference,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, “unless a mad axe-
man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the Entrance Hall.”
Even Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly affronted.
“Coming?” Harry said to Hermione.
“No,” Hermione muttered. “I want a quick word with Professor McGonagall.”
“Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes,” yawned Ron as they make their way
into the Entrance Hall, which was completely devoid of mad axe-men.
When they reached the portrait hole they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a Christmas part with a
couple of monks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts and his fat pony. He pushed up his visor
toasted them with a flagon of mead.
“Merry — hic — Christmas! Password?”
“Scurvy cur,” said Ron.
“And the same to you, sir!” roared Sir Cadogan, as the painting swung forward to admit them.
Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected his Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit
Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought them downstairs and tried to find something to
do with the Firebolt; however, there where no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already
it seemed pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle, until the
portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall.
Though Professor McGonagall was Head of Gryffindor House, Harry had only seen her in the
common room once before, and that had been to make a very grave announcement. He and Ron
stared at her, both holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them, sat down, picked up the
nearest book and hid her face behind it.
“So that’s it, is it?” said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to the fireside and staring at
the Firebolt. “Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.”
Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her forehead reddening over the top
of her book, which was upside-down.
“May I?” said Professor McGonagall, but she didn’t wait for an answer before pulling the
Firebolt out of their hands. She examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. “Hmm. And there
was no note at all, Potter? No card? No message of any kind?”
“No,” said Harry blankly.
“I see…” said Professor McGonagall. “Well, I’m afraid I will have to take this, Potter.”
“W — what?” said Harry, scrambling to his feet. “Why?”
“It will need to be checked for jinxes,” said Professor McGonagall. “Of course, I’m no expert,
but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down —”
“Strip it down?” repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.
“It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks,” said Professor McGonagall. “You will have it back if
we are sure it is jinx-free.”
“There’s nothing wrong with it!” said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. “Honestly, Professor —”
“You can’t know that, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, “not until you’ve flown
it, at any rate, and I’m afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been
tampered with. I shall keep you informed.”
Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which
closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his
hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione.
“What did you go running to McGonagall for?”
Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron
defiantly.
“Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall agrees with me — that that broom was
probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!”
CHAPTER TWELVE
THE PATRONUS
Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn’t stop him from being angry with her.
He had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, because of
her interference, he didn’t know whether he would ever see it again. He was positive that there was
nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it had been
subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx tests?
Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the stripping-down of a brand-
new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she
had acted for the best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had taken
refuge in the library and didn’t try to persuade her to come back. All in all, they were glad when the
rest of the school returned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy
again. Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started.
“Had a good Christmas?” he said, and then, without waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered
his voice, and said, “I’ve been, doing some thinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you
know. If the Dementors come to the next one…I mean…we can’t afford you to — well —”
Wood broke off, looking awkward.
“I’m working on it,” said Harry quickly. “Professor Lupin said he’d train me to ward off the
Dementors. We should be starting this week. He said he’d have time after Christmas.”
“Ah,” said Wood, his expression clearing. “Well, in that case — I really didn’t want to lose you
as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a new broom yet?”
“No,” said Harry.
“What! You’d better get a move on, you know — you can’t ride that Shooting Star against
Ravenclaw!”
“He got a Firebolt for Christmas,” said Ron.
“A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A — a real Firebolt?”
“Don’t get excited, Oliver,” said Harry gloomily. “I haven’t got it anymore. It was confiscated.”
And he explained all about how the Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes.
“Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?”
“Sirius Black,” Harry said wearily. “He’s supposed to be after me. So McGonagall reckons he
might have sent it.”
Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his Seeker, Wood said, “But
Black couldn’t have bought a Firebolt! He’s on the run! The whole country’s on the lookout for him!
How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?”
“I know,” said Harry, “but McGonagall still wants to strip it down —”
Wood went pale.
“I’ll go and talk to her, Harry,” he promised. “I’ll make her see reason…A Firebolt…a real
Firebolt, on our team…She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we do…I’ll make her see sense. A
Firebolt…”
Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours
on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for
their enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the
fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs.
The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now
teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line
she had ever seen.
It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to; after his conversation with
Wood, he wanted to get started on his anti-Dementor lessons as soon as possible.
“Ah yes,” said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class. “Let me
see…how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large
enough…I’ll have to think carefully about how we’re going to do this…We can’t bring a real
Dementor into the castle to practice on…”
“Still looks ill, doesn’t he?” said Ron as they walked down the corridor, heading to dinner.
“What d’you reckon’s the matter with him?”
There was a loud and impatient “tuh” from behind them. It was Hermione, who had been
sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was so full of books it wouldn’t close.
“And what are you tutting at us for?” said Ron irritably.
“Nothing,” said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her shoulder.
“Yes, you were,” said Ron. “I said I wonder what’s wrong with Lupin, and you —”
“Well, isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, with a look of maddening superiority.
“If you don’t want to tell us, don’t,” snapped Ron.
“Fine,” said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.
“She doesn’t know,” said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. “She’s just trying to get us to
talk to her again.”
At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic
classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the lamps with his wand and had
waited only five minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he
heaved onto Professor Binn’s desk.
“What’s that?” said Harry.
“Another Boggart,” said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. “I’ve been combing the castle ever since
Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet. It’s the nearest
we’ll get to a real Dementor. The Boggart will turn into a Dementor when he sees you, so we’ll be
able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we’re not using him; there’s a cupboard
under my desk he’ll like.”
“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at all and merely glad that
Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real Dementor.
“So…” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the
same. “The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond
Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.”
“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.
“Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-
Dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the Dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large
club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very
things that the Dementor feeds upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel
despair, as real humans can, so the Dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the
charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”
“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a
single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at
the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a
broomstick.
“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful, soaring sensation of his
stomach.
“The incantation is this —” Lupin cleared his throat. “Expecto patronum!”
“Expecto patronum,” Harry repeated under his breath, “expecto patronum.”
“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”
“Oh — yeah —” said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride. “Expecto
patrono — no, patronum — sorry — expecto patronum, expecto patronum”
Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas.
“Did you see that?” said Harry excitedly. “Something happened!”
“Very good,” said Lupin, smiling. “Right, then — ready to try it on a Dementor?”
“Yes,” Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted
classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding…Any second
now, he might hear his mother again…but he shouldn’t think that, or he would hear her again, and
he didn’t want to…or did he?
Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.
A Dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward Harry, one glistening,
scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around the classroom flickered and went out. The
Dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling
breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him —
“Expecto patronum!” Harry yelled. “Expecto patronum! Expecto —”
But the classroom and the Dementor were dissolving…Harry was falling again through thick
white fog, and his mother’s voice was louder than ever, echoing inside his head — “Not Harry! Not
Harry! Please — I’ll do anything —”
“Stand aside — stand aside, girl —”
“Harry!”
Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor. The classroom lamps were
alight again. He didn’t have to ask what had happened.
“Sorry,” he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses.
“Are you all right?” said Lupin.
“Yes…” Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it.
“Here —” Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. “Eat this before we try again. I didn’t expect
you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had.”
“It’s getting worse,” Harry muttered, biting off the Frog’s head. “I could hear her louder that
time — and him — Voldemort —”
Lupin looked paler than usual.
“Harry, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than understand —”
“I do!” said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog into his mouth. “I’ve got to!
What if the Dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we
lose this game we’ve lost the Quidditch Cup!”
“All right then…” said Lupin. “You might want to select another memory, a happy memory, I
mean, to concentrate on…That one doesn’t seem to have been strong enough…”
Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the House
Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He gripped his wand tightly again
and took up his position in the middle of the classroom.
“Ready?” said Lupin, gripping the box lid.
“Ready,” said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning,
and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened.
“Go!” said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark once more. The
Dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry —
“Expecto patronum!” Harry yelled. “Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat—”
White fog obscured his senses…big, blurred shapes were moving around him…then came a new
voice, a man’s voice, shouting, panicking —
“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off —”
The sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a door bursting open — a cackle of high-
pitched laughter —
“Harry! Harry…wake up…”
Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute before Harry understood
why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.
“I heard my dad,” Harry mumbled. “That’s the first time I’ve ever heard him — he tried to take
on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it…”
Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat. He bent his
face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin
wouldn’t see.
“You heard James?” said Lupin in a strange voice.
“Yeah…” Face dry, Harry looked up. “Why — you didn’t know my dad, did you?”
“I — I did, as a matter of fact,” said Lupin. “We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry —
perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced…I shouldn’t have
suggested putting you through this…”
“No!” said Harry. He got up again. “I’ll have one more go! I’m not thinking of happy enough
things, that’s what it is…hang on…”
He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory…one that he could turn into a good, strong
Patronus…
The moment when he’d first found out he was a wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for
Hogwarts! If that wasn’t a happy memory, he didn’t know what was…Concentrating very hard on
how he had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the
packing case once more.
“Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment.
“Concentrating hard? All right — go!”
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the Dementor rose out of it; the room
fell cold and dark —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” Harry bellowed. “EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO
PATRONUM!”
The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again — except this time, it sounded as though it
were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder and softer again…and he could still see
the Dementor…it had halted…and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of
Harry’s wand, to hover between him and the Dementor, and though Harry’s legs felt like water, he
was still on his feet — though for how much longer, he wasn’t sure…
“Riddikulus!” roared Lupin, springing forward.
There was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus vanished along with the Dementor; he
sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he’d just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the
corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the Boggart back into the packing case with his
wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.
“Excellent!” Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. “Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a
start!”
“Can we have another go? Just one more go?”
“Not now,” said Lupin firmly. “You’ve had enough for one night. Here —”
He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes’ best chocolate.
“Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week?”
“Okay,” said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps
that had rekindled with the disappearance of the Dementor. A thought had just occurred to him.
“Professor Lupin?” he said. “If you knew my dad, you must’ve known Sirius Black as well.”
Lupin turned very quickly.
“What gives you that idea?” he said sharply.
“Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too…”
Lupin’s face relaxed.
“Yes, I knew him,” he said shortly. “Or I thought I did. You’d better be off, Harry, it’s getting
late.”
Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a corner, then took a detour
behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn’t
mentioned Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry’s thoughts wandered
back to his mother and father…
He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it
was to hear his parents’ last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had
heard their voices since he was a very small child. But he’d never be able to produce a proper
Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again…
“They’re dead,” he told himself sternly. “They’re dead and listening to echoes of them won’t
bring them back. You’d better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup.”
He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and headed back to Gryffindor
Tower.
Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin won, though narrowly.
According to Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat
Ravenclaw too. He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week. This meant that
with Lupin’s anti-Dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch
practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he was not showing the
strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her.
Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables
spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects,
and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was
interrupted.
“How’s she doing it?” Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on
Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering
pile of books.
“Doing what?”
“Getting to all her classes!” Ron said. “I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy
witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday’s lesson, but Hermione can’t’ve been there,
because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me she’s never
missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she’s never
missed one of them either!”
Harry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione’s impossible schedule at the
moment; he really needed to get on with Snape’s essay. Two seconds later, however, he was
interrupted again, this time by Wood.
“Bad news, Harry. I’ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She — er —
got a bit shirty with me. Told me I’d got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about
winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn’t care if it threw
you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first.” Wood shook his head in disbelief. “Honestly, the
way she was yelling at me…you’d think I’d said something terrible. Then I asked her how much
longer she was going to keep it…” He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGonagall’s
severe voice. “As long as necessary, Wood”…I reckon it’s time you ordered a new broom, Harry.
There’s an order form at the back of Which Broomstick…you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand
and One, like Malfoy’s got.”
“I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,” said Harry flatly.
January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather. The
match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer, but Harry still hadn’t ordered a new
broom. He was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every
Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face
averted.
“No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor McGonagall told him the twelfth time this
happened, before he’d even opened his mouth. “We’ve checked for most of the usual curses, but
Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you once we’ve
finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.”
To make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-Dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he
had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the
Boggart-Dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the Dementor away.
All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it
there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents’ voices again.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin, sternly in their fourth week of
practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You
aren’t passing out anymore, are you?”
“I thought a Patronus would — charge the Dementors down or something,” said Harry
dispiritedly. “Make them disappear —”
“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve achieved a great deal in a very short
space of time. If the Dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be able
to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground.”
“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry.
“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling. “Here — you’ve earned a drink.
Something from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have tried it before —”
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I like that stuff!”
Lupin raised an eyebrow.
“Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,” Harry lied quickly.
“I see,” said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. “Well — let’s drink to a Gryffindor
victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I’m supposed to take sides, as a teacher…” he added hastily.
They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he’d been wondering for a
while.
“What’s under a Dementor’s hood?”
Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.
“Hmmm…well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the
Dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.”
“What’s that?”
“They call it the Dementor’s Kiss,” said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. “It’s what
Dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth
under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and — and suck out his
soul.”
Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.
“What — they kill —?”
“Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as
long as your brain and heart are still working. But you’ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory,
no…anything. There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just exist. As an empty shell. And your
soul is gone forever…lost.”
Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, “It’s the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in
the Daily Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the Dementors permission to perform it if
they find him.”
Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through
their mouth. But then he thought of Black.
“He deserves it,” he said suddenly.
“You think so?” said Lupin lightly. “Do you really think anyone deserves that?”
“Yes,” said Harry defiantly. “For…for some things…”
He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he’d overheard about Black in
the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and father, but it would have involved
revealing that he’d gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn’t be very
impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic
classroom.
Harry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was under a Dementor’s hood, the answer had been
so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul
sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
“Do watch where you’re going, Potter!”
“Sorry, Professor —”
“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well, here it is, we’ve done
everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all — you’ve
got a very good friend somewhere, Potter…”
Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.
“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”
“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. “I daresay you’ll need to
get the feel of it before Saturday’s match, won’t you? And Potter —do try and win, won’t you? Or
we’ll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to
remind me only last night…”
Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a
corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to ear.
“She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow?”
“Yeah…anything…” said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. “You know what
— we should make up with Hermione…She was only trying to help…”
“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. “She’s in the common room now working — for a change.”
They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with
Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him entrance.
“I wrote them down!” Neville was saying tearfully. “But I must’ve dropped them somewhere!”
“A likely tale!” roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: “Good even, my fine young
yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force entry to the chambers within!”
“Oh, shut up,” said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.
“I’ve lost the passwords!” Neville told them miserably. “I made him tell me what passwords he
was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don’t know what I’ve done
with them!”
“Oddsbodkins,” said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly
swung forward to let them into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every
head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt.
“Where’d you get it, Harry?”
“Will you let me have a go?”
“Have you ridden it yet, Harry?”
“Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on Cleansweep Sevens!”
“Can I just hold it, Harry?”
After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and admired from every
angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the only person who
hadn’t rushed over to them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron
approached her table and at last, she looked up.
“I got it back,” said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt.
“See, Hermione? There wasn’t anything wrong with it!” said Ron.
“Well — there might have been!” said Hermione. “I mean, at least you know now that it’s safe!”
“Yeah, I suppose so,” said Harry. “I’d better put it upstairs.”
“I’ll take it!” said Ron eagerly. “I’ve got to give Scabbers his rat tonic.”
He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys’
staircase.
“Can I sit down, then?” Harry asked Hermione.
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair.
Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was
still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (‘Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity’)
and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over.
“How are you getting through all this stuff?” Harry asked her.
“Oh, well — you know — working hard,” said Hermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked
almost as tired as Lupin.
“Why don’t you just drop a couple of subjects?” Harry asked, watching her lifting books as she
searched for her rune dictionary.
“I couldn’t do that!” said Hermione, looking scandalized.
“Arithmancy looks terrible,” said Harry, picking up a very complicated-looking number chart.
“Oh no, it’s wonderful!” said Hermione earnestly. “It’s my favorite subject! It’s —”
But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out. At that precise
moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys’ staircase. The whole common room fell silent,
staring, petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder — and
then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.
“LOOK!” he bellowed, striding over to Hermione’s table. “LOOK!” he yelled, shaking the sheets
in her face.
“Ron, what —?”
“SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!”
Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry looked down at the
sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it. Something that looked horribly like-
“BLOOD!” Ron yelled into the stunned silence. “HE’S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WAS ON THE FLOOR?”
“N — no,” said Hermione in a trembling voice.
Ron threw something down onto Hermione’s rune translation. Hermione and Harry leaned
forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW
It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione’s friendship. Each was so angry with the other that
Harry couldn’t see how they’d ever make up.
Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks’s attempts to eat Scabbers
seriously, hadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that
Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys’ beds.
Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten
Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been
prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron’s head in the Magical
Menagerie.
Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out
to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.
“Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!” she said shrilly. “First the Firebolt, now Scabbers,
everything’s my fault, isn’t it! Just leave me alone, Harry, I’ve got a lot of work to do!”
Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.
“Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,” said Fred bracingly. “And
he’s been off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly
— one swallow — he probably didn’t feel a thing.”
“Fred!” said Ginny indignantly.
“All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,” said George.
“He bit Goyle for us once!” Ron said miserably. “Remember, Harry?”
“Yeah, that’s true,” said Harry.
“His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. “Let the scar on Goyle’s finger stand
as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh, come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a
new rat, what’s the point of moaning?”
In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor
team’s final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after
they’d finished. This did seem to take Ron’s mind off Scabbers for a moment (“Great! Can I try and
shoot a few goals on it?”) so they set off for the Quidditch field together.
Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just
as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and
gave them the benefit of her professional opinion.
“Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it’s a slight list to the tail end — you
often find they develop a drag after a few years. They’ve updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than
the Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they’ve stopped making them. I
learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom it was too…”
She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, “Er — Madam Hooch? Is it okay if
Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to practice…”
“Oh — right — here you are, then, Potter,” said Madam Hooch. “I’ll sit over here with
Weasley…”
She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood
for his final instructions for tomorrow’s match.
“Harry, I’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It’s Cho Chang. She’s a fourth
year, and she’s pretty good…I really hoped she wouldn’t be fit, she’s had some problems with
injuries…” Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, “On
the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt.”
He gave Harry’s broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, “Okay, everyone, let’s go —”
And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the ground.
It was better than he’d ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to
obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned
into a green-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went
into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty
feet into the air again —
“Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out!” Wood called.
Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch
dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.
The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute’s head start, then tore
after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell’s knee, looped her
easily, and caught it again.
It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst,
performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn’t have
a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.
“I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow!” said Wood. “Not unless — Harry, you’ve sorted
out your Dementor problem, haven’t you?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger.
“The Dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore’d go ballistic,” said Fred confidently.
“Well, let’s hope not,” said Wood. “Anyway — good work, everyone. Let’s get back to the
tower…turn in early…”
“I’m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,” Harry told Wood, and while the rest
of the team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the
stands and came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.
“Here you go,” said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.
Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering
darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him. Night had fallen before
Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they
go back to the castle.
Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing
the Firebolt’s superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They
were halfway toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart
turn over — a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.
Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.
“What’s the matter?” said Ron.
Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, “Lumos!”
A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and illuminated its branches; there,
crouching among the budding leaves, was Crookshanks.
“Get out of here!” Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but
before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.
“See?” Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. “She’s still letting him wander about
wherever he wants — probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now…”
Harry didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure
for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more.
slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn’t say anything to Ron — nor did he look left
or right until they had reached the well lit entrance hall.
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of
whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great
Hall, heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited muttering.
Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck.
“Did you see his face?” said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfoy. “He can’t believe it! This is
brilliant!”
Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.
“Put it here, Harry,” he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it
so that its name faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming
over to look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb
replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy’s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she
could actually hold the Firebolt.
“Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily as she examined the Firebolt closely.
“Penelope and I have got a bet on,” he told the team. “Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!”
Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to her table.
“Harry — make sure you win,” said Percy, in an urgent whisper. “I haven’t got ten Galleons. Yes,
I’m coming, Penny!” And he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast.
“Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?” said a cold, drawling voice.
Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Goyle right behind him.
“Yeah, reckon so,” said Harry casually.
“Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it?” said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously. “Shame it
doesn’t come with a parachute — in case you get too near a Dementor.”
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,” said Harry. “Then it could catch the
Snitch for you.”
The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy’s pale eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They
watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking
Malfoy whether Harry’s broom really was a Firebolt.
At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn’t
have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very
light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was
starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the
school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand
from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He
only hoped he wouldn’t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd,
watching.
“You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms. “If we
lose this match, we’re out of the running, just — just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we’ll
be okay!”
They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue,
were already standing in the middle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their
team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn’t help noticing, nervous as he
was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their
captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn’t think had anything to
do with nerves.
“Wood, Davies, shake hands,” Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook hands with the
Ravenclaw Captain.
“Mount your brooms…on my whistle…three — two — one —”
Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom;
he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to
the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan.
“They’re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for
Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt’s going to be the broom of choice for the
national teams at this year’s World Championship —”
“Jordan, would you mind telling us what’s going on in the match?” interrupted Professor
McGonagall’s voice.
“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of background information — the Firebolt,
incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and—”
“Jordan!”
“Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading for goal…”
Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and
noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier — she kept
cutting across him, forcing him to change direction.
“Show her your acceleration, Harry!” Fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger
that was aiming for Alicia.
Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind.
Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field
went wild, he saw it — the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers.
Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him — Harry was speeding up,
excitement flooding him; dives were his specialty, he was ten feet away —
Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered
off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.
There was a great “Ooooooh” of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much
applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the
second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid
it.
“Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter’s really putting it
through its paces now, see it turn — Chang’s Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt’s precision
— balance is really noticeable in these long —”
“JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE
COMMENTARY!”
Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty
points ahead — if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower,
narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically — a glint of gold, a flutter of
tiny wings — the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post…
Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead — but just then, Cho appeared out of
thin air, blocking him —
“HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!” Wood roared as Harry swerved to
avoid a collision. “KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!”
Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry
turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye,
he saw Cho following him…She’d decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch
herself…All right, then…if she wanted to tail him, she’d have to take the consequences…
He dived again, and Cho, thinking he’d seen the Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the
dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the
third time — the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.
He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on the Snitch with every
second — then —
“Oh!” screamed Cho, pointing.
Distracted, Harry looked down.
Three Dementors, three tall, black, hooded Dementors, were looking up at him.
He didn’t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand
and roared, “Expecto patronum!”
Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He knew it
had shot directly at the Dementors but didn’t pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he
looked ahead — he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just
managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.
Madam Hooch’s whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs
bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled
off his broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.
“That’s my boy!” Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had
him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off. In complete disarray, the team
managed to make its way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle
of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he knew it, he had been
engulfed by the cheering crowd.
“Yes!” Ron yelled, yanking Harry’s arm into the air. “Yes! Yes!”
“Well done, Harry!” said Percy, looking delighted. “Ten Galleons to me! Must find Penelope,
excuse me —”
“Good for you, Harry!” roared Seamus Finnigan.
“Ruddy brilliant!” boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling Gryffindors.
“That was quite some Patronus,” said a voice in Harry’s ear.
Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased.
“The Dementors didn’t affect me at all!” Harry said excitedly. “I didn’t feel a thing!”
“That would be because they — er — weren’t Dementors,” said Professor Lupin. “Come and see
—”
He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field.
“You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,” said Lupin.
Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus
Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded
robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle’s shoulders. Standing over them, with
an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.
“An unworthy trick!” she was shouting. “A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor
Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor
Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!”
If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor’s victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his
way through to Harry’s side, doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate
himself from the robe, Goyle’s head still stuck inside it.
“Come on, Harry!” said George, fighting his way over. “Party! Gryffindor common room, now!”
“Right,” said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the
way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle.
It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well
into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with
armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.
“How did you do that?” squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint
Toads into the crowd.
“With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,” Fred muttered in Harry’s ear.
Only one person wasn’t joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner,
attempting to read an enormous book entitled Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry
broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went
over to her.
“Did you even come to the match?” he asked her.
“Of course I did,” said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not looking up. “And I’m
very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.”
“Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,” Harry said, looking over at Ron and
wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.
“I can’t, Harry. I’ve still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!” said Hermione, now
sounding slightly hysterical. “Anyway…” She glanced over at Ron too. “He doesn’t want me to join
in.”
There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn’t just
been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them —”
Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous
book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls’ dormitories and out of
sight.
“Can’t you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron quietly.
“No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was sorry — but she’ll never admit she’s wrong,
Hermione. She’s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.”
The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing
gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed
the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed,
twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt
himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep…
He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder,
following something silvery-white. It was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only
catch glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved
faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now
he was running flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing
and —
“AAARRGGHH! NOOO!”
Harry woke as suddenly as though he’d been hit in the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he
fumbled with his hangings, he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice
from the other side of the room.
“What’s going on?”
Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the divide in his curtains, he
ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp.
Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of utmost terror on his face.
“Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!”
“What?”
“Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!”
“You sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?” said Dean.
“Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!”
They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first, and they sprinted back
down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy voices called after them.
“Who shouted?”
“What’re you doing?”
The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered with the debris from the
party. It was deserted.
“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?”
“I’m telling you, I saw him!”
“What’s all the noise?”
“Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!”
A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling on dressing gowns and yawning. Boys,
too, were reappearing.
“Excellent, are we carrying on?” said Fred Weasley brightly.
“Everyone back upstairs!” said Percy, hurrying into the common room and pinning his Head
Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.
“Perce — Sirius Black!” said Ron faintly. “In our dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up!”
The common room went very still.
“Nonsense!” said Percy, looking startled. “You had too much to eat, Ron — had a nightmare—”
“I’m telling you —”
“Now, really, enough’s enough!”
Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the
common room and stared furiously around.
“I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected
better of you!”
“I certainly didn’t authorize this, Professor!” said Percy, puffing himself up indignantly. “I was
just telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron here had a nightmare —”
“IT WASN’T A NIGHTMARE!” Ron yelled. “PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS
BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!”
Professor McGonagall stared at him.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole?”
“Ask him!” said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir Cadogan’s picture. “Ask him if
he saw —”
Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the portrait back open and went
outside. The whole common room listened with bated breath. “Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man
enter Gryffindor Tower?”
“Certainly, good lady!” cried Sir Cadogan.
There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.
“You — you did?” said Professor McGonagall. “But — but the password!”
“He had ‘em!” said Sir Cadogan proudly. “Had the whole week’s, my lady! Read ‘em off a little
piece of paper!”
Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd.
She was white as chalk.
“Which person,” she said, her voice shaking, “which abysmally foolish person wrote down this
week’s passwords and left them lying around?”
There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks. Neville Longbottom,
trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raised his hand slowly into the air.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
SNAPE’S GRUDGE
No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle was being searched
again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common room, waiting to hear whether Black had
been caught. Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.
Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick
could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly
bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse
holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the
seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely
nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection. A
bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing
group, talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.
Harry couldn’t help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on the third floor remained
unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they —
and now Harry, Ron, and Hermione — were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway
within it.
“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” Harry asked Ron.
“We know he’s not coming in through Honeyduke’s,” said Ron dismissively. “We’d’ve heard if
the shop had been broken into.”
Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up too, he would never be
able to go into Hogsmeade again.
Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life, people were paying more
attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience.
Though still severely shaken by the night’s events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had
happened, with a wealth of detail.
“…I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know?
But then there was this draft…I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled
down…I rolled over…and I saw him standing over me…like a skeleton, with loads of filthy
hair…holding this great long knife, must’ve been twelve inches…and he looked at me, and I looked
at him, and then I yelled, and he scampered.
“Why, though?” Ron added to Harry as the group of second year girls who had been listening to
his chilling tale departed. “Why did he run?”
Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not
silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn’t mind
murdering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were
asleep.
“He must’ve known he’d have a job getting back out of the castle once you’d yelled and woken
people up,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’d’ve had to kill the whole house to get back through the
portrait hole…then he would’ve met the teachers…”
Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him
from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the
password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for
somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him. None of these
punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him. Two
days after Black’s break-in, she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive
over breakfast — a Howler.
The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual, and Neville choked as a
huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who
were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once — Ron had got one from his
mother the year before.
“Run for it, Neville,” Ron advised.
Neville didn’t need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding it before him like a bomb,
sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They
heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall — Neville’s grandmother’s voice, magically magnified
to a hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole
family.
Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too.
Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist.
“Ouch! Oh — thanks, Hedwig.”
Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of Neville’s cornflakes. The
note inside said:
Dear Harry and Ron,
How about having tea with me this afternoon ‘round six? I’ll come collect you from the castle. WAIT
FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN.
Cheers,
Hagrid
“He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said Ron.
So at six o’clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls
at a run, and headed down to the entrance hall.
Hagrid was already waiting for them.
“All right, Hagrid!” said Ron. “S’pose you want to hear about Saturday night, do you?”
“I’ve already heard all abou’ it,” said Hagrid, opening the front doors and leading them outside.
“Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly put out.
The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid’s cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top
of Hagrid’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of
dead ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and
a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid’s wardrobe door.
“What are they for, Hagrid?” said Harry.
“Buckbeak’s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures,” said Hagrid.
“This Friday. Him an’ me’ll be goin’ down ter London together. I’ve booked two beds on the
Knight Bus…”
Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak’s trial was so near,
and judging by the uneasy look on Ron’s face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise
about helping him prepare Buckbeak’s defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of
their minds.
Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they knew better than to
accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid’s cooking.
“I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two,” said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and
looking uncharacteristically serious.
“What?” said Harry.
“Hermione,” said Hagrid.
“What about her?” said Ron.
“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin comin’ down ter visit me a lot since Chris’mas. Bin
feelin’ lonely. Firs’ yeh weren’ talking to her because o’ the Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her
because her cat —”
“– ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily.
“Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid continued doggedly. “She’s cried a fair few times,
yeh know. Goin’ through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more’n she can chew, if yeh ask
me, all the work she’s tryin’ ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak’s case, mind…She’s
found some really good stuff fer me…reckon he’ll stand a good chance now…”
“Hagrid, we should’ve helped as well — sorry —” Harry began awkwardly.
“I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said Hagrid, waving Harry’s apology aside. “Gawd knows yeh’ve had
enough ter be getting’ on with. I’ve seen yeh practicin’ Quidditch ev’ry hour o’ the day an’ night —
but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two’d value yer friend more’n broomsticks or rats. Tha’s all.”
Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.
“Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She’s got her heart in the right
place, Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her —”
“If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her again!” Ron said angrily. “But she’s still sticking
up for it! It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word against it!”
“Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou’ their pets,” said Hagrid wisely. Behind him,
Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid’s pillow.
They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor’s improved chances for the Quidditch
Cup. At nine o’clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the castle.
A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the
common room.
“Hogsmeade, next weekend!” said Ron, craning over the heads to read the new notice. “What
d’you reckon?” he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit down.
“Well, Filch hasn’t done anything about the passage into Honeydukes…” Harry said, even more
quietly.
“Harry!” said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was
sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding
her.
“Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again…I’ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map!” said
Hermione.
“Can you hear someone talking, Harry?” growled Ron, not looking at Hermione.
“Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you! I mean it, I’ll
tell —”
“So now you’re trying to get Harry expelled!” said Ron furiously. “Haven’t you done enough
damage this year?”
Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap.
Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron’s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and
hurried away toward the girls’ dormitories.
“So how about it?” Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption. “Come on, last
time we went you didn’t see anything. You haven’t even been inside Zonko’s yet!”
Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.
“Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.”
On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder’s
Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting
suspicious looks down the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him
walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front
doors.
“Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get back!”
Ron grinned and winked.
Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of his pocket as he went.
Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction.
Harry squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.
Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, “Dissendium!” and shoved his bag into the statue,
but before he could climb in himself, Neville came around the corner.
“Harry! I forgot you weren’t going to Hogsmeade either!”
“Hi, Neville,” said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into
his pocket. “What are you up to?”
“Nothing,” shrugged Neville. “Want a game of Exploding Snap?”
“Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for Lupin —”
“I’ll come with you!” said Neville brightly. “I haven’t done it either!”
“Er — hang on — yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!”
“Great, you can help me!” said Neville, his round face anxious. “I don’t understand that thing
about the garlic at all — do they have to eat it, or —”
He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry’s shoulder.
It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.
“And what are you two doing here?” said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the
other. “An odd place to meet —”
To Harry’s immense disquiet, Snape’s black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them,
and then to the one-eyed witch.
“We’re not — meeting here,” said Harry. “We just — met here.”
“Indeed?” said Snape. “You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places, Potter, and you are
very rarely there for no good reason…I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where
you belong.”
Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the corner, Harry looked back.
Snape was running one of his hands over the one-eyed witch’s head, examining it closely.
Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the password, then pretending
he’d left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls,
he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose.
The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map carefully and saw, with a
leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was now back in its office.
He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself inside, and slid down
to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute. He wiped the Marauder’s Map blank again, then
set off at a run.
Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside
Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back.
“It’s me,” he muttered.
“What kept you?” Ron hissed.
“Snape was hanging around.”
They set off up the High Street.
“Where are you?” Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. “Are you still there? This
feels weird…”
They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt
so that Harry could have a good look around. The owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three
hundred of them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls (“Local Deliveries Only”),
which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry’s hand.
Then they visited Zonko’s, which was so packed with students Harry had to exercise great care
not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and
George’s wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under
the cloak. They left Zonko’s with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on
entering, but their pockets bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a
Nose-Biting Teacup apiece.
The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying indoors, so they walked past
the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling
in Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight was slightly creepy,
with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.
“Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,” said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it. “I
asked Nearly Headless Nick…he says he’s heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in.
Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut…”
Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes
when they heard voices nearby. Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the
hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was
speaking.
“…should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the hearing to tell them
about my arm…about how I couldn’t use it for three months…”
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself…‘There’s no ‘arm in
‘im, ‘onest—’…That Hippogriff’s as good as dead—”
Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent grin.
“What are you doing, Weasley?”
Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.
“Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you, Weasley? Dreaming about having your own
bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true?”
Harry seized the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy.
“Leave him to me,” he hissed in Ron’s ear.
The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around behind Malfoy, Crabbe,
and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path.
“We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,” Malfoy said to Ron. “Just trying to imagine what
he’s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. D’you think he’ll cry when
they cut off his Hippogriff’s—”
SPLAT!
Malfoy’s head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in
muck.
“What the —?”
Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing so hard. Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair
clean.
“What was that? Who did that?”
“Very haunted up here, isn’t it?” said Ron, with the air of one commenting on the weather.
Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts.
Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape.
Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling,
green sludge.
SPLATTER!
Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furiously on the spot, trying to rub it
out of his small, dull eyes.
“It came from over there!” said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the
left of Harry.
Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie. Harry dodged around him,
picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe’s back. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe
did a kind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the only person
Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck out his leg. Crabbe stumbled —
and his huge, flat foot caught the hem of Harry’s cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off
his face.
For a split second, Malfoy stared at him.
“AAARGH!” he yelled, pointing at Harry’s head. Then he turned tail and ran, at breakneck
speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him.
Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.
“Harry!” Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where Harry had
disappeared, “you’d better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone — you’d better get back to the castle,
quick —”
“See you later,” said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path toward
Hogsmeade.
Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe Malfoy? Nobody knew about
the Invisibility Cloak — nobody except Dumbledore. Harry’s stomach turned over — Dumbledore
would know exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said anything —
Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, through the trapdoor
— Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage…Malfoy
would get back first…how long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, a sharp pain in his
side, Harry didn’t slow down until he reached the stone slide. He would have to leave the cloak
where it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher — he hid it in a
shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the
chute. He reached the inside of the witch’s hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through,
and hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from behind the statue, he
heard quick footsteps approaching.
It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes swishing, then stopped in
front of him.
“So,” he said.
There was a look of suppressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware
of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickly hid in his pockets.
“Come with me, Potter,” said Snape.
Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without
Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape’s office.
Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious trouble then too.
Snape had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves
behind his desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.
“Sit,” said Snape.
Harry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing.
“Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,” said Snape.
Harry didn’t say anything.
“He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley — apparently
alone.”
Still, Harry didn’t speak.
“Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit
him in the back of the head. How do you think that could have happened?”
Harry tried to look mildly surprised.
“I don’t know, Professor.”
Snape’s eyes were boring into Harry’s. It was exactly like trying to stare down a Hippogriff.
Harry tried hard not to blink.
“Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what it might have been,
Potter?”
“No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.
“It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.”
There was a long silence.
“Maybe he’d better go to Madam Pomfrey,” said Harry. “If he’s seeing things like —”
“What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?” said Snape softly. “Your head
is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.”
“I know that,” said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear. “It sounds like Malfoy’s
having hallucin —”
“Malfoy is not having hallucinations,” snarled Snape, and he bent down, a hand on each arm of
Harry’s chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. “If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest
of you.”
“I’ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,” said Harry. “Like you told —”
“Can anyone confirm that?”
Harry didn’t say anything. Snape’s thin mouth curled into a horrible smile.
“So,” he said, straightening up again. “Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been
trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto
himself. Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants
to, with no thought for the consequences.”
Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth. He wasn’t going to
do it. Snape had no proof — yet.
“How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting.
“He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think
he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers…The
resemblance between you is uncanny.”
“My dad didn’t strut,” said Harry, before he could stop himself. “And neither do I.”
“Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his
thin face full of malice. “Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so
swollen —”
“SHUT UP!”
Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his last night in Privet Drive
was coursing through him. He didn’t care that Snape’s face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing
dangerously.
“What did you say to me, Potter?”
“I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled. “I know the truth, all right? He saved your
life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn’t even be here if it wasn’t for my dad!”
Snape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.
“And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?” he
whispered. “Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter’s delicate ears?”
Harry bit his lip. He didn’t know what had happened and didn’t want to admit it — but Snape
seemed to have guessed the truth.
“I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father, Potter,” he said, a terrible grin
twisting his face. “Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you
— your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted
in my death if your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about
what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have
been expelled from Hogwarts.”
Snape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.
“Turn out your pockets, Potter!” he spat suddenly.
Harry didn’t move. There was a pounding in his ears.
“Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!”
Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko’s tricks and the Marauder’s Map.
Snap picked up the Zonko’s bag.
“Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw
him. “He brought them back from Hogsmeade last time —”
“Indeed? And you’ve been carrying them around ever since? How very touching…and what is
this?”
Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive.
“Spare bit of parchment,” he said with a shrug.
Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.
“Surely you don’t need such a very old piece of parchment?” he said. “Why don’t I just — throw
this away?”
His hand moved toward the fire.
“No!” Harry said quickly.
“So!” said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. “Is this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley?
Or is it — something else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or — instructions to get into
Hogsmeade without passing the Dementors?”
Harry blinked. Snape’s eyes gleamed.
“Let me see, let me see…” he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his
desk. “Reveal your secret!” he said, touching the wand to the parchment.
Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.
“Show yourself!” Snape said, tapping the map sharply.
It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.
“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you
conceal!” Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.
As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the smooth surface of the
map.
“Mooney presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose
out of other people’s business.”
Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map didn’t stop there. More
writing was appearing beneath the first.
“Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Mooney and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.”
It would have been very funny if the situation hadn’t been so serious. And there was more…
“Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.”
Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he’d opened them, the map had had its last word.
“Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.”
Harry waited for the blow to fall.
“So…” said Snape softly. “We’ll see about this…”
He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace, and
threw it into the flames.
“Lupin!” Snape called into the fire. “I want a word!”
Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast.
Seconds later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.
“You called, Severus?” said Lupin mildly.
“I certainly did,” said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk. “I have
just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.”
Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared on Lupin’s face.
“Well?” said Snape.
Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin was doing some very
quick thinking.
“Well?” said Snape again. “This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be
your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing?”
Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry’s direction, warned him not to
interrupt.
“Full of Dark Magic?” he repeated mildly. “Do you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as
though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not
dangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop —”
“Indeed?” said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. “You think a joke shop could supply
him with such a thing? You don’t think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?”
Harry didn’t understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently, did Lupin.
“You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?” he said. “Harry, do you know any of
these men?”
“No,” said Harry quickly.
“You see, Severus?” said Lupin, turning back to Snape. “It looks like a Zonko product to me —”
Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out of breath, and stopped
just short of Snape’s desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak.
“I — gave — Harry — that — stuff,” he choked. “Bought — it…in Zonko’s…ages — ago…”
“Well!” said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully. “That seems to
clear that up! Severus, I’ll take this back, shall I?” He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes.
“Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us, Severus—”
Harry didn’t dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and Lupin walked all the way
back into the entrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to Lupin.
“Professor, I —”
“I don’t want to hear explanations,” said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance
hall and lowered his voice. “I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years
ago. Yes, I know it’s a map,” he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. “I don’t want to know how it
fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in. Particularly after what
happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can’t let you
have it back, Harry.”
Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.
“Why did Snape think I’d got it from the manufacturers?”
“Because…” Lupin hesitated, “because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of
school. They’d think it extremely entertaining.”
“Do you know them?” said Harry, impressed.
“We’ve met,” he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before.
“Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black
seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the Dementors draw near you
would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A
poor way to repay them — gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.”
He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in Snape’s office.
Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he
remembered the Invisibility Cloak — it was still down there, but he didn’t dare go and get it.
“It’s my fault,” said Ron abruptly. “I persuaded you to go. Lupin’s right, it was stupid, we
shouldn’t’ve done it —”
He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was
walking toward them. One look at her face convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened.
His heart plummeted — had she told Professor McGonagall?
“Come to have a good gloat?” said Ron savagely as she stopped in front of them. “Or have you
just been to tell on us?”
“No,” said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling. “I just
thought you ought to know…Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.”
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL
“He sent me this,” Hermione said, holding out the letter.
Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly
in places that it was very difficult to read.
Dear Hermione,
We lost. I’m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts. Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed
London.
I won’t forget all the help you gave us.
Hagrid
“They can’t do this,” said Harry. “They can’t. Buckbeak isn’t dangerous.”
“Malfoy’s dad’s frightened the Committee into it,” said Hermione, wiping her eyes. “You know
what he’s like. They’re a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There’ll be an appeal,
though, there always is. Only I can’t see any hope…Nothing will have changed.”
“Yeah, it will,” said Ron fiercely. “You won’t have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione.
I’ll help.”
“Oh, Ron!”
Hermione flung her arms around Ron’s neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite
terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.
“Ron, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers…” she sobbed.
“Oh — well — he was old,” said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him.
“And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.”
The safety measures imposed on the students since Black’s second break-in made it impossible
for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking
to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons.
He seemed numb with shock at the verdict.
“S’all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin’ there in black robes an’ I kep’ droppin’
me notes and forgettin’ all them dates yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An’ then Lucius Malfoy
stood up an’ said his bit, and the Committee jus’ did exac’ly what he told ‘em…”
“There’s still the appeal!” said Ron fiercely. “Don’t give up yet, we’re working on it!”
They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy,
who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively.
“S’no good, Ron,” said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps. “That Committee’s in
Lucius Malfoy’s pocket. I’m jus’ gonna make sure the rest o’ Beaky’s time is the happiest he’s ever
had. I owe him that…”
Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried in his handkerchief.
“Look at him blubber!”
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors, listening.
“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said Malfoy. “And he’s supposed to be our
teacher!”
Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first —
SMACK!
She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered.
Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.
“Don’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —”
“Hermione!” said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back.
“Get off, Ron!”
Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for
instructions, thoroughly bewildered.
“C’mon.” Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had disappeared into the
passageway to the dungeons.
“Hermione!” Ron said again, sounding both stunned and impressed.
“Harry, you’d better beat him in the Quidditch final!” Hermione said shrilly. “You just better
had, because I can’t stand it if Slytherin wins!”
“We’re due in Charms,” said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. “We’d better go.”
They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick’s classroom.
“You’re late, boys!” said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door.
“Come along, quickly, wands out, we’re experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we’ve already
divided into pairs —”
Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him.
“Where’s Hermione gone?”
Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn’t entered the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been
right next to him when he had opened the door.
“That’s weird,” said Harry, staring at Ron. “Maybe — maybe she went to the bathroom or
something?”
But Hermione didn’t turn up all lesson.
“She could’ve done with a Cheering Charm on her too,” said Ron as the class left for lunch, all
grinning broadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment.
Hermione wasn’t at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects
of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.
“You don’t think Malfoy did something to her?” Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs
toward Gryffindor Tower.
They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (“Flibbertigibbet”), and
scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room.
Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They
went to sit down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake.
“Wh — what?” said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around. “Is it time to go?
W — which lesson have we got now?”
“Divination, but it’s not for another twenty minutes,” said Harry. “Hermione, why didn’t you
come to Charms?”
“What? Oh no!” Hermione squeaked. “I forgot to go to Charms!”
“But how could you forget?” said Harry. “You were with us till we were right outside the
classroom!”
“I don’t believe it!” Hermione wailed. “Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was
thinking about him and I lost track of things!”
“You know what, Hermione?” said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book
Hermione had been using as a pillow. “I reckon you’re cracking up. You’re trying to do too much.”
“No, I’m not!” said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around
for her bag. “I just made a mistake, that’s all! I’d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say
sorry…I’ll see you in Divination!”
Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawney’s classroom twenty
minutes later, looking extremely harassed.
“I can’t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor
Flitwick hinted they might!”
Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table
was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same
rickety table.
“I thought we weren’t starting crystal balls until next term,” Ron muttered, casting a wary eye
around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby.
“Don’t complain, this means we’ve finished palmistry,” Harry muttered back. “I was getting sick
of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.”
“Good day to you!” said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual
dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit
by the milky glow of their crystal ball.
“I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,” said Professor
Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. “The fates have informed me that
your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.”
Hermione snorted.
“Well, honestly…‘the fates have informed her’. Who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing
prediction!” she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.
It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in
shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not.
“Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,” she said dreamily. “I do not expect any of you to See
when first you peer into the Orb’s infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious
mind and external eyes —” Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his
mouth to stifle the noise — “so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are
lucky, some of you will see before the end of the class.”
And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying
to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as “this is stupid” kept drifting across it. It didn’t help
that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.
“Seen anything yet?” Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour’s quiet crystal gazing.
“Yeah, there’s a burn on this table,” said Ron, pointing. “Someone’s spilled their candle.”
“This is such a waste of time,” Hermione hissed. “I could be practicing something useful. I could
be catching up on Cheering Charms —”
Professor Trelawney rustled past.
“Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?” she
murmured over the clinking of her bangles.
“I don’t need help,” Ron whispered. “It’s obvious what this means. There’s going to be loads of
fog tonight.”
Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.
“Now, really!” said Professor Trelawney as everyone’s heads turned in their direction. Parvati and
Lavender were looking scandalized. “You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!” She approached
their table and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was sure he knew what
was coming —
“There is something here!” Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that
it was reflected twice in her huge glasses. “Something moving…but what is it?”
Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, including his Firebolt, that it wasn’t good news,
whatever it was. And sure enough —
“My dear,” Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. “It is here, plainer than ever
before…my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer…the Gr —”
“Oh, for goodness’ sake!” said Hermione loudly. “Not that ridiculous Grim again!”
Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione’s face. Parvati whispered something
to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying
Hermione with unmistakable anger.
“I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear, it has been
apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don’t remember
ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”
There was a moment’s silence. Then —
“Fine!” said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into her
bag. “Fine!” she repeated, swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair.
“I give up! I’m leaving!”
And to the whole class’s amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and
climbed down the ladder out of sight.
It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have
forgotten all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron’s table, breathing rather
heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.
“Ooooo!” said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. “Ooooo, Professor Trelawney, I’ve
just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn’t you? Didn’t you, Professor? ‘Around Easter, one of our
number will leave us forever!’ You said it ages ago, Professor!”
Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.
“Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. One hopes, however,
that one might have mistaken the Signs…The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know…”
Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that Professor Trelawney
could join their table instead.
“Some day Hermione’s having, eh?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed.
“Yeah…”
Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist. Had Professor
Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing he needed was another near-fatal
accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer.
The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never had so much
homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn’t the only one.
“Call this a holiday!” Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon. “The exams
are ages away, what’re they playing at?”
But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she was taking more
subjects than anybody else. She was usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at
the library the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin’s under her eyes, and seemed constantly
close to tears.
Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak’s appeal. When he wasn’t doing his own work,
he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology
and Fowl or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible
to Crookshanks.
Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to
mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place
on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two
hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that they needed to win the
match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It also meant that the burden of winning fell
largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.
“So you must catch it only if we’re more than fifty points up,” Wood told Harry constantly.
“Only if we’re more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You’ve got
that, Haven’t you? You must catch the Snitch only if we’re —”
“I KNOW, OLIVER!” Harry yelled.
The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match. Gryffindor hadn’t won
the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron’s second oldest brother) had been
Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The
enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the
mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed
his way out of punishment. Harry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to sabotage him in the match
against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined to beat
Malfoy in front of the entire school.
Never, in anyone’s memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By
the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking
point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in
which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks
sprouting out of their ears.
Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn’t walk to class without Slytherins
sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he
went, and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood
had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins
tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge
enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was
surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt’s safety than his
own. When he wasn’t flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to
Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there.
All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the match.
Even Hermione had put down her books.
“I can’t work, I can’t concentrate,” she said nervously.
There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing with the pressure by
being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch
field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself Angelina,
Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred’s and George’s jokes. Harry was sitting with Ron and
Hermione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every
time he did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his
stomach.
“You’re going to be fine,” Hermione told him, though she looked positively terrified.
“You’ve got a Firebolt!” said Ron.
“Yeah…” said Harry, his stomach writhing.
It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, “Team! Bed!”
Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood was yelling, “Where
were you? We had to use Neville instead!” Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the
Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to
avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy’s steed’s mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt.
He fell through the air and woke with a start.
It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn’t taken place yet, that he was
safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t be allowed to play on dragons. He was
feeling very thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to pour himself some
water from the silver jug beneath the window.
The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden
Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent-looking. It looked as though the
conditions for the match would be perfect.
Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye.
An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn.
Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back
to the window. It couldn’t be the Grim — not now — not right before the match —
He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute’s frantic searching, spotted it. It was
skirting the edge of the forest now…It wasn’t the Grim at all…it was a cat…Harry clutched the
window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks…
Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat against the glass.
Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he could see something else moving in
the shadow of the trees too.
And just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the lawn,
Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the
dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry’s death?
“Ron!” Harry hissed. “Ron! Wake up!”
“Huh?”
“I need you to tell me if you can see something!”
“S’all dark, Harry,” Ron muttered thickly. “What’re you on about?”
“Down here —”
Harry looked quickly back out of the window.
Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down
into the shadows of the castle, but they weren’t there. Where had they gone?
A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.
Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous
applause. Harry couldn’t help grinning broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff
tables were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry noticed
that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.
Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself. Then
he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the
conditions. As they left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.
“Good luck, Harry!” called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing.
“Okay — no wind to speak of — sun’s a bit bright, that could impair your vision, watch out for
it — ground’s fairly hard, good, that’ll give us a fast kickoff —”
Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, they saw the front
doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn.
“Locker rooms,” said Wood tersely.
None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling
like he was: as though he’d eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no
time at all, Wood was saying, “Okay, it’s time, let’s go —”
They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three quarters of the crowd was wearing
scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with
slogans like “GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE CUP.” Behind the Slytherin goal
posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on
their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very
grim smile.
“And here are the Gryffindors!” yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as commentator as usual.
“Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best
team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years —”
Lee’s comments were drowned by a tide of ‘boos’ from the Slytherin end.
“And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He’s made some changes in the lineup
and seems to be going for size rather than skill —”
More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was
easily the smallest person On the Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous.
“Captains, shake hands!” said Madam Hooch.
Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other’s hand very tightly; it looked as
though each was trying to break the other’s fingers.
“Mount your brooms!” said Madam Hooch. “Three…two…one…”
The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the
air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he
glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.
“And it’s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinner of Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading
straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no — Quaffle intercepted by
Warrington, Warrington of Slytherin tearing UP the field — WHAM! — nice Bludger work there
by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it’s caught by — Johnson, Gryffindor back in
possession, come on, Angelina — nice swerve around Montague — duck, Angelina, that’s a Bludger!
– SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!”
Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was
screaming its delight
“OUCH!”
Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her.
“Sorry!” said Flint as the crowd below booed. “Sorry, didn’t see her!”
A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater’s club at the back of Flint’s head. Flint’s nose
smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed.
“That will do!” shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between then. “Penalty shot to Gryffindor for
an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their
Chaser!”
“Come off it, Miss!” howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward
to take the penalty.
“Come on, Alicia!” yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd. “YES! SHE’S
BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely, fly forward to take the
Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched.
“’Course, Wood’s a superb Keeper!” Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint waited for Madam
Hooch’s whistle. “Superb! Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed — YES! I DON’T
BELIEVE IT! HE’S SAVED IT!”
Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught
every word of Lee’s commentary. It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor
was more than fifty points up —
“Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession — no! Gryffindor back in possession and
it’s Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she’s streaking up the field — THAT
WAS DELIBERATE!”
Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead of seizing the Quaffle
had grabbed her head. Katie cart-wheeled in the air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the
Quaffle.
Madam Hooch’s whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at
him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker.
“THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING —”
“Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way —”
“I’m telling it like it is, Professor!”
Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of
one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn’t catch it yet — and if Malfoy saw it —
Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around and sped off toward the
Slytherin end — it worked. Malfoy went haring after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the
Snitch there…
WHOOSH.
One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry’s right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater,
Derrick. Then again…
WHOOSH.
The second Bludger grazed Harry’s elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was closing in.
Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised — He
turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening
crunch.
“Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching
their heads. “Too bad, boys! You’ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it’s
Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside her — poke him in
the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in possession, Flint
flying toward the Gryffindor goal posts, come on now, Wood, save —!”
But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so
badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him.
“Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won’t happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten,
and Gryffindor in possession —”
It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had
taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole
hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he’d thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed
Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off
another spectacular save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor.
The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the
match, looking around for it once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead —
Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in
case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred’s and
George’s absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the
other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded.
Madam Hooch was beside herself —
“YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE
SCORING AREA!” she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. “Gryffindor penalty!”
And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington,
knocking the Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal —
seventy-ten.
The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse — Gryffindor was sixty points in the
lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of
eyes following him as he soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy
speeding along behind him.
And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.
Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand,
but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down —
Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt’s
tail, and was pulling it back.
“You —”
Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn’t reach — Malfoy was panting with the effort
of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he’d
wanted to do — the Snitch had disappeared again.
“Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I’ve never seen such tactics.” Madam Hooch screeched, shooting
up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One.
“YOU CHEATING SCUM!” Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of
Professor McGonagall’s reach. “YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B —”
Professor McGonagall didn’t even bother to tell him off. She was actually shaking her finger in
Malfoy’s direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously.
Alicia took Gryffindor’s penalty, but she was so angry she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor
team was losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy’s foul on Harry, were being
spurred on to greater heights.
“Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal — Montague scores —” Lee groaned.
“Seventy-twenty to Gryffindor…”
Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other. Harry wasn’t
going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch…
“Get out of it, Potter!” Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking
him.
“Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON!”
Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch
toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — Harry
wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.
Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins.
“AAAAAAARRRGH!”
They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina’s way was clear.
“SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty!”
Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed,
and zoomed back into the middle of the field.
And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph
on his face — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer —
Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead —
“Go! Go! Go!” Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfoy — Harry flattened himself to
the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at Malfoy’s ankles — he was level —
Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy’s arm out of
the way and —
“YES!”
He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the
crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings
hopelessly against his fingers.
Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck
and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit
them; then Angelina’s, Alicia’s, and Katie’s voices, “We’ve won the Cup! We’ve won the Cup!”
Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth.
Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field. Hands were
raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on
him. Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into
the light, he saw Hagrid, Plastered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh beat ‘em, Harry, yeh beat ‘em!
Wait till I tell Buckbeak!”
There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor
McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor
flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They
simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the
enormous Quidditch Cup.
If only there had been a Dementor around…As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he
lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world’s best Patronus.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION
Harry’s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week. Even the weather
seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody
felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of
iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel
itself dreamily across the surface of the lake.
But they couldn’t. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the
students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concentrating while
enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley had
been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy
was getting ready to take his N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest
qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top
grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments to anybody who
disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more
anxious than Percy was Hermione.
Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once,
but they couldn’t restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself.
The first column read:
Monday
9 o’clock, Arithmancy
9 o’clock, Transfiguration
Lunch
1 o’clock, Charms
1 o’clock, Ancient Runes
“Hermione?” Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days.
“Er — are you sure you’ve copied down these times right?”
“What?” snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it. “Yes, of course I
have.”
“Is there any point asking how you’re going to sit for two exams at once?” said Harry.
“No,” said Hermione shortly. “Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica?”
“Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,” said Ron, but very quietly. Hermione
started shifting heaps of parchment. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had plenty of opportunity to speak
to Hagrid.
“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretense of checking
that Harry’s flobberworm was still alive. “Bin cooped up too long. But still…we’ll know day after
tomorrow — one way or the other —”
They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he
couldn’t get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of
vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before
moving away.
Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday
morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval
witch-hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue’s choconut sundaes with him in the
stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under a baking-hot
sun; then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this
time next day, when it would all be over.
Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor
Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course
outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a Grindylow,
cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring
misleading directions from a Hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new
Boggart.
“Excellent, Harry,” Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk, grinning. “Full marks.”
Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well
until he reached the Hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the
quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it.
After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.
“Hermione!” said Lupin, startled. “What’s the matter?”
“P-P-Professor McGonagall!” Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. “Sh-she said I’d failed
everything!”
It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had regained a grip on herself,
she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione’s
Boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.
Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the
grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.
“Hello there, Harry!” he said. “Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished?”
“Yes,” said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic,
hovered awkwardly in the background.
“Lovely day,” said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. “Pity…pity…”
He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.
“I’m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad Hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to
check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.”
“Does that mean the appeal’s already happened?” Ron interrupted, stepping forward.
“No, no, it’s scheduled for this afternoon,” said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron.
“Then you might not have to witness an execution at all!” said Ron stoutly. “The Hippogriff
might get off!”
Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so
ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a
thin back mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid’s cabin and
said in a feeble voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this…Two o’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?”
The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that he
was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say
something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.
“Why’d you stop me?” said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. “Did you see
them? They’ve even got the axe ready! This isn’t justice!”
“Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can’t go saying things like that to his boss!” said
Hermione, but she too looked very upset. “As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argues his
case properly, they can’t possibly execute Buckbeak…”
But Harry could tell Hermione didn’t really believe what she was saying. All around them,
people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that
afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn’t join in.
Harry’s and Ron’s last exam was Divination; Hermione’s, Muggle Studies. They walked up the
marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the
way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor
Trelawney’s classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying.
“She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him. He
had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. “Have
either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball?” he asked them unhappily.
“Nope,” said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry knew that he was
counting down the time until Buckbeak’s appeal started.
The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back
down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, “What did she ask? Was it okay?”
But they all refused to say.
“She says the crystal ball’s told her that if I tell you, I’ll have a horrible accident!” squeaked
Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the
landing.
“That’s convenient,” snorted Ron. “You know, I’m starting to think Hermione was right about
her” — he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead — “she’s a right old fraud.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was now two o’clock. “Wish she’d hurry up…”
Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.
“She says I’ve got all the makings of a true Seer,” she informed Harry and Ron. “I saw loads of
stuff…Well, good luck!”
She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.
“Ronald Weasley,” said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry
and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He
settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny
window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.
Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron’s large feet reappeared on the ladder.
“How’d it go?” Harry asked him, standing up.
“Rubbish,” said Ron. “Couldn’t see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don’t think she was
convinced, though…”
“Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney’s voice called, “Harry
Potter!”
The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the
usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where
Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.
“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would kindly gaze into the Orb…Take your time,
now…then tell me what you see within it…”
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him
something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.
“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. “What do you see?”
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from
the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend.
“Er —” said Harry, “a dark shape…um…”
“What does it resemble?” whispered Professor Trelawney. “Think, now…”
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
“A Hippogriff,” he said firmly.
“Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her
knees. “My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of
Magic! Look closer…Does the Hippogriff appear to…have its head?”
“Yes,” said Harry firmly.
“Are you sure?” Professor Trelawney urged him. “Are you quite sure, dear? You don’t see it
writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?”
“No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.
“No blood? No weeping Hagrid?”
“No!” said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat. “It looks fine,
it’s — flying away…”
Professor Trelawney sighed.
“Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there…A little disappointing…but I’m sure you did your best.”
Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke
behind him.
“IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT.”
Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair; her eyes were
unfocused and her mouth sagging.
“S — sorry?” said Harry.
But Professor Trelawney didn’t seem to hear him. Her eyes started to roll. Harry sat there in a
panic. She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of
running to the hospital wing — and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same harsh voice,
quite unlike her own:
“THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS
FOLLOWERS. HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT,
BEFORE MIDNIGHT…THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS
MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANT’S AID, GREATER AND
MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT…BEFORE MIDNIGHT…THE
SERVANT…WILL SET OUT…TO REJOIN…HIS MASTER…”
Professor Trelawney’s head fell forward onto her chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry
sat there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor Trelawney’s head snapped up again.
“I’m so sorry, dear boy,” she said dreamily, “the heat of the day, you know…I drifted off for a
moment…”
Harry sat there, staring at her.
“Is there anything wrong, my dear?”
“You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord’s going to rise again…that his servant’s
going to go back to him.”
Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.
“The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that’s hardly something to joke
about…Rise again, indeed —”
“But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord —”
“I think you must have dozed off too, dear!” said Professor Trelawney. “I would certainly not
presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched as that!”
Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase, wondering…had he just heard
Professor Trelawney make a real prediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to
the test?
Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor
Tower, Professor Trelawney’s words still resounding in his head. People were striding past him in
the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited
freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost
deserted. Over in the corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.
“Professor Trelawney,” Harry panted, “just told me —”
But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.
“Buckbeak lost,” said Ron weakly. “Hagrid’s just sent this.”
Hagrid’s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so
much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.
Lost appeal. They’re going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do. Don’t come down. I don’t want
you to see it.
Hagrid
“We’ve got to go,” said Harry at once. “He can’t just sit there on his own, waiting for the
executioner!”
“Sunset, though,” said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way. “We’d
never be allowed…’specially you, Harry…”
Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking.
“If we only had the Invisibility Cloak…”
“Where is it?” said Hermione.
Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch.
“…if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m in serious trouble,” he finished.
“That’s true,” said Hermione, getting to her feet. “If he sees you…How do you open the witch’s
hump again?”
“You — you tap it and say, ‘Dissendium,’” said Harry. “But —”
Hermione didn’t wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the room, pushed open the
Fat Lady’s portrait and vanished from sight.
“She hasn’t gone to get it?” Ron said, staring after her.
She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully
under her robes.
“Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten, into you lately!” said Ron, astounded. “First you hit
Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney —”
Hermione looked rather flattered.
They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to Gryffindor Tower
afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to
hide the lump. They skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were
sure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming.
Hermione poked her head around the door.
“Okay,” she whispered, “no one there — cloak on —”
Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe
beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds. The sun was already
sinking behind the Forbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees.
They reached Hagrid’s cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering, and when he did, he
looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced and trembling.
“It’s us,” Harry hissed. “We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.”
“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid
shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak.
Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He looked like a man who
did not know where he was or what to do. This helplessness was worse to watch than tears.
“Wan’ some tea?” he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle.
“Where’s Buckbeak, Hagrid?” said Hermione hesitantly.
“I — I took him outside,” said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug.
“He’s tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he oughta see the trees an’ — an’ smell fresh air —
before —”
Hagrid’s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all
over the floor.
“I’ll do it, Hagrid,” said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess.
“There’s another one in the cupboard,” Hagrid said, sitting down and wiping his forehead on his
sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.
“Isn’t there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?” Harry asked fiercely, sitting down next to him.
“Dumbledore —”
“He’s tried,” said Hagrid. “He’s got no power ter overrule the Committee. He told ‘em
Buckbeak’s all right, but they’re scared…Yeh know what Lucius Malfoy’s like…threatened ‘em, I
expect…an’ the executioner, Macnair, he’s an old pal o’ Malfoy’s…but it’ll be quick an’ clean…an’
I’ll be beside him…”
Hagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of
hope or comfort.
“Dumbledore’s gonna come down while it — while it happens. Wrote me this mornin’. Said he
wants ter — ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore…”
Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid’s cupboard for another milk jug, let out a small,
quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the new jug in her hands, fighting back tears.
“We’ll stay with you too, Hagrid,” she began, but Hagrid shook his shaggy head.
“Yeh’re ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don’ wan’ yeh watchin’. An’ yeh shouldn’ be
down here anyway…If Fudge an’ Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh’ll be in
big trouble.”
Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione’s face, but she hid them from Hagrid, bustling
around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a
shriek.
“Ron, I don’t believe it — it’s Scabbers!”
Ron gaped at her.
“What are you talking about?”
Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down. With a frantic
squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.
“Scabbers!” said Ron blankly. “Scabbers, what are you doing here?”
He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was
thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in
Ron’s hands as though desperate to free himself.
“It’s okay, Scabbers!” said Ron. “No cats! There’s nothing here to hurt you!”
Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally ruddy face had gone the
color of parchment.
“They’re comin’…”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down the distant
castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him
trotted Cornelius Fudge. Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner,
Macnair.
“Yeh gotta go,” said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. “They mustn’ find yeh here…Go
now…”
Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak. “I’ll let yeh out the
back way,” said Hagrid.
They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more
so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind Hagrid’s pumpkin patch.
Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side
and pawed the ground nervously.
“It’s okay, Beaky,” said Hagrid softly. “It’s okay…” He turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
“Go on,” he said. “Get goin’.”
But they didn’t move.
“Hagrid, we can’t —”
“We’ll tell them what really happened —”
“They can’t kill him —”
“Go!” said Hagrid fiercely. “It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’ all!”
They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the
front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight.
“Go quick,” he said hoarsely. “Don’ listen…”
And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.
Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid’s
house. As they reached the other side, the front door closed with a sharp snap.
“Please, let’s hurry,” Hermione whispered. “I can’t stand it, I can’t bear it…”
They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had
turned to a clear, purple-tinged gray, but to the west there was a ruby-red glow.
Ron stopped dead.
“Oh, please, Ron,” Hermione began.
“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put —”
Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was going berserk;
squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth into Ron’s hand.
“Scabbers, it’s me, you idiot, it’s Ron,” Ron hissed.
They heard a door open behind them and men’s voices.
“Oh, Ron, please let’s move, they’re going to do it!” Hermione breathed.
“Okay — Scabbers, stay put —”
They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices
behind them. Ron stopped again.
“I can’t hold him — Scabbers, shut up, everyone’ll hear us —”
The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from
Hagrid’s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then, without warning,
the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe.
Hermione swayed on the spot.
“They did it!” she whispered to Harry. “I’d — don’t believe it — they did it!”
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
CAT, RAT, AND DOG
Harry’s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood transfixed with horror under
the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long-
shadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.
“Hagrid,” Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he made to turn back,
but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.
“We can’t,” said Ron, who was paper-white. “He’ll be in worse trouble if they know we’ve been
to see him…”
Hermione’s breathing was shallow and uneven.
“How — could — they?” she choked. “How could they?”
“Come on,” said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.
They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak.
The light was fading fast now.
By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell around them.
“Scabbers, keep still,” Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest. The rat was wriggling
madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket. “What’s the
matter with you, You stupid rat? Stay still — OUCH! He bit me!”
“Ron, be quiet!” Hermione whispered urgently. “Fudge’ll be out here in a minute —”
“He won’t — stay — put —”
Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might, trying to break free of Ron’s
grip.
“What’s the matter with him?”
But Harry had just seen — stinking toward them, his body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes
glinting eerily in the darkness — Crookshanks. Whether he could see them or was following the
sound of Scabbers’s squeaks, Harry couldn’t tell.
“Crookshanks!” Hermione moaned. “No, go away, Crookshanks! Go away!”
But the cat was getting nearer —
“Scabbers — NO!”
Too late — the rat had slipped between Ron’s clutching fingers, hit the ground, and scampered
away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him, and before Harry or Hermione could stop him,
Ron had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.
“Ron!” Hermione moaned.
She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it was impossible to run full out
under the cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after
Ron; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.
“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here —”
There was a loud thud.
“Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat —”
Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was
sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the
quivering lump.
“Ron — come on back under the cloak —” Hermione panted. “Dumbledore — the Minister —
they’ll be coming back out in a minute—”
But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they
heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws…Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a
shadow — an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog.
Harry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog had made an enormous leap and the front
paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw
inch-long teeth —
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs
were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new
attack.
Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside; the dog’s jaws
fastened instead around Ron’s outstretched arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the
brute’s hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll —
Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet
again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.
Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes “Lumos!” he whispered.
The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow
of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping
backward and forward to stop them going nearer.
And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the
roots — Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight —
“Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and
he was forced backward again.
All they could see now was one of Ron’s legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to
stop the dog from pulling him farther underground — but a horrible crack cut the air like a
gunshot; Ron’s leg had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.
“Harry — we’ve got to go for help —” Hermione gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had
cut her across the shoulder.
“No! That thing’s big enough to eat him; we haven’t got time —”
“Harry — we’re never going to get through without help —”
Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.
“If that dog can get in, we can,” Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way
through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn’t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without
being in range of the tree’s blows.
“Oh, help, help,” Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly on the spot, “Please…”
Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and
placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.
Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched
or shook.
“Crookshanks!” Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry’s arm painfully hard.
“How did he know —?”
“He’s friends with that dog,” said Harry grimly. “I’ve seen them together. Come on — and keep
your wand out —”
They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had reached the gap in the
roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled
forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel.
Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry’s wand. Seconds
later, Hermione slithered down beside him.
“Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice.
“This way,” said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.
“Where does this tunnel come out?” Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him.
“I don’t know…It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map but Fred and George said no one’s ever
gotten into it…It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade…”
They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them, Crookshanks’s tail bobbed
in and out of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as long as the one to
Honeydukes…All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to
him…He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch…
And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Ahead
Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening.
He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised their wands to see
what lay beyond.
It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the walls; there were stains
all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The
windows were all boarded up.
Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.
Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was deserted, but a door to their
right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm again. Her
wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows.
“Harry,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking Shack.”
Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large chunks had been torn
out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely.
“Ghosts didn’t do that,” he said slowly.
At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had moved upstairs. Both of them
looked up at the ceiling. Hermione’s grip on Harry’s arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his
fingers. He raised his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.
Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase. Everything
was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by
something being dragged upstairs.
They reached the dark landing.
“Nox,” they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out. Only one
door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then
a deep, loud purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod.
Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.
On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the
sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was
Ron.
Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.
“Ron — are you okay?”
“Where’s the dog?”
“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. “Harry, it’s a trap —”
“What —”
“He’s the dog…he’s an Animagus.”
Ron was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap, the man in the
shadows closed the door behind them.
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn’t been shining out of the deep,
dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of
his face, it looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius Black.
“Expelliarmus!” he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at them.
Harry’s and Hermione’s wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them.
Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on Harry.
“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said hoarsely.
His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it. “Your father would have
done the same for me. Brave of you not to run for a teacher. I’m grateful…it will make everything
much easier…”
The taunt about his father rang in Harry’s ears as though Black had bellowed it. A boiling hate
erupted in Harry’s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand
back in his hand, not to defend himself, but to attack…to kill. Without knowing what he was doing,
he started forward, but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands
grabbed him and held him back…“No, Harry!” Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron,
however, spoke to Black.
“If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us too!” he said fiercely, though the effort of
standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.
Something flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes.
“Lie down,” he said quietly to Ron. “You will damage that leg even more.”
“Did you hear me?” Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright.
“You’ll have to kill all three of us!”
“There’ll be only one murder here tonight,” said Black, and his grin widened.
“Why’s that?” Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and Hermione. “Didn’t care last
time, did you? Didn’t mind slaughtering all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew…What’s the matter,
gone soft in Azkaban?”
“Harry!” Hermione whimpered. “Be quiet!”
“HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!” Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of
Hermione’s and Ron’s restraint and lunged forward —
He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen,
whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man — all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as
badly as he could and that he didn’t care how much he got hurt in return —
Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn’t raise the wands in
time — one of Harry’s hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the
knuckles of Harry’s other hand collided with the side of Black’s head and they fell, backward, into
the wall —
Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black’s
hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry’s face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm
under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it
could find.
But Black’s free hand had found Harry’s throat
“No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long —”
The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.
Then he saw Hermione’s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain;
Ron had thrown himself on Black’s wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter —
He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw
himself toward it but
“Argh!”
Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry’s
arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted toward Harry’s wand —
“NO YOU DON’T!” roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap
aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned —
“Get out of the way!” he shouted at Ron and Hermione.
They didn’t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside,
snatching up her and Ron’s wands. Ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting,
his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.
Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched
Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black’s heart.
“Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered.
Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black’s chest, looking down at him. A
livid bruise was rising around Black’s left eye and his nose was bleeding.
“You killed my parents,” said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.
Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.
“I don’t deny it,” he said very quietly. “But if you knew the whole story.”
“The whole story?” Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. “You sold them to
Voldemort. That’s all I need to know.”
“You’ve got to listen to me,” Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now.
“You’ll regret it if you don’t…You don’t understand…”
“I understand a lot better than you think,” said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever. “You
never heard her, did you? My mum…trying to stop Voldemort killing me…and you did that…you
did it…”
Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked past Harry;
Crookshanks leapt onto Black’s chest and settled himself there, right over Black’s heart. Black
blinked and looked down at the cat.
“Get off,” he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.
But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black’s robes and wouldn’t shift. He turned his ugly,
squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione
gave a dry sob.
Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the wand. So what if he
had to kill the cat too? It was in league with Black…If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black,
that wasn’t Harry’s business…If Black wanted to save it, that only proved he cared more for
Crookshanks than for Harry’s parents…
Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment to avenge his
mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill Black. This was his chance…
The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised, Black staring up at
him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron’s ragged breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was
quite silent.
And then came a new sound —
Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor — someone was moving downstairs.
“WE’RE UP HERE!” Hermione screamed suddenly. “WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK
— QUICK!”
Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry gripped his wand
convulsively — Do it now! said a voice in his head — but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs
and Harry still hadn’t done it.
The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as
Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes
flickered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry, standing
there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at Harry’s
feet.
“Expelliarmus!” Lupin shouted.
Harry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding. Lupin
caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying
protectively across his chest.
Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn’t done it. His nerve had failed him. Black
was going to be handed back to the Dementors.
Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.
“Where is he, Sirius?”
Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn’t understand what Lupin meant. Who was Lupin
talking about? He turned to look at Black again.
Black’s face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn’t move at all. Then, very slowly,
he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who
looked bewildered.
“But then…” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his
mind, “…why hasn’t he shown himself before now? Unless” — Lupin’s eyes suddenly widened, as
though he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, “— unless he
was the one…unless you switched…without telling me?”
Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin’s face, Black nodded.
“Professor,” Harry interrupted loudly, “what’s going on —?”
But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin
was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black. The Professor walked to Black’s side, seized his hand,
pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a brother.
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.
“I DON’T BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed.
Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at
Lupin, wild-eyed. “You — you —”
“Hermione —”
“– you and him!”
“Hermione, calm down —”
“I didn’t tell anyone!” Hermione shrieked. “I’ve been covering up for you —”
“Hermione, listen to me, please” Lupin shouted. “I can explain —”
Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury.
“I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of control, “and all the time you’ve
been his friend!”
“You’re wrong,” said Lupin. “I haven’t been Sirius’s friend, but I am now — Let me explain…”
“NO!” Hermione screamed. “Harry, don’t trust him, he’s been helping Black get into the castle,
he wants you dead too — he’s a werewolf!”
There was a ringing silence. Everyone’s eyes were now on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm,
though rather pale.
“Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he said. “Only one out of three, I’m afraid. I
have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don’t want Harry dead.” An odd
shiver passed over his face. “But I won’t deny that I am a werewolf.”
Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made
toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, “Get away from me, werewolf!”
Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione and said, “How long
have you known?”
“Ages,” Hermione whispered. “Since I did Professor Snape’s essay…”
“He’ll be delighted,” said Lupin coolly. “He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize
what my symptoms meant…Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full
moon? Or did you realize that the Boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?”
“Both,” Hermione said quietly.
Lupin forced a laugh.
“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met, Hermione.”
“I’m not,” Hermione whispered. “If I’d been a bit cleverer, I’d have told everyone what you are!”
“But they already know,” said Lupin. “At least, the staff do.”
“Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf,” Ron gasped. “Is he mad?”
“Some of the staff thought so,” said Lupin. “He had to work very hard to convince certain
teachers that I’m trustworthy —”
“AND HE WAS WRONG!” Harry yelled. “YOU’VE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE
TIME!”
He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his face
hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring.
Ron edged away from both of them, dragging his leg.
“I have not been helping Sirius,” said Lupin. “If you’ll give me a chance, I’ll explain. Look —”
He separated Harry’s, Ron’s and Hermione’s wands and threw each back to its owner; Harry
caught his, stunned.
“There,” said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt “You’re armed, we’re not. Now
will you listen?”
Harry didn’t know what to think. Was it a trick?
“If you haven’t been helping him,” he said, with a furious glance at Black, “how did you know
he was here?”
“The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in my office examining it —”
“You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously.
“Of course I know how to work it,” said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently. “I helped write it.
I’m Moony — that was my friends’ nickname for me at school.”
“You wrote —?”
“The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you,
Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his Hippogriff was
executed. And I was right, wasn’t I?”
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust rose at his feet.
“You might have been wearing your father’s old cloak, Harry—”
“How d’you know about the cloak?”
“The number of times I saw James disappearing under it…” said Lupin, waving an impatient
hand again. “The point is, even if you’re wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the
Marauder’s Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes later,
you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by somebody
else.”
“What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t!”
“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry’s interruption. “I
thought the map must be malfunctioning. How could he be with you?”
“No one was with us!” said Harry.
“And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius Black…I saw him collide
with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow —”
“One of us!” Ron said angrily.
“No, Ron,” said Lupin. “Two of you.”
He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.
“Do you think I could have a look at the rat?” he said evenly.
“What?” said Ron. “What’s Scabbers got to do with it?”
“Everything,” said Lupin. “Could I see him, please?”
Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron
had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black’s leg and made a
soft hissing noise.
Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.
“What?” Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. “What’s my rat got to
do with anything?”
“That’s not a rat,” croaked Sirius Black suddenly.
“What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat —”
“No, he’s not,” said Lupin quietly. “He’s a wizard.”
“An Animagus,” said Black, “by the name of Peter Pettigrew.”
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS
It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry
was thinking.
“You’re both mental.”
“Ridiculous!” said Hermione faintly.
“Peter Pettigrew’s dead!” said Harry. “He killed him twelve years ago!” He pointed at Black,
whose face twitched convulsively.
“I meant to,” he growled, his yellow teeth bared, “but little Peter got the better of me…not this
time, though!”
And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as
Black’s weight fell on his broken leg.
“Sirius, NO!” Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron
again, “WAIT! You can’t do it just like that — they need to understand — we’ve got to explain —”
“We can explain afterwards!” snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still
clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron’s face
and neck as he tried to escape.
“They’ve — got — a — right — to — know — everything!” Lupin panted, still trying to
restrain Black. “Ron’s kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don’t understand, and Harry —
you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!”
Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was
clamped tightly under Ron’s bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands.
“All right, then,” Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat. “Tell them whatever you like.
But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for…”
“You’re nutters, both of you,” said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for
support. “I’ve had enough of this. I’m off.”
He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at
Scabbers.
“You’re going to hear me out, Ron,” he said quietly. “Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you
listen.”
“HE’S NOT PETER, HE’S SCABBERS!” Ron yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front
pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him
am pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.
“There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,” he said. “A whole street full of them…”
“They didn’t see what they thought they saw!” said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers
struggling in Ron’s hands.
“Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,” said Lupin, nodding. “I believed it myself — until I saw
the map tonight. Because the Marauder’s map never lies…Peter’s alive. Ron’s holding him, Harry.”
Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were
both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter
Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all — but why was Lupin playing along with
him?
Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will
Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.
“But Professor Lupin…Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew…it just can’t be true, you know it can’t…”
“Why can’t it be true?” Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had
simply spotted a problem in an experiment with Grindylows.
“Because…because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did
Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework —
the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there’s a register
showing what animal they become, and their markings and things…and I went and looked Professor
McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and
Pettigrew’s name wasn’t on the list.”
Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework,
when Lupin started to laugh.
“Right again, Hermione!” he said. “But the Ministry never knew that here used to be three
unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.”
“If you’re going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,” said Black, who was still watching
Scabbers’s every desperate move. “I’ve waited twelve years, I’m not going to wait much longer.”
“All right…but you’ll need to help me, Sirius,” said Lupin, “I only know how it began…”
Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its
own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the
landing.
“No one there…”
“This place is haunted!” said Ron.
“It’s not,” said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. “The Shrieking Shack was never
haunted…The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.”
He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then said, “That’s where all of
this starts — with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn’t been
bitter…and if I hadn’t been so foolhardy…”
He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said, “Shh!” She was
watching Lupin very intently.
“I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days
there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent
discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the full moon, I keep
my mind when I transform…I’m able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the
moon to wane again.
“Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a
month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren’t likely
to want their children exposed to me.
“But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we
took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn’t come to school…” Lupin sighed, and
looked directly at Harry. “I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year
I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house” —
Lupin looked miserably around the room, — “the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my
use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was
placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.”
Harry couldn’t see where this story was going, but he was listening raptly all the same. The only
sound apart from Lupin’s voice was Scabbers’s frightened squeaking.
“My transformations in those days were — were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a
werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers
heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits.
Dumbledore encouraged the rumor…Even now, when the house has been silent for years, the
villagers don’t dare approach it…
“But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first
time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black…Peter Pettigrew…and, of course, your
father, Harry — James Potter.
“Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up
all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her…I was
terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you,
Hermione, worked out the truth…
“And they didn’t desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my
transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.”
“My dad too?” said Harry, astounded.
“Yes, indeed,” said Lupin. “It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it.
Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because
the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch
on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally,
in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.”
“But how did that help you?” said Hermione, sounding puzzled.
“They couldn’t keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,” said Lupin.
“A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James’s
Invisibility Cloak. They transformed…Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow’s
attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and
join me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind
seemed to become less so while I was with them.”
“Hurry up, Remus,” snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of
hunger on his face.
“I’m getting there, Sirius, I’m getting there…well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us
now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school
grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were
able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about
the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did…And that’s how we came to write the
Marauder’s Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was
Prongs.”
“What sort of animal —?” Harry began, but Hermione cut him off. “That was still really
dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you’d given the others the slip, and
bitten somebody?”
“A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily. “And there were near misses, many of
them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless — carried away with our
own cleverness.
“I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore’s trust, of course…he had admitted me to
Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the
rules he had set down for my own and others’ safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students
into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat
down to plan our next month’s adventure. And I haven’t changed…”
Lupin’s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. “All this year, I have been
battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But
I didn’t do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I’d betrayed
his trust while I was at school, admitting that I’d led others along with me…and Dumbledore’s trust
has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have
been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced
myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being
an Animagus had nothing to do with it…so, in a way, Snape’s been right about me all along.”
“Snape?” said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first time in minutes and
looking up at Lupin. “What’s Snape got to do with it?”
“He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin heavily. “He’s teaching here as well.” He looked up at Harry,
Ron, and Hermione.
“Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the
Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be
trusted. He has his reasons…you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a
trick which involved me —”
Black made a derisive noise.
“It served him right,” he sneered. “Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up
to…hoping he could get us expelled…”
“Severus was very interested in where I went every month.” Lupin told Harry, Ron, and
Hermione. “We were in the same year, you know, and we — er — didn’t like each other very much.
He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James’s talent on the Quidditch field…anyway
Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the
Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be — er — amusing, to tell Snape all he
had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he’d be able to get in after me.
Well, of course, Snape tried it — if he’d got as far as this house, he’d have met a fully grown
werewolf — but your father, who’d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him
back, at great risk to his life…Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was
forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was…”
“So that’s why Snape doesn’t like you,” said Harry slowly, “because he thought you were in on
the joke?”
“That’s right,” sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.
Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin.
CHAPTER NINETEEN
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT
Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he’d received a huge electric
shock.
“I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,” said Snape, throwing the cloak aside,
careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin’s chest. “Very useful, Potter, I thank you…”
Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. “You’re wondering,
perhaps, how I knew you were here?” he said, his eyes glittering. “I’ve just been to your office,
Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I
did…lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I
needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.”
“Severus —” Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.
“I’ve told the headmaster again and again that you’re helping your old friend Black into the
castle, Lupin, and here’s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old
place as your hideout —”
“Severus, you’re making a mistake,” said Lupin urgently. “You haven’t heard everything — I can
explain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry —”
“Two more for Azkaban tonight,” said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. “I shall be
interested to see how Dumbledore takes this…He was quite convinced you were harmless, you
know, Lupin…a tame werewolf —”
“You fool,” said Lupin softly. “Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside
Azkaban?”
BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape’s wand and twisted themselves
around Lupin’s mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move.
With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between
Black’s eyes.
“Give me a reason,” he whispered. “Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.”
Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred.
Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at
Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the
struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very
breathless voice, “Professor Snape — it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve got to say, w-would it?”
“Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,” Snape spat. “You, Potter,
and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once
in your life, hold your tongue.”
“But if — if there was a mistake —”
“KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged.
“DON’T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND!” A few sparks shot out of the
end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black’s face. Hermione fell silent.
“Vengeance is very sweet,” Snape breathed at Black. “How I hoped I would be the one to catch
you…”
“The joke’s on you again, Severus,” Black snarled. “As long as this boy brings his rat up to the
castle” — he jerked his head at Ron — “I’ll come quietly…”
“Up to the castle?” said Snape silkily. “I don’t think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call
the Dementors once we get out of the Willow. They’ll be very pleased to see you, Black…pleased
enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay…I —”
What little color there was in Black’s face left it.
“You — you’ve got to hear me out,” he croaked. “The rat — look at the rat —”
But there was a mad glint in Snape’s eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond
reason.
“Come on, all of you,” he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound
Lupin flew to his hands. “I’ll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the Dementors will have a kiss for him too
—”
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the
door.
“Get out of the way, Potter, you’re in enough trouble already,” snarled Snape. “If I hadn’t been
here to save your skin —”
“Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,” Harry said. “I’ve been
alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the Dementors. If he was helping
Black, why didn’t he just finish me off then?”
“Don’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf’s mind works,” hissed Snape. “Get out of the way,
Potter.”
“YOU’RE PATHETIC!” Harry yelled. “JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU
AT SCHOOL YOU WON’T EVEN LISTEN —”
“SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!” Snape shrieked, looking madder
than ever. “Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on
bended knee! You would have been well served if he’d killed you! You’d have died like your father,
too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way, or I will make
you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!”
Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he
had raised his wand.
“Expelliarmus!” he yelled — except that his wasn’t the only voice that shouted. There was a blast
that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then
slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out.
Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same
moment. Snape’s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.
“You shouldn’t have done that,” said Black, looking at Harry. “You should have left him to
me…”
Harry avoided Black’s eyes. He wasn’t sure, even now, that he’d done the right thing.
“We attacked a teacher…We attacked a teacher…” Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless
Snape with frightened eyes. “Oh, we’re going to be in so much trouble —”
Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin
straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.
“Thank you, Harry,” he said.
“I’m still not saying I believe you,” he told Lupin.
“Then it’s time we offered you some proof,” said Lupin. “You, boy — give me Peter, please.
Now.”
Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.
“Come off it,” he said weakly. “Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his
hands on Scabbers? I mean…” He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, “Okay, say
Pettigrew could turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how’s he supposed to know which one
he is after if he was locked up in Azkaban?”
“You know, Sirius, that’s a fair question,” said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly.
“How did you find out where he was?”
Black put one of his claw-like hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper,
which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others.
It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous
summer, and there, on Ron’s shoulder, was Scabbers.
“How did you get this?” Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.
“Fudge,” said Black. “When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And
there was Peter, on the front page on this boy’s shoulder…I knew him at once…how many times
had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts…to
where Harry was…”
“My God,” said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again.
“His front paw…”
“What about it?” said Ron defiantly.
“He’s got a toe missing,” said Black.
“Of course,” Lupin breathed. “So simple…so brilliant…he cut it off himself?”
“Just before he transformed,” said Black. “When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to
hear that I’d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with
the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself — and sped down into the
sewer with the other rats…”
“Didn’t you ever hear, Ron?” said Lupin. “The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.”
“Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He’s been in my family for
ages, right —”
“Twelve years, in fact,” said Lupin. “Didn’t you ever wonder why he was living so long?”
“We — we’ve been taking good care of him!” said Ron.
“Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?” said Lupin. “I’d guess he’s been losing
weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again…”
“He’s been scared of that mad cat!” said Ron, nodding toward Crookshanks, who was still
purring on the bed.
But that wasn’t right, Harry thought suddenly…Scabbers had been looking ill before he met
Crookshanks…ever since Ron’s return from Egypt…since the time when Black had escaped…
“This cat isn’t mad,” said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked
Crookshanks’s fluffy head. “He’s the most intelligent of his kind I’ve ever met. He recognized Peter
for what he was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he
trusted me…Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he’s been helping
me…”
“What do you mean?” breathed Hermione.
“He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn’t…so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower
for me…As I understand it, he took them from a boy’s bedside table…”
Harry’s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing. It was absurd…and
yet…
“But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it.” croaked Black. “This cat —
Crookshanks, did you call him? — told me Peter had left blood on the sheets…I supposed he bit
himself…Well, faking his own death had worked once.”
These words jolted Harry to his senses.
“And why did he fake his death?” he said furiously. “Because he knew you were about to kill him
like you killed my parents!”
“No,” said Lupin, “Harry—”
“And now you’ve come to finish him off!”
“Yes, I have,” said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.
“Then I should’ve let Snape take you!” Harry shouted.
“Harry,” said Lupin hurriedly, “don’t you see? All this time we’ve thought Sirius betrayed your
parents, and Peter tracked him down — but it was the other way around, don’t you see? Peter
betrayed your mother and father — Sirius tracked Peter down —”
“THAT’S NOT TRUE!” Harry yelled. “HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO
BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!”
He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly over
bright.
“Harry…I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at
the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me…I’m to blame, I know
it…The night they died, I’d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I
arrived at his hiding place, he’d gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn’t feel right. I was
scared. I set out for your parents’ house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and
their bodies…I realized what Peter must’ve done…what I’d done…”
His voice broke. He turned away.
“Enough of this,” said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard
before. “There’s one certain way to prove what really happened. Ron, give me that rat.”
“What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?” Ron asked Lupin tensely.
“Force him to show himself,” said Lupin. “If he really is a rat, it won’t hurt him.”
Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to
squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. “Ready,
Sirius?” said Lupin.
Black had already retrieved Snape’s wand from the bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling
rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face.
“Together?” he said quietly.
“I think so”, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other. “On
the count of three. One — two — THREE!”
A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in
midair, his small gray form twisting madly — Ron yelled — the rat fell and hit the floor. There was
another blinding flash of light and then —
It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was shooting upward from the
ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was standing where Scabbers had been,
cringing and wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his
back was standing up.
He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was
unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man
who has lost a lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers’s fur, and
something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes. He looked
around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back
again.
“Well, hello, Peter,” said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school
friends around him. “Long time, no see.”
“S—Sirius…R—Remus…” Even Pettigrew’s voice was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward
the door. “My friends…my old friends…”
Black’s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning took, then
turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual.
“We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You
might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed —”
“Remus,” gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face,
“you don’t believe him, do you…? He tried to kill me, Remus…”
“So we’ve heard,” said Lupin, more coldly. “I’d like to clear up one or two little matters with
you, Peter, if you’ll be so —”
“He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry
saw that he used his middle finger, because his index was missing. “He killed Lily and James and
now he’s going to kill me too…You’ve got to help me, Remus…”
Black’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes.
“No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a few things out,” said Lupin.
“Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the
boarded windows and, again, the only door. “I knew he’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for
me! I’ve been waiting for this for twelve years!”
“You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?” said Lupin, his brow furrowed. “When
nobody has ever done it before?”
“He’s got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!” Pettigrew shouted shrilly. “How else did
he get out of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!”
Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the whole room.
“Voldemort, teach me tricks?” he said.
Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him.
“What, scared to hear your old master’s name?” said Black. “I don’t blame you, Peter. His lot
aren’t very happy with you, are they?”
“Don’t know what you mean, Sirius —” muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His
whole face was shining with sweat now.
“You haven’t been hiding from me for twelve years,” said Black. “You’ve been hiding from
Voldemort’s old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter…They all think you’re dead, or you’d
have to answer to them…I’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like
they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters’ on your
information…and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort’s supporters ended up
in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they’ve seen the
error of their ways. If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter —”
“Don’t know…what you’re talking about…” said Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He
wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. “You don’t believe this — this madness, Remus
—”
“I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to
spend twelve years as a rat,” said Lupin evenly.
“Innocent, but scared!” squealed Pettigrew. “If Voldemort’s supporters were after me, it was
because I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy, Sirius Black!”
Black’s face contorted.
“How dare you,” he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been. “I, a spy for
Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than
myself? But you, Peter — I’ll never understand why I didn’t see you were the spy from the start. You
always liked big friends who’d look after you, didn’t you? It used to be us…me and Remus…and
James…”
Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath.
“Me, a spy…must be out of your mind…never…don’t know how you can say such a —”
“Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,” Black hissed, so
venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. “I thought it was the perfect plan…a
bluff…Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they’d use a weak, talentless
thing like you…It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you
could hand him the Potters.”
Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like “far-fetched” and “lunacy,” but he
couldn’t help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew’s face and the way his eyes
continued to dart toward the windows and door.
“Professor Lupin?” said Hermione timidly. “Can — can I say something?”
“Certainly, Hermione,” said Lupin courteously.
“Well — Scabbers — I mean, this — this man — he’s been sleeping in Harry’s dormitory for
three years. If he’s working for You-Know-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before
now?”
“There!” said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand. “Thank you! You see,
Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry’s head! Why should I?”
“I’ll tell you why,” said Black. “Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see
what was in it for you. Voldemort’s been in hiding for fifteen years, they say he’s half dead. You
weren’t about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore’s nose, for a wreck of a wizard
who’d lost all of his power, were you? You’d want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the
playground before you went back to him, wouldn’t you? Why else did you find a wizard family to
take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren’t you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained
strength, and it was safe to rejoin him…”
Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to have lost the ability to
talk.
“Er — Mr. Black — Sirius?” said Hermione.
Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as though he had never seen
anything quite like her.
“If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn’t use Dark
Magic?”
“Thank you!” gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. “Exactly! Precisely what I —”
But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though
he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering his answer.
“I don’t know how I did it,” he said slowly. “I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that
I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of
me…but it kept me sane and knowing who I am…helped me keep my powers…so when it all
became…too much…I could transform in my cell…become a dog. Dementors can’t see, you
know…” He swallowed. “They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions…They
could tell that my feelings were less — less human, less complex when I was a dog…but they
thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there, so it didn’t trouble them.
But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand…
“But then I saw Peter in that picture…I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry…perfectly
positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again…”
Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as though
hypnotized.
“…ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies…and to deliver the last Potter to
them. If he gave them Harry, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord Voldemort? He’d be welcomed
back with honors…
“So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive…”
Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. “The guards say he’s been talking
in his sleep…always the same words…‘He’s at Hogwarts.’”
“It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the Dementors couldn’t destroy it…It wasn’t
a happy feeling…it was an obsession…but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night
when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog…It’s so much harder for
them to sense animal emotions that they were confused…I was thin, very thin…thin enough to slip
through the bars…I swam as a dog back to the mainland…I journeyed north and slipped into the
Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I’ve been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the
Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry…”
He looked at Harry, who did not look away.
“Believe me,” croaked Black. “Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James and Lily. I would have
died before I betrayed them.”
And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he nodded.
“No!”
Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry’s nod had been his own death sentence. He
shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his hands clasped in front of him as though praying.
“Sirius — it’s me…it’s Peter…your friend…you wouldn’t —”
Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.
“There’s enough filth on my robes without you touching them,” said Black.
“Remus!” Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing imploringly in front of him.
“You don’t believe this — wouldn’t Sirius have told you they’d changed the plan?”
“Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,” said Lupin. “I assume that’s why you didn’t tell me,
Sirius?” he said casually over Pettigrew’s head.
“Forgive me, Remus,” said Black.
“Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,” said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. “And will you,
in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?”
“Of course,” said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face. He, too, began
rolling up his sleeves. “Shall we kill him together?”
“Yes, I think so,” said Lupin grimly.
“You wouldn’t…you won’t…” gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled around to Ron.
“Ron…haven’t I been a good friend…a good pet? You won’t let them kill me, Ron, will
you…you’re on my side, aren’t you?”
But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.
“I let you sleep in my bed!” he said.
“Kind boy…kind master…” Pettigrew crawled toward Ron “You won’t let them do it…I was
your rat…I was a good pet…”
“If you made a better rat than a human, it’s not much to boast about, Peter,” said Black harshly.
Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew’s reach. Pettigrew
turned on his knees, staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione’s robes.
“Sweet girl…clever girl…you — you won’t let them…Help me…”
Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew’s clutching hands and backed away against the wall,
looking horrified.
Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned his head slowly toward Harry.
“Harry…Harry…you look just like your father…just like him…”
“HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?” roared Black. “HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM?
HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?”
“Harry,” whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched. “Harry, James
wouldn’t have wanted me killed…James would have understood, Harry…he would have shown me
mercy…”
Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew’s shoulders, and threw him backward
onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring up at them.
“You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,” said Black, who was shaking too. “Do you deny it?”
Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on
the floor.
“Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord…you have no idea…he has weapons you
can’t imagine…I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant
it to happen…He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me —”
“DON’T LIE!” bellowed Black. “YOU’D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR
A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!”
“He — he was taking over everywhere!” gasped Pettigrew. “Wh-what was there to be gained by
refusing him?”
“What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?” said Black,
with a terrible fury in his face. “Only innocent lives, Peter!”
“You don’t understand!” whined Pettigrew. “He would have killed me, Sirius!”
“THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!” roared Black. “DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY
YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!”
Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.
“You should have realized,” said Lupin quietly, “if Voldemort didn’t kill you, we would. Good-
bye, Peter.”
Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.
“NO!” Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew, facing the wands. “You
can’t kill him,” he said breathlessly. “You can’t.”
Black and Lupin both looked staggered.
“Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,” Black snarled. “This cringing bit
of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin
meant more to him than your whole family.”
“I know,” Harry panted. “We’ll take him up to the castle. We’ll hand him over to the
Dementors…He can go to Azkaban…but don’t kill him.”
“Harry!” gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry’s knees. “You — thank you —
it’s more than I deserve — thank you —”
“Get off me,” Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew’s hands off him in disgust. “I’m not doing this for
you. I’m doing it because — I don’t reckon my dad would’ve wanted them to become killers — just
for you.”
No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming in wheezes as he
clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each other. Then, with one movement, they
lowered their wands.
“You’re the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,” said Black. “But think…think what
he did…”
“He can go to Azkaban,” Harry repeated. “If anyone deserves that place, he does…”
Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.
“Very well,” said Lupin. “Stand aside, Harry.”
Harry hesitated.
“I’m going to tie him up,” said Lupin. “That’s all, I swear.”
Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin’s wand this time, and next moment,
Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged.
“But if you transform, Peter,” growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too, “we will
kill you. You agree, Harry?”
Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.
“Right,” said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. “Ron, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam
Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.”
He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.”
Bandages spun up Ron’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put
his weight gingerly on the leg and didn’t wince.
“That’s better,” he said. “Thanks.”
“What about Professor Snape?” said Hermione in a small voice, looking down at Snape’s prone
figure.
“There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his
pulse. “You were just a little — overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er — perhaps it will be best if we
don’t revive him until we’re safety back in the castle. We can take him like this…”
He muttered, “Mobilicorpus.” As though invisible strings were tied to Snape’s wrists, neck, and
knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet.
He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the Invisibility
Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket.
“And two of us should be chained to this,” said Black, nudging Pettigrew with his toe. “Just to
make sure.”
“I’ll do it,” said Lupin.
“And me,” said Ron savagely, limping forward.
Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained
to Lupin’s right, right arm to Ron’s left. Ron’s face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers’s true
identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room,
his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.
CHAPTER TWENTY
THE DEMENTOR’S KISS
Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin,
Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape,
drifting creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up by his own wand, which
was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione brought up the rear.
Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron had to turn sideways to
manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly
along the tunnel in single file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after Black, who
was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low
ceiling. Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to prevent this.
“You know what this means?” Black said abruptly to Harry as they made their slow progress
along the tunnel. “Turning Pettigrew in?”
“You’re free,” said Harry.
“Yes…” said Black. “But I’m also — I don’t know if anyone ever told you — I’m your
godfather.”
“Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry.
“Well…your parents appointed me your guardian,” said Black stiffly. “If anything happened to
them…”
Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant?
“I’ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle,” said Black.
“But…well…think about it. Once my name’s cleared…if you wanted a…a different home…”
Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry’s stomach.
“What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from
the ceiling. “Leave the Dursleys?”
“Of course, I thought you wouldn’t want to,” said Black quickly. “I understand, I just thought
I’d —”
“Are you insane?” said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Black’s. “Of course I want to leave the
Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in?”
Black turned right around to look at him; Snape’s head was scraping the ceiling but Black didn’t
seem to care.
“You want to?” he said. “You mean it?”
“Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry.
Black’s gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it. The difference it made
was startling, as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask; for a
moment, he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry’s parents’ wedding.
They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel. Crookshanks darted up
first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron
clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches.
Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and Hermione to pass. At last,
all of them were out.
The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle.
Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry’s
mind was buzzing. He was going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his
parents’ best friend…He felt dazed…What would happen when he told the Dursleys he was going
to live with the convict they’d seen on television…!
“One wrong move, Peter,” said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was still pointed sideways
at Pettigrew’s chest.
Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing slowly larger. Snape was still
drifting weirdly ahead of Black, his chin bumping on his chest. And then -
A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their party was bathed in
moonlight.
Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped abruptly. Black froze. He
flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.
Harry could see Lupin’s silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs began to shake.
“Oh, my —” Hermione gasped. “He didn’t take his potion tonight! He’s not safe!”
“Run,” Black whispered. “Run. Now.”
But Harry couldn’t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt forward but Black
caught him around the chest and threw him back.
“Leave it to me — RUN!”
There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin’s head was lengthening. So was his body. His
shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands, which were curling into
clawed paws. Crookshanks’s hair was on end again; he was backing away —
As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from Harry’s side. He had
transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of
the manacle binding it, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ron and
Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other.
Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to notice anything else. It was
Hermione’s scream that alerted him —
Pettigrew had dived for Lupin’s dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There
was a bang, a burst of light — and Ron lay motionless on the ground. Another bang —
Crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap.
“Expelliarmus.” Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew; Lupin’s wand flew high into
the air and out of sight. “Stay where you are!” Harry shouted, running forward.
Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron’s
outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass.
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was
galloping into the forest —
“Sirius, he’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” Harry yelled.
Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at Harry’s words he
scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away
across the grounds.
Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.
“What did he do to him?” Hermione whispered. Ron’s eyes were only half-closed, his mouth
hung open; he was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing, but he didn’t seem to recognize
them.
“I don’t know…”
Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone…they had no one but Snape for
company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair.
“We’d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,” said Harry, pushing his hair out of his
eyes, trying to think straight. “Come —”
But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a whining: a dog in
pain…
“Sirius,” Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.
He had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing they could do for Ron at the moment,
and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble —
Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to be coming from the
ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold
without realizing what it must mean -
The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw why — Sirius had turned
back into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands over his head.
“Nooo,” he moaned. “Nooo…please…”
And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding in a black mass
around the lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog
starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were
encircling them…
“Hermione, think of something happy!” Harry yelled, raising his wand, blinking furiously to try
and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it —
I’m going to live with my godfather. I’m leaving the Dursleys.
He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant: “Expecto patronum!
Expecto patronum!”
Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground, pale as death.
He’ll be all right. I’m going to go and live with him.
“Expecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum!”
“Expecto —” Hermione whispered, “expecto — expecto —”
But she couldn’t do it. The Dementors were closing in, barely ten feet from them. They formed
a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer…
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his ears.
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him. At the same moment,
Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He was alone…completely alone…
“Expecto — expecto patronum —”
Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes. With a huge effort, he fought
to remember — Sirius was innocent — innocent — We’ll be okay — I’m going to live with him —
“Expecto patronum!” he gasped.
By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a Dementor halt, very close to him. It
couldn’t walk through the cloud of silver mist Harry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from
under the cloak. It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.
“No — no —” Harry gasped. “He’s innocent…expecto expecto patronum —”
He could feet them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him. The
nearest Dementor seemed to be considering him. Then it raised both its rotting hands — and
lowered its hood.
Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly
over empty sockets. But there was a mouth…a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound
of a death rattle.
A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn’t move or speak. His Patronus flickered and
died.
White fog was blinding him. He had to fight…expecto patronum…he couldn’t see…and in the
distance, he heard the familiar screaming…expecto patronum…he groped in the mist for Sirius, and
found his arm…they weren’t going to take him…
But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry’s neck. They
were forcing his face upward…He could feel its breath…It was going to get rid of him first…He
could feel its putrid breath…His mother was screaming in his ears…She was going to be the last
thing he ever heard —
And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a silvery light growing
brighter and brighter…He felt himself fall forward onto the grass…Facedown, too weak to move,
sick and shaking, Harry opened his eyes. The Dementor must have released him. The blinding light
was illuminating the grass around him…The screaming had stopped, the cold was ebbing away…
Something was driving the Dementors back…It was circling around him and Black and
Hermione…They were leaving…
The air was warm again…
With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a few inches and saw an
animal amid the light, galloping away across the lake…Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make
out what it was…It was as bright as a unicorn…Fighting to stay conscious, Harry watched it can’ter
to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody
welcoming it back…raising his hand to pat it…someone who looked strangely familiar…but it
couldn’t be…
Harry didn’t understand. He couldn’t think anymore. He felt the last of his strength leave him,
and his head hit the ground as he fainted.
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
HERMIONE’S SECRET
“Shocking business…shocking…miracle none of them died…never heard the like…by thunder,
it was lucky you were there, Snape…”
“Thank you, Minister.”
“Order of Merlin, Second Class, I’d say. First Class, if I can wangle it!”
“Thank you very much indeed, Minister.”
“Nasty cut you’ve got there…Black’s work, I suppose?”
“As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister…”
“No!”
“Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to judge by their
behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent. They weren’t responsible for
their actions. On the other hand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape…They
obviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They’ve got away with a great deal
before now…I’m afraid it’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves…and of course Potter
has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster —”
“Ah, well, Snape…Harry Potter, you know…we’ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he’s
concerned.”
“And yet — is it good for him to be given so much special treatment? Personally, I try and treat
him like any other student. And any other student would be suspended — at the very least — for
leading his friends into such danger. Consider, Minister — against all school rules — after all the
precautions put in place for his protection — out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf
and a murderer — and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too —”
“Well, well…we shall see, Snape, we shall see…The boy has undoubtedly been foolish…”
Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The words he was hearing
seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so that it was difficult to
understand…His limbs felt like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift…He wanted to lie here, on this
comfortable bed, forever…
“What amazes me most is the behavior of the Dementors…you’ve really no idea what made
them retreat, Snape?”
“No, Minister…by the time I had come ‘round they were heading back to their positions at the
entrances…”
“Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl —”
“All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black, naturally, conjured
stretchers, and brought them all straight back to the castle.”
There was a pause. Harry’s brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing
sensation grew in the pit of his stomach…
He opened his eyes.
Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He was lying in the dark
hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to
him, bending over a bed. Harry squinted. Ron’s red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey’s arm.
Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay Hermione. Moonlight was
falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too. She looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry
was awake, pressed a finger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar, and the
voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from the corridor outside.
Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry’s bed. He turned to took
at her. She was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a
small boulder.
“Ah, you’re awake!” she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on Harry’s bedside table and
began breaking it apart with a small hammer.
“How’s Ron?” said Harry and Hermione together.
“He’ll live,” said Madam Pomfrey grimly. “As for you two, you’ll be staying here until I’m
satisfied you’re — Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”
Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his wand.
“I need to see the headmaster,” he said.
“Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, “it’s all right. They’ve got Black. He’s locked away
upstairs. The Dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now —”
“WHAT?”
Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout had been heard in the
corridor outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and Snape had entered the ward.
“Harry, Harry, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking agitated. “You should be in bed — has he had
any chocolate?” he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously.
“Minister, listen!” Harry said. “Sirius Black’s innocent! Peter Pettigrew faked his own death! We
saw him tonight! You can’t let the Dementors do that thing to Sirius, he’s —”
But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face.
“Harry, Harry, you’re very confused, you’ve been through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now,
we’ve got everything under control…”
“YOU HAVEN’T!” Harry yelled. “YOU’VE GOT THE WRONG MAN!”
“Minister, listen, please,” Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry’s side and was gazing
imploringly into Fudge’s face. “I saw him too. It was Ron’s rat, he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean,
and —”
“You see, Minister?” said Snape. “Confunded, both of them…Black’s done a very good job on
them…”
“WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED!” Harry roared.
“Minister! Professor!” said Madam Pomfrey angrily. “I must insist that you leave. Potter is my
patient, and he should not be distressed!”
“I’m not distressed, I’m trying to tell them what happened!” Harry said furiously. “If they’d just
listen —”
But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into Harry”s mouth; he
choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.
“Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave.”
The door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with
great difficulty and got up again.
“Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black —”
“For heaven’s sake!” said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. “Is this a hospital wing or not?
Headmaster, I must insist —”
“My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss Granger,” said Dumbledore
calmly. “I have just been talking to Sirius Black —”
“I suppose he’s told you the same fairy tale he’s planted in Potter’s mind?” spat Snape.
“Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive —”
“That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said Dumbledore, surveying Snape closely through his half-
moon spectacles.
“And does my evidence count for nothing?” snarled Snape. “Peter Pettigrew was not in the
Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds.”
“That was because you were knocked out, Professor!” said Hermione earnestly. “You didn’t
arrive in time to hear.”
“Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!”
“Now, Snape,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is disturbed in her mind, we must make
allowances —”
“I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” said Dumbledore abruptly. “Cornelius,
Severus, Poppy — please leave us.”
“Headmaster!” sputtered Madam Pomfrey. “They need treatment, they need rest —”
“This cannot wait,” said Dumbledore. “I must insist.”
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward,
slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his
waistcoat.
“The Dementors should have arrived by now,” he said. “I’ll go and meet them. Dumbledore, I’ll
see you upstairs.”
He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn’t moved.
“You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?” Snape whispered, his eyes fixed on
Dumbledore’s face.
“I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” Dumbledore repeated.
Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.
“Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,” he breathed. “You haven’t
forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven’t forgotten that he once tried to kill me?”
“My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly.
Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still holding. It closed
behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione. They both burst into speech at the
same time.
“Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we saw Pettigrew — he escaped when Professor Lupin
turned into a werewolf —”
“— he’s a rat —”
“— Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off —”
“— Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn’t Sirius —”
But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations.
“It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time,” he
said quietly. “There is not a shred of proof to support Black’s story, except your word — and the
word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore
they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the
Potters’ Secret-Keeper.”
“Professor Lupin can tell you —” Harry said, unable to stop himself
“Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is
human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so
mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little and the fact that he and
Sirius are old friends —”
“But —”
“Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see that Professor Snape’s
version of events is far more convincing than yours.”
“He hates Sirius,” Hermione said desperately. “All because of some stupid trick Sirius played on
him —”
“Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor
Tower with a knife — without Pettigrew, alive or dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius’s
sentence.”
“But you believe us.”
“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore quietly. “But I have no power to make other men see the truth, or
to overrule the Minister of Magic…”
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling
sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had
expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no…their last hope was
gone.
“What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to
Hermione, “is more time.”
“But —” Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. “OH!”
“Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very clearly. “Sirius is locked in
Professor Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West
Tower. If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But remember
this, both of you: you must not be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law — you know what is at
stake…You — must — not — be —seen.”
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked
back as he reached the door.
“I am going to lock you in. It is —” he consulted his watch, “five minutes to midnight. Miss
Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.”
“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore. “Three turns? What’s he
talking about? What are we supposed to do?”
But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling from beneath them a very long,
very fine gold chain.
“Harry, come here,” she said urgently. “Quick!”
Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She was holding the chain out. He saw a tiny,
sparkling hourglass hanging from it.
“Here —”
She had thrown the chain around his neck too.
“Ready?” she said breathlessly.
“What are we doing?” Harry said, completely lost.
Hermione turned the hourglass over three times.
The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast, backward. A blur
of colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears were pounding, he tried to yell but couldn’t hear his
own voice —
And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into focus again —
He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight
was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione,
the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck.
“Hermione, what —?”
“In here!” Hermione seized Harry’s arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom
closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and mops, then slammed the door
behind them.
“What — how — Hermione, what happened?”
“We’ve gone back in time,” Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off Harry’s neck in the
darkness. “Three hours back…”
Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot, which seemed to rule out
the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream.
“But —”
“Shh! Listen! Someone’s coming! I think — I think it might be us!” Hermione had her ear
pressed against the cupboard door.
“Footsteps across the hall…yes, I think it’s us going down to Hagrid’s!”
“Are you telling me,” Harry whispered, “that we’re here in this cupboard and we’re out there
too?”
“Yes,” said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. “I’m sure it’s us. It doesn’t sound
like more than three people…and we’re walking slowly because we’re under the Invisibility Cloak— ”
She broke off, still listening intently.
“We’ve gone down the front steps…”
Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious, but Harry wanted a
few questions answered.
“Where did you get that hourglass thing?”
“It’s called a Time-Turner,” Hermione whispered, “and I got it from Professor McGonagall on
our first day back. I’ve been using it all year to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me
swear I wouldn’t tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could
have one. She had to tell them that I was a model student, and that I’d never, ever use it for anything
except my studies…I’ve been turning it back so I could do hours over again, that’s how I’ve been
doing several lessons at once, see? But…
“Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he tell us to go back
three hours? How’s that going to help Sirius?”
Harry stared at her shadowy face.
“There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change,” he said slowly.
“What happened? We were walking down to Hagrid’s three hours ago…”
“This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid’s,” said Hermione. “We just heard
ourselves leaving…”
Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration.
“Dumbledore just said — just said we could save more than one innocent life…” And then it hit
him. “Hermione, we’re going to save Buckbeak!”
“But — how will that help Sirius?”
“Dumbledore said — he just told us where the window is — the window of Flitwick’s office!
Where they’ve got Sirius locked up! We’ve got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius!
Sirius can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together!”
From what Harry could see of Hermione’s face, she looked terrified.
“If we manage that without being seen, it’ll be a miracle!”
“Well, we’ve got to try, haven’t we?” said Harry. He stood up and pressed his ear against the
door. “Doesn’t sound like anyone’s there…Come on, let’s go.”
Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As quietly and quickly as
they could, they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps. The shadows were already
lengthening, the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.
“If anyone’s looking out of the window —” Hermione squeaked, looking up at the castle behind
them.
“We’ll run for it,” said Harry determinedly. “Straight into the forest, all right? We’ll have to hide
behind a tree or something and keep a lookout —”
“Okay, but we’ll go around by the greenhouses!’ said Hermione breathlessly. “We need to keep
out of sight of Hagrid’s front door, or we’ll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid’s by now!”
Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione behind him. They tore
across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a moment behind them, then set off
again, fast as they could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the
forest…
Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside
him, panting.
“Right,” she gasped. “We need to sneak over to Hagrid’s…Keep out of sight, Harry…”
They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as
they glimpsed the front of Hagrid’s house, they heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly
behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway,
shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry heard his own voice.
“It’s us. We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.”
“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the door quickly.
“This is the weirdest thing we’ve ever done,” Harry said fervently.
“Let’s move along a bit,” Hermione whispered. “We need to get nearer to Buckbeak!”
They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous Hippogriff, tethered to the fence around
Hagrid’s pumpkin patch.
“Now?” Harry whispered.
“No!” said Hermione. “If we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him
free! We’ve got to wait until they’ve seen he’s tied outside!”
“That’s going to give us about sixty seconds,” said Harry. This was starting to seem impossible.
At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid’s cabin.
“That’s Hagrid breaking the milk jug,” Hermione whispered. “I’m going to find Scabbers in a
moment —”
Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione’s shriek of surprise.
“Hermione,” said Harry suddenly, “what if we — we just run in there and grab Pettigrew —”
“No!” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Don’t you understand? We’re breaking one of the
most important wizarding laws! Nobody’s supposed to change time, nobody! You heard
Dumbledore, if we’re seen —”
“We’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!”
“Harry, what do you think you’d do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid’s house?” said
Hermione.
“I’d — I’d think I’d gone mad,” said Harry, “or I’d think there was some Dark Magic going on
—”
“Exactly! You wouldn’t understand, you might even attack yourself! Don’t you see? Professor
McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with
time…Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake!”
“Okay!” said Harry. “It was just an idea, I just thought —”
But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to
get a clear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and
Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps.
“We’re about to come out!” Hermione breathed.
And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid’s back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and
Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life,
standing behind the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.
“It’s Okay, Beaky, it’s okay…” Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and
Hermione. “Go on. Get goin’.”
“Hagrid, we can’t —”
“We’ll tell them what really happened —”
“They can’t kill him —”
“Go! It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’ all!”
Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and
Ron.
“Go quick. Don’ listen…”
There was a knock on Hagrid’s front door. The execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned,
around and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in
patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had
gone…but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside
the cabin through the back door.
“Where is the beast?” came the cold voice of Macnair.
“Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked.
Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face appeared at Hagrid’s window, staring out at
Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.
“We — er — have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I’ll make it quick. And
then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, You’re supposed to listen too, that’s procedure--”
Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now or never.
“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”
As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the
pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the Hippogriff
Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown—”
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce orange eyes once more and bowed.
Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of
rope tying Buckbeak to the fence.
“…sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the Committee’s appointed
executioner, Walden Macnair…”
“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on, we’re going to help you.
Quietly…quietly…”
“…as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here…”
Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front feet.
“Well, let’s get this over with,” said the reedy voice of the Committee member from inside
Hagrid’s cabin. “Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside —”
“No, I — I wan’ ter be with him…I don’ wan’ him ter be alone —”
Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.
“Buckbeak, move!” Harry hissed.
Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s neck. The Hippogriff began to walk,
rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid’s
back door.
“One moment, please, Macnair,” came Dumbledore’s voice. “You need to sign too.” The
footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster.
Hermione’s white face was sticking out from behind a tree.
“Harry, hurry!” she mouthed.
Harry could still hear Dumbledore’s voice talking from within the cabin. He gave the rope
another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had reached the trees…
“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and
adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now
blocked from sight; they couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.
“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear us.”
Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still;
even the Hippogriff seemed to be listening intently. Silence…then —
“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member. “Where is the beast?”
“It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I saw it! Just here!”
“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in his voice.
“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily.
There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner seemed to have swung it
into the fence in anger. And then came the howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid’s words
through his sobs.
“Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he’s gone! Musta pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!”
Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione
tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him.
“Someone untied him!” the executioner was snarling. “We should search the grounds, the
forest.”
“Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him
away on foot?” said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. “Search the skies, if you will…Hagrid, I
could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.”
“O’ — o’ course, Professor,” said Hagrid, who sounded weak with happiness. “Come in, come
in…”
Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner,
the snap of the door, and then silence once more.
“Now what?” whispered Harry, looking around.
“We’ll have to hide in here,” said Hermione, who looked very shaken. “We need to wait until
they’ve gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it’s safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius’s window.
He won’t be there for another couple of hours…Oh, this is going to be difficult…”
She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest. The sun was setting now.
“We’re going to have to move,” said Harry, thinking hard. “We’ve got to be able to see the
Whomping Willow, or we won’t know what’s going on.”
“Okay,” said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak’s rope. “But we’ve got to keep out of
sight, Harry, remember…”
They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly around them, until they were
hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow.
“There’s Ron!” said Harry suddenly.
A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air.
“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here —”
And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry watched himself and
Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.
“Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat —”
“There’s Sirius!” said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the
Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize on…
“Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said Harry, watching the dog pulling Ron into the
roots. “Ouch — look, I just got walloped by the tree — and so did you — this is weird —”
The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches; they could see
themselves darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And then the tree froze.
“That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,” said Hermione.
“And there we go…” Harry muttered. “We’re in.”
The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps
quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old Committee member were making their
way up to the castle.
“Right after we’d gone down into the passage!” said Hermione. “If only Dumbledore had come
with us…”
“Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said Harry bitterly. “I bet you anything Fudge
would’ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot…”
They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view. For a few minutes
the scene was deserted. Then —
“Here comes Lupin!” said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and
halting toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon
completely.
They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk.
The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the gap in its roots.
“If he’d only grabbed the cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lying there…”
He turned to Hermione.
“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d never be able to get it and —”
“Harry, we mustn’t be seen!”
“How can you stand this?” he asked Hermione fiercely. “Just standing here and watching it
happen?” He hesitated. “I’m going to grab the cloak!”
“Harry, no!”
Hermione seized the back of Harry’s robes not a moment too soon. Just then, they heard a burst
of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving
slightly as he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.
“See?” Hermione whispered. “See what would have happened? We’ve got to keep out of sight!
No, Buckbeak!”
The Hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry seized his rope too,
straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was
gone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.
Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape came charging out of
them, running toward the Willow.
Harry’s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around. He
grabbed the cloak and held it up.
“Get your filthy hands off it,” Harry snarled under his breath.
“Shh!”
Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the knot, and vanished from
view as he put on the cloak.
“So that’s it,” said Hermione quietly. “We’re all down there…and now we’ve just got to wait
until we come back up again…”
She took the end of Buckbeak’s rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree, then sat down
on the dry ground, arms around her knees.
“Harry, there’s something I don’t understand…Why didn’t the Dementors get Sirius? I
remember them coming, and then I think I passed out…there were so many of them…”
Harry sat down too. He explained what he’d seen; how, as the nearest Dementor had lowered its
mouth to Harry’s, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the
Dementors to retreat.
Hermione’s mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.
“But what was it?”
“There’s only one thing it could have been, to make the Dementors go,” said Harry. “A real
Patronus. A powerful one.”
“But who conjured it?”
Harry didn’t say anything. He was thinking back to the person he’d seen on the other bank of
the lake. He knew who he thought it had been…but how could it have been?
“Didn’t you see what they looked like?” said Hermione eagerly. “Was it one of the teachers?”
“No,” said Harry. “He wasn’t a teacher.”
“But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those Dementors away…If the
Patronus was shining so brightly, didn’t it light him up? Couldn’t you see —?”
“Yeah, I saw him,” said Harry slowly. “But…maybe I imagined it…I wasn’t thinking straight…I
passed out right afterward…”
“Who did you think it was?”
“I think —” Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to sound. “I think it was my
dad.”
Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now. She was gazing at
him with a mixture of alarm and pity.
“Harry, your dad’s — well — dead,” she said quietly.
“I know that,” said Harry quickly.
“You think you saw his ghost?”
“I don’t know…no…he looked solid…”
“But then —”
“Maybe I was seeing things,” said Harry. “But…from what I could see…it looked like him…I’ve
got photos of him…”
Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.
“I know it sounds crazy,” said Harry flatly. He turned to took at Buckbeak, who was digging his
beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he wasn’t really watching Buckbeak.
He was thinking about his father and about his father’s three oldest friends…Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot, and Prongs…Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had
reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead…Was it so impossible his father
had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The figure had been too far away to
see distinctly…yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he’d lost consciousness…
The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in and out of sight behind
the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow, waiting.
And then, at last, after over an hour…
“Here we come!” Hermione whispered.
She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew
clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots. Then came Hermione…then the unconscious
Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward the
castle.
Harry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that
cloud was going to move aside and show the moon…
“Harry,” Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking, “we’ve got to
stay put. We mustn’t be seen. There’s nothing we can do…”
“So we’re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again…” said Harry quietly.
“How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?” snapped Hermione. “There’s nothing we can do!
We came back to help Sirius; we’re not supposed to be doing anything else!”
“All right!”
The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop.
Then they saw movement —
“There goes Lupin,” Hermione whispered. “He’s transforming.”
“Hermione!” said Harry suddenly. “We’ve got to move!”
“We mustn’t, I keep telling you —”
“Not to interfere! Lupin’s going to run into the forest, right at us!”
Hermione gasped.
“Quick!” she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. “Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are
we going to hide? The Dementors will be coming any moment —”
“Back to Hagrid’s!” Harry said. “It’s empty now — come on!”
They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them. They could hear the
werewolf howling behind them…
The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and
Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door. Fang the
boarhound barked loudly.
“Shh, Fang, it’s us!” said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him. “That
was really close!” she said to Harry.
“Yeah…”
Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here.
Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid’s house. He lay down in front of
the fire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.
“I think I’d better go outside again, you know,” said Harry slowly. “I can’t see what’s going on
— we won’t know when it’s time —”
Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.
“I’m not going to try and interfere,” said Harry quickly. “But if we don’t see what’s going on,
how’re we going to know when it’s time to rescue Sirius?”
“Well…okay, then…I’ll wait here with Buckbeak…but Harry, be careful — there’s a werewolf
out there — and the Dementors.”
Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear yelping in the distance.
That meant the Dementors were closing in on Sirius…He and Hermione would be running to him
any moment…
Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest…Whoever had
sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment…
For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid’s door. You must not be seen.
But he didn’t want to be seen. He wanted to do the seeing…He had to know…
And there were the Dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness from every direction,
gliding around the edges of the lake…They were moving away from where Harry stood, to the
opposite bank…He wouldn’t have to get near them…
Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father…If it was him…if it really
was him…he had to know, had to find out…
The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody. On the opposite
bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver — his own attempts at a Patronus —
There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself behind it, peering
desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly
extinguished. A terrified excitement shot through him — any moment now —
“Come on!” he muttered, staring about. “Where are you? Dad, come on —”
But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of Dementors across the lake. One
of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to
help this time —
And then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen his father he had seen himself —
Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” he yelled.
And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling,
silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was
galloping silently away from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and
charge at the swarming Dementors…Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on
the ground, and the Dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating into the darkness…They
were gone.
The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still surface of the water. It
wasn’t a horse. It wasn’t a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon
above…it was coming back to him…
It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its
large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. And Harry realized…“Prongs,” he whispered.
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it vanished.
Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of his heart, he heard hooves
behind him. He whirled around and saw Hermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind
her.
“What did you do?” she said fiercely. “You said you were only going to keep a lookout!”
“I just saved all our lives…” said Harry. “Get behind here behind this bush — I’ll explain.”
Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again.
“Did anyone see you?”
“Yes, haven’t you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad! It’s okay!”
“Harry, I can’t believe it…You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those Dementors!
That’s very, very advanced magic.”
“I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because I’d already done it…Does that make
sense?”
“I don’t know — Harry, look at Snape!”
Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had regained consciousness. He
was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A
fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out in
front of him, he moved them away toward the castle.
“Right, it’s nearly time,” said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch. “We’ve got about forty-
five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We’ve got to rescue Sirius and
get back into the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing…”
They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to them
whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again.
“Do you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry, checking his watch. He looked up at the castle
and began counting the windows to the right of the West Tower.
“Look!” Hermione whispered. “Who’s that? Someone’s coming back out of the castle!”
Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the
entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt.
“Macnair!” said Harry. “The executioner! He’s gone to get the Dementors! This is it, Hermione
—”
Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak’s back and Harry gave her a leg up. Then he placed his
foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s
rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins.
“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better hold on to me —”
He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.
Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks with his knees, feeling the
great wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the
waist; he could hear her muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this oh, I really don’t like this —”
Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the
castle…Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying
to count the windows flashing past —
“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.
Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you counted the fact that
they kept rising up and down several feet as the Hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne.
“He’s there!” Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the window. He reached out, and
as Buckbeak’s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass.
Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair, hurried to the window and
tried to open it, but it was locked.
“Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still gripping the back of
Harry’s robes with her left hand.
“Alohomora!”
The window sprang open.
“How — how —?” said Black weakly, staring at the Hippogriff.
“Get on — there’s not much time,” said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of his
sleek neck to hold him steady. “You’ve got to get out of here — the Dementors are coming —
Macnair’s gone to get them.”
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out
of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak’s
back and pull himself onto the Hippogriff behind Hermione.
“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope. “Up to the tower — come on.”
The Hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again, high as
the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements, and Harry and
Hermione slid off him at once.
“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll reach Flitwick’s office any moment,
they’ll find out you’re gone.”
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
“What happened to the other boy? Ron?” croaked Sirius.
“He’s going to be okay. He’s still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says she’ll be able to make him
better. Quick — go —”
But Black was still staring down at Harry.
“How can I ever thank —”
“GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together.
Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.
“We’ll see each other again,” he said. “You are — truly your father’s son, Harry…”
He squeezed Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous
wings rose once more…The Hippogriff took off into the air…He and his rider became smaller and
smaller as Harry gazed after them…then a cloud drifted across the moon…They were gone.
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
OWL POST AGAIN
“Harry!”
Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch. “We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get
back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us — before Dumbledore locks the door—”
“Okay,” said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, “let’s go…”
They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase. As
they reached the bottom of it, they heard voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and
listened. It sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot
of the staircase.
“…only hope Dumbledore’s not going to make difficulties,” Snape was saying. “The Kiss will be
performed immediately?”
“As soon as Macnair returns with the Dementors. This whole Black affair has been highly
embarrassing. I can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that
we’ve got him at last…I daresay they’ll want to interview you, Snape…and once young Harry’s back
in his right mind, I expect he’ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him…”
Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape’s smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry
and Hermione’s hiding place. Their footsteps died away. Harry and Hermione waited a few
moments to make sure they’d really gone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one
staircase, then another, along a new corridor — then they heard a cackling ahead.
“Peeves!” Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione’s wrist. “In here!”
They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves seemed to be bouncing along
the corridor in boisterous good spirits, laughing his head off.
“Oh, he’s horrible,” whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. “I bet he’s all excited because the
Dementors are going to finish off Sirius…” She checked her watch. “Three minutes, Harry!”
They waited until Peeves’s gloating voice had faded into the distance, then slid back out of the
room and broke into a run again.
“Hermione — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back inside before Dumbledore locks the
door?” Harry panted.
“I don’t want to think about it!” Hermione moaned, checking her watch again. “One minute!”
They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance. “Okay — I can hear
Dumbledore,” said Hermione tensely. “Come on, Harry!”
They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore’s back appeared.
“I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying. “it is five minutes to midnight. Miss
Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.”
Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his wand to magically lock
it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward. Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared
under the long silver mustache. “Well?” he said quietly.
“We did it!” said Harry breathlessly. “Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak…”
Dumbledore beamed at them.
“Well done. I think —” He listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing. “Yes, I
think you’ve gone too — get inside — I’ll lock you in —”
Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty except for Ron, who was
still lying motionless in the end bed. As the lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept
back to their own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment later,
Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office.
“Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my patients now?”
She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate
quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow.
He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling…And then, as they both took a
fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from
somewhere above them…
“What was that?” said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.
Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at
the door.
“Really — they’ll wake everybody up! What do they think they’re doing?”
Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing nearer —
“He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the room with him.
When this gets out —”
“HE DIDN’T DISAPPARATE!” Snape roared, now very close at hand. “YOU CAN’T
APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS — HAS — SOMETHING —
TO — DO — WITH — POTTER!”
“Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked up —”
BAM.
The door of the hospital wing burst open.
Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore alone looked calm.
Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was
beside himself.
“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID YOU DO?”
“Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey. “Control yourself!”
“See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This door’s been locked, we just saw —”
“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape howled, pointing at Harry and
Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking nonsense!”
“YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT —”
“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Think about what you are saying. This door
has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their
beds?”
“Of course not!” said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. “I would have heard them!”
“Well, there you have it, Severus,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Unless you are suggesting that
Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in
troubling them further.”
Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior,
to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing
behind him, and stormed out of the ward.
“Fellow seems quite unbalanced,” said Fudge, staring after him. “I’d watch out for him if I were
you, Dumbledore.”
“Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said Dumbledore quietly. “He’s just suffered a severe
disappointment.”
“He’s not the only one!” puffed Fudge. “The Daily Prophet’s going to have a field day! We had
Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that
Hippogriff’s escape to get out, and I’ll be a laughingstock! Well…I’d better go and notify the
Ministry…”
“And the Dementors?” said Dumbledore. “They’ll be removed from the school, I trust?”
“Oh yes, they’ll have to go,” said Fudge, running his fingers distractedly through his hair. “Never
dreamed they’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy…Completely out of
control…no, I’ll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight…Perhaps we should think about
dragons at the school entrance…”
“Hagrid would like that,” said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and Hermione. As he and Fudge
left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to
herself, she headed back to her office.
There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up. They could see him
sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around.
“What — what happened?” he groaned. “Harry? Why are we in here? Where’s Sirius? Where’s
Lupin? What’s going on?”
Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
“You explain,” said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an
almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking
full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so
they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the
previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching
the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread of the conversation
as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him from there just last
night…
A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very bleary-eyed Hagrid, mopping his
sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.
“Know I shouldn’ feel happy, after wha’ happened las’ night,” he said. “I mean, Black escapin’
again, an, everythin’ — but guess what?”
“What?” they said, pretending to look curious.
“Beaky! He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all night!”
“That’s wonderful!” said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because he looked as though he
was close to laughing.
“Yeah…can’t’ve tied him up properly,” said Hagrid, gazing happily out over the grounds. “I was
worried this mornin’, mind…thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin
says he never ate anythin’ las’ night…”
“What?” said Harry quickly.
“Blimey, haven’ yeh heard?” said Hagrid, his smile fading a little. He lowered his voice, even
though there was nobody in sight. “Er — Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin’…Thought
everyone’d know by now…Professor Lupin’s a werewolf, see. An’ he was loose on the grounds las’
night…He’s packin’ now, o’ course.”
“He’s packing?” said Harry, alarmed. “Why?”
“Leavin’, isn’ he?” said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to ask. “Resigned firs’ thing this
mornin’. Says he can’t risk it happenin again.”
Harry scrambled to his feet.
“I’m going to see him,” he said to Ron and Hermione.
“But if he’s resigned —”
“— doesn’t sound like there’s anything we can do —”
“I don’t care. I still want to see him. I’ll meet you back here.”
Lupin’s office door was open. He had already packed most of his things. The Grindylow’s empty
tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over
something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.
“I saw you coming,” said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he had been poring over.
It was the Marauder’s Map.
“I just saw Hagrid,” said Harry. “And he said you’d resigned. It’s not true, is it?”
“I’m afraid it is,” said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents.
“Why?” said Harry. “The Ministry of Magic don’t think you were helping Sirius, do they?”
Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.
“No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives.” He
sighed. “That was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard.
So he — er — accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast.”
“You’re not leaving just because of that!” said Harry.
Lupin smiled wryly.
“This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents…They will not want a werewolf
teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of
you…That must never happen again.”
“You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever had!” said Harry. “Don’t go!”
Lupin shook his head and didn’t speak. He carried on emptying his drawers. Then, while Harry
was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin said, “From what the headmaster
told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If I’m proud of anything I’ve done
this year, it’s how much you’ve learned…Tell me about your Patronus.”
“How d’you know about that?” said Harry, distracted.
“What else could have driven the Dementors back?”
Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he’d finished, Lupin was smiling again.
“Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,” he said. “You guessed right…that’s
why we called him Prongs.”
Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers, and turned to look at
Harry.
“Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,” he said, handing Harry back the
Invisibility Cloak. “And…” He hesitated, then held out the Marauder’s Map too. “I am no longer
your teacher, so I don’t feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It’s no use to me, and I daresay
you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.”
Harry took the map and grinned.
“You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would’ve wanted to lure me out of
school…you said they’d have thought it was funny.”
“And so we would have,” said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case. “I have no hesitation
in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the
secret passages out of the castle.”
There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder’s Map and the Invisibility
Cloak into his pocket.
It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn’t look surprised to see Harry there.
“Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said.
“Thank You, Headmaster.”
Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty Grindylow tank.
“Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure
we’ll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage…”
Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible.
“Good-bye, then, Remus,” said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the Grindylow tank slightly
so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands. Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile,
Lupin left the office.
Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He heard the door close and
looked up. Dumbledore was still there.
“Why so miserable, Harry?” he said quietly. “You should be very proud of yourself after last
night.”
“It didn’t make any difference,” said Harry bitterly. “Pettigrew got away.”
“Didn’t make any difference?” said Dumbledore quietly, “it made all the difference in the world,
Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.”
Terrible. Something stirred in Harry’s memory. Greater and more terrible than ever
before…Professor Trelawney’s prediction!
“Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor
Trelawney went very — very strange.”
“Indeed?” said Dumbledore. “Er — stranger than usual, you mean?”
“Yes…her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said…she said Voldemort’s servant was
going to set out to return to him before midnight…She said the servant would help him come back
to power.” Harry stared up at Dumbledore. “And then she sort of became normal again, and she
couldn’t remember anything she’d said. Was it — was she making a real prediction?”
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.
“Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been.” he said thoughtfully. “Who’d have thought
it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise…”
“But —” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so calmly?
“But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if
Voldemort comes back!”
“It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your experience with the Time-Turner taught
you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that
predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed…Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living
proof of that…You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.”
“But if he helps Voldemort back to power…”
“Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt…When
one wizard saves another wizard’s life, it creates a certain bond between them…and I’m much
mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter.”
“I don’t want a connection with Pettigrew!” said Harry. “He betrayed my parents!”
“This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me…the time may come
when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.”
Harry couldn’t imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though he knew what
Harry was thinking.
“I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,” he said gently. “He would
have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.”
Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn’t laugh — he could tell Dumbledore…
“I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the
lake…I thought I was seeing him.”
“An easy mistake to make,” said Dumbledore softly. “I expect you’ll tire of hearing it, but you do
look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes…you have your mother’s eyes.”
Harry shook his head.
“It was stupid, thinking it was him,” he muttered. “I mean, I knew he was dead.”
“You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don’t recall them more
clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most
plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs
rode again last night.”
It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said.
“Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “An
extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most
unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match
against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night…You found him
inside yourself.”
And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts.
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak,
and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end
of term approached, Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none
of them came close to the truth.
Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of
smuggling the Hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted
by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius’s escape.
“If I manage to get into the Ministry, I’ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law
Enforcement!” he told the only person who would listen — his girlfriend, Penelope.
Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they
had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end
of a school year in worse spirits.
He certainly wasn’t the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry’s
Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation.
“Wonder what they’ll give us next year?” said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.
“Maybe a vampire,” suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.
It wasn’t only Professor Lupin’s departure that was weighing on Harry’s mind. He couldn’t help
thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney’s prediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now,
whether he had sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering Harry’s spirits
most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half
hour, he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on…his parents’ best friend…It
would have been the next best thing to having his own father back. And while no news of Sirius was
definitely good news, because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn’t help
feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had, and the fact that it was now
impossible.
The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had passed every
subject. Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that
Dumbledore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape’s behavior toward
Harry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn’t have thought it possible that
Snape’s dislike for him could increase, but it certainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the
corner of Snape’s thin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing his
fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry’s throat.
Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had scraped a handful of O.W.L.s
each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the
Quidditch Cup, had won the House championship for the third year running. This meant that the
end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the Gryffindor table was
the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forget about the journey
back to the Dursleys the next day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next morning, Hermione gave Harry and
Ron some surprising news.
“I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast. I’ve decided to drop
Muggle Studies.”
“But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!” said Ron.
“I know,” sighed Hermione, “but I can’t stand another year like this one. That Time-Turner, it
was driving me mad. I’ve handed it in. Without Muggle Studies and Divination, I’ll be able to have
a normal schedule again.”
“I still can’t believe you didn’t tell us about it,” said Ron grumpily. “We’re supposed to be your
friends.”
“I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone,” said Hermione severely. She looked around at Harry, who
was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain. Two whole months before he’d see
it again…
“Oh, cheer up, Harry!” said Hermione sadly.
“I’m okay,” said Harry quickly. “Just thinking about the holidays.”
“Yeah, I’ve been thinking about them too,” said Ron. “Harry, you’ve got to come and stay with
us. I’ll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I’ll call you. I know how to use a fellytone now —”
“A telephone, Ron,” said Hermione. “Honestly, you should take Muggle Studies next year…”
Ron ignored her.
“It’s the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come and stay, and we’ll go
and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work.”
This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.
“Yeah…I bet the Dursleys’d be pleased to let me come…especially after what I did to Aunt
Marge…”
Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in several games of
Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cart arrived, he bought himself a very large lunch,
though nothing with chocolate in it.
But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up…
“Harry,” said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. “What’s that thing outside your
window?”
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight
beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that
was much too big for it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted
this way and that in the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window, stretched out his
arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside.
The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and began zooming around their compartment,
apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of
dignified disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow eyes.
Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the letter, and shouted, “It’s
from Sirius!”
“What?” said Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it aloud!”
Dear Harry,
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don’t know whether they’re used to owl
post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I
have some doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the Dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a hope of finding me here. I am
planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the
castle will be lifted.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you
the Firebolt —
“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I told you it was from him!”
“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron. “Ouch!” The tiny owl now hooting happily in
his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.
– Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name but told them to take the
gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays’ worth of presents from your
godfather.
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your
uncle’s house. I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the
sight of me alarmed you.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more
enjoyable.
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.
I’ll write again soon.
Sirius
Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of parchment in there. He
read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle
of hot butterbeer in one gulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily. He looked back at Sirius’s letter.
“Hang on, there’s a PS…”
I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault he no longer has a rat.
Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. “Keep him?” he said
uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great
surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff.
“What do you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”
Crookshanks purred.
“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s mine.”
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King’s Cross station. It was still
clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform
nine and three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good distance from
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting,
his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed.
“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him and Hermione good-
bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who
greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand. “If it’s
another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” sputtered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend. He’s a convicted
murderer, but he’s broken out of wizard prison and he’s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with
me, though…keep up with my news…check if I’m happy…”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry set off toward the
station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than
the last.

HARRY POTTER
AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
BY
J.K. ROWLING
CHAPTER ONE
THE OTHER MINISTER
It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long
memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He
was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the
wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a
very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The
more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime
Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had
appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened
in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of
them was the government’s fault.
The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were
neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge
collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges.
The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had
snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how
dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-
publicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in
the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it his
fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that
he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?
“A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own
broad grin.
And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did
seem more miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of
July…It wasn’t right, it wasn’t normal…
He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up
as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a
handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the
unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window,
looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his
back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.
He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that
cough. He had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room.
“Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.
For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him.
However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a
prepared statement. It was coming — as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough — from
the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the
far corner of the room.
“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely,
Fudge.”
The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.
“Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen…It’s not a very good time for me…I’m waiting for a
telephone call, you see…from the President of —”
“That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister’s heart sank. He had
been afraid of that.
“But I really was rather hoping to speak —”
“We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,”
said the little man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.”
“I…oh…very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Yes, I’ll see Fudge.”
He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and
arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames
burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a
flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top.
Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his
long pin-striped cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand.
“Ah…Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched.
“Good to see you again.”
The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was
not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright
alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore,
Fudge was looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a
crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never
boded well.
“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand very briefly and gesturing toward the
hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.
“Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and
placing his green bowler upon his knees. “What a week, what a week…”
“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that
he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.
“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime
Minister. “I’ve been having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge…the
Bones and Vance murders…not to mention the ruckus in the West Country…”
“You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your people were — were involved in those —
those things, were they?”
Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. “Of course they were,” he said,
“Surely you’ve realized what’s going on?”
“I…” hesitated the Prime Minister.
It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge’s visits so much. He was, after
all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of
course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime
Minister. He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his
dying day.
He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many
years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and
turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was
about to arrive and introduce himself
Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him
to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been
nothing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken
his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation that there were
witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to
bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding
community and prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them. It was, said
Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of
broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered
clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the still-
dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.
“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never see me again. I’ll only bother you if
there’s something really serious going on our end, something that’s likely to affect the Muggles —
the non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let live. And I must say, you’re
taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a
hoax planned by the opposition.”
At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. “You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?”
It had been his last, desperate hope.
“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.”
And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a gerbil.
“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his
next speech, “but why — why has nobody told me —?”
“The Minister of Magic only reveals him — or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,”
said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. “We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.”
“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a former Prime Minister warned me -?”
At this, Fudge had actually laughed.
“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?”
Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald
flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite
motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a
living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?
The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that
Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election
campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had
given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of
the ugly little man who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the Prime Minister’s dismay, however,
the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art
historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to pry it from the wall,
the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained
motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out
of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once
or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas
behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell
himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.
Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his
office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst
out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister
could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the
Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something that sounded like
“Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime
Minister.
“…I’ve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the
rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. “Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight…the
dementors are in uproar”— he shuddered — “they’ve never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to
come to you, Prime Minister. Black’s a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-
Know-Who…But of course, you don’t even know who You-Know-Who is!” He had gazed
hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d better fill
you in…Have a whiskey…”
The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his
own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of
amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister’s hand, and drew up a
chair.
Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name
aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister’s
whiskey-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.
“So you think that…” He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. “Lord Vol —”
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” snarled Fudge.
“I’m sorry…You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still alive, then?”
“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his
chin, “but we’ve never found him. If you ask me, he’s not dangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s
Black we ought to be worrying about. You’ll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we
don’t see each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.”
But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared
out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother
at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had
been “involved,” but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-Know-Who’s Mark
had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle
Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.
“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We’re importing three foreign dragons and a
sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and
Control of Magical Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if
we’re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.”
“I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister.
“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good day to you.”
The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it,
but no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the
news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.
“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.
“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames.
“We’ll have them rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to know!”
And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait just one moment!” Fudge had vanished
in a shower of green sparks.
Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It
had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge’s assurances at their first meeting, they were now
seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little
though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the
Other Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it
would be with graver news still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more,
looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly
why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely
gloomy week.
“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — Wizarding community?” snapped the
Prime Minister now. “I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without—”
“We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted. “The Brockdale Bridge didn’t wear out. That
wasn’t really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’s
family would be safer without him. We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred
to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be affected tonight.”
“What do you…I’m afraid I…What?” blustered the Prime Minister.
Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you
that he’s back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.”
“Back? When you say ‘back’…he’s alive? I mean —”
The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three
years previously, when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the
wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen
years earlier.
“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’t know — is a man alive if he can’t be killed? I don’t
really understand it, and Dumbledore won’t explain properly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a
body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes,
he’s alive.”
The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear
well-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember
of their previous conversations.
“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”
“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. “Sirius Black,
you mean? Merlin’s beard, no. Black’s dead. Turns out we were — er — mistaken about Black. He
was innocent after all. And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean,”
he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, “all the evidence pointed — we had more
than fifty eyewitnesses — but anyway, as I say, he’s dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry
of Magic premises. There’s going to be an inquiry, actually…”
To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It
was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient
though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a
murder in any of the government departments under his charge…Not yet, anyway…
While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, “But
Blacks by-the-by now. The point is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.”
“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously. “Surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?”
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of
Azkaban in January,” said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast
that it was a lime-green blur. “Since they have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc.
The Brockdale Bridge — he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I
stood aside for him and —”
“Good grief, so it’s your fault those people were killed and I’m having to answer questions about
rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don’t know what else!” said the Prime Minister
furiously.
“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like
that?”
“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about the room, “but I would
have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!”
“Do you really think I wasn’t already making every effort?” demanded Fudge heatedly. “Every
Auror in the Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and round up his followers, but we
happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded
capture for almost three decades!”
“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?” said the
Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason
for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the
government’s fault after all.
“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably.
“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. “Trees
uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries —”
“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s followers. And…and
we suspect giant involvement.”
The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. “What
involvement?”
Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect,” he said.
“The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, we’ve had teams of Obliviators
out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we’ve got most
of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset,
but we can’t find the giant — it’s been a disaster.”
“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously.
“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,” said Fudge. “What with all that, and
then losing Amelia Bones.”
“Losing who?”
“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named may have murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch and —
and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight.”
Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat.
“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from
his anger. “Our newspapers. Amelia Bones…it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived
alone. It was a — a nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled,
you see.”
Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. “Killed in a room that was locked from the
inside, wasn’t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further
toward catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didn’t hear about that one
—”
“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened just around the corner from here, as a
matter of fact. The papers had a field day with it, ‘breakdown of law and order in the Prime
Minister’s backyard — ’”
“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely listening to the Prime Minister, “we’ve got
dementors swarming all over the place, attacking people left, right, and center…”
Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister,
but he was wiser now.
“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban,” he said cautiously.
“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. They’ve deserted the prison and joined He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.”
“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the
creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?”
“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s causing all this mist.”
The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures
swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made
him feel quite faint.
“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! It’s your responsibility as Minister of
Magic!”
“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m still Minister of Magic after all this? I was
sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a
fortnight. I’ve never known them so united in my whole term of office!” said Fudge, with a brave
attempt at a smile.
The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his indignation at the position into
which he had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.
“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I can do?”
“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you
up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought he’d be here by
now, but of course, he’s very busy at the moment, with so much going on.”
Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who
was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be
here in a moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.”
“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time. “I’ve been writing to
Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won’t budge. If he’d just been prepared to
persuade the boy, I might still be…Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.”
Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately
by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.
“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond
immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.”
“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the
grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart,
disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.
Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same,
watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.
The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old
lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen
yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though
he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the
Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to
Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times.
“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.
Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his
robes.
“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with
his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d rather that door remained
unlocked.”
“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he added, pointing his
wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s
get down to business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.”
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, “I am perfectly happy with
the security I’ve already got, thank you very —”
“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime
Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in your outer office —”
“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re suggesting!” said the Prime
Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them —”
“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile. “A highly trained
Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection.”
“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just put your people into my
office, I decide who works for me —”
“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said Scrimgeour coldly.
“I am — that’s to say, I was —”
“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour.
“I…well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to be…er…excellent,” said the Prime Minister
lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.
“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” he continued. “The one who has been
entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.”
“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister.
“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,” said Scrimgeour. “It’s addled his
brains, but he could still be dangerous.”
“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Surely a bit of a rest…Maybe go easy on
the drink…”
“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining
him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it best
that we remove him from Muggle society for a while.”
“I…well…He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the Prime Minister anxiously.
Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the fireplace.
“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Minister —
or, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here.
He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.”
Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked as though he had a toothache.
Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire
green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he had
fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.
“But for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out — well —
anything!”
Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really
did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, “The trouble is, the other side can do magic too,
Prime Minister.”
And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and
vanished.
CHAPTER TWO
SPINNER’S END
Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Minister’s windows drifted
over a dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish-strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic
of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of
the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose
hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass.
But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the
river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take
its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the
grass.
With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.
“Wait!”
The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its
hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the
ground, dead.
The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
“Just a fox,” said a woman’s voice dismissively from under the hood. “I thought perhaps an
Auror — Cissy, wait!”
But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was already scrambling up
the bank the fox had just fallen down.
“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me —”
The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other wrenched it away.
“Go back, Bella!”
“You must listen to me!”
“I’ve listened already. I’ve made my decision. Leave me alone!”
The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the
river from a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they
stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull
and blind in the darkness.
“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt. “Here? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be
the first of our kind ever to set foot —”
But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was
already hurrying across the road.
“Cissy, wait!”
Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between
the houses into a second, almost identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two
women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her
prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and
swinging her around so that they faced each other.
“Cissy, you must not do this, you can’t trust him —”
“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’t he?”
“The Dark Lord is…I believe…mistaken,” Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily
under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. “In any case, we were
told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord’s —”
“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it
threateningly in the other’s face. Bella merely laughed.
“Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn’t —”
“There is nothing I wouldn’t do anymore!” Narcissa breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice,
and as she brought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her
sister’s arm as though burned.
“Narcissa!”
But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her
distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa
hurried up a street named Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover
like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and
broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light glimmered through the
curtains in a downstairs room.
She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together
they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them
on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a
crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in
curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.
Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long
blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.
“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her
sister too. “What a pleasant surprise!
“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper. “May I speak to you? It’s urgent.”
“But of course.”
He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her still-hooded sister followed without
invitation.
“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him.
“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door
with a snap behind them.
They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell.
The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a
threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light
cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it was
not usually inhabited.
Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring
at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as
her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as
she moved to stand behind Narcissa.
“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling himself in the armchair opposite the two
sisters.
“We…we are alone, aren’t we?” Narcissa asked quietly.
“Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail’s here, but we’re not counting vermin, are we?”
He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, a hidden door flew open,
revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen.
“As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,” said Snape lazily.
The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into the room. He had small,
watery eyes, a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his right,
which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove.
“Narcissa!” he said, in a squeaky voice. “And Bellatrix! How charming —”
“Wormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said Snape. “And then he will return to his
bedroom.”
Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.
“I am not your servant!” he squeaked, avoiding Snape’s eye.
“Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me.”
“To assist, yes — but not to make you drinks and — and clean your house!”
“I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments,” said Snape
silkily. “This can be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord —”
“I can speak to him myself if I want to!”
“Of course you can,” said Snape, sneering. “But in the meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the
elf-made wine will do.”
Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue, but then turned and
headed through a second hidden door. They heard banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds
he was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He dropped these on the rickety
table and scurried from their presence, slamming the book-covered door behind him.
Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa
murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This
did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.
“The Dark Lord,” he said, raising his glass and draining it.
The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa took her second drink she said in
a rush, “Severus, I’m sorry to come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only one
who can help me —”
Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door.
There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.
“My apologies,” said Snape. “He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don’t know what he
means by it…You were saying, Narcissa?”
She took a great, shuddering breath and started again.
“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, but —”
“Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled Bellatrix. “Particularly in present company!”
‘“Present company’?” repeated Snape sardonically. “And what am I to understand by that,
Bellatrix?”
“That I don’t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!”
Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands.
Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair,
smiling into Bellatrix’s glowering face.
“Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say; it will save tedious
interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,” said Snape. “Why is it that you do not trust me?”
“A hundred reasons!” she said loudly, striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon
the table. “Where to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any
attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that you’ve lived in
Dumbledore’s pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer’s Stone? Why did
you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago when we
battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when
you have had him at your mercy for five years?”
She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks. Behind her,
Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.
Snape smiled.
“Before I answer you — oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! You can carry my words back to
the others who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord!
Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark Lord has
not asked me each and every one of those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been
able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?”
She hesitated.
“I know he believes you, but…”
“You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord,
the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?”
Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Snape did not press the
point. He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, “You ask where I was when the Dark
Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the
Dark Lord’s orders that I took up the post?”
She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape forestalled her.
“You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. For the same reason that Avery,
Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lucius”— he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa — “and many
others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but
there it is…If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers
left.”
“He’d have me!” said Bellatrix passionately. “I, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!”
“Yes, indeed, most admirable,” said Snape in a bored voice. “Of I nurse, you weren’t a lot of use
to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine —”
“Gesture!” she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. “While I endured the dementors,
you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing Dumbledore’s pet!”
“Not quite,” said Snape calmly. “He wouldn’t give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,
you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse…tempt me into my old ways.”
“This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favorite subject?” she jeered. “Why
did you stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?”
“Hardly,” said Snape, “although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had
sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful
welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is…”
“But you stayed —”
“Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed,” said Snape, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. “I had a
comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you
know. Dumbledore’s protection kept me out of jail; it was most convenient and I used it. I repeat:
The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.
“I think you next wanted to know,” he pressed on, a little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed
every sign of interrupting, “why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer’s Stone. That is
easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had
turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore’s stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak,
sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally
might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He
would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell
attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.”
Bellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.
“But you didn’t return when he came back, you didn’t fly back to him at once when you felt the
Dark Mark burn —”
“Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumbledore’s orders.”
“On Dumbledore’s —?” she began, in tones of outrage.
“Think!” said Snape, impatient again. “Think! By waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured
that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only
returning to the Dark Lord’s side because I was ordered to, I have been able to pass information on
Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: The Dark Mark had been
growing stronger for months. I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew! I had
plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to escape like Karkaroff,
didn’t I?
“The Dark Lord’s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely, I assure you, when I
explained that I remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord
thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong.”
“But what use have you been?” sneered Bellatrix. “What useful information have we had from
you?”
“My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord,” said Snape. “If he chooses not
to share it with you —”
“He shares everything with me!” said Bellatrix, firing up at once. “He calls me his most loyal, his
most faithful —”
“Does he?” said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief. “Does he still, after
the fiasco at the Ministry?”
“That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing. “The Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me
with his most precious — if Lucius hadn’t —”
“Don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my husband!” said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice,
looking up at her sister.
“There is no point apportioning blame,” said Snape smoothly. “What is done, is done.”
“But not by you!” said Bellatrix furiously. “No, you were once again absent while the rest of us
ran dangers, were you not, Snape?”
“My orders were to remain behind,” said Snape. “Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord,
perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death
Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And — forgive me — you speak of dangers…you were
facing six teenagers, were you not?”
“They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!” snarled Bellatrix.
“And, while we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of
their headquarters, don’t you?”
“I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name of the place. You understand how the
enchantment works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on
the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline
Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him
off.”
He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did not soften.
“You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point
in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?”
“Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?” asked Snape.
“He…lately, we…I am asking you, Snape!”
“If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate,
making him invincible —”
“You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she jeered.
“I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark
Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least
until a year ago…”
“But why did you keep him alive?”
“Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore’s protection that was keeping me out of
Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me?
But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts
there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard,
which was how he had survived the Dark Lord’s attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lords old
followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was
curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle.
“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He
has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more
talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his
father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he
scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to
risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.”
“And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?” asked
Bellatrix. “He has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?”
“I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you overlook Dumbledore’s greatest weakness:
He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff,
fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms — though, as I say, never
allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard — oh
yes, he has,” (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), “the Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased
to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook
him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were.
But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great
value to the Dark Lord.”
Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next.
Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.
“Now…you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?”
Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.
“Yes, Severus. I — I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn.
Lucius is in jail and…”
She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.
“The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. “He
wishes none to know of the plan. It is…very secret. But —”
“If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,” said Snape at once. “The Dark Lord’s word is
law.”
Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the
first time since she had entered the house.
“There!” she said triumphantly to her sister. “Even Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so
hold your silence!”
But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at
the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.
“It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a low voice. “I am one of the few the Dark
Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of
great treachery to the Dark Lord.”
“I thought you must know about it!” said Narcissa, breathing more freely. “He trusts you so,
Severus…”
“You know about the plan?” said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a
look of outrage. “You know?”
“Certainly,” said Snape. “But what help do you require, Narcissa? If you are imagining I can
persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.”
“Severus,” she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. “My son…my only son…”
“Draco should be proud,” said Bellatrix indifferently. “The Dark Lord is granting him a great
honor. And I will say this for Draco: I can see he isn’t shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad
of a chance to prove himself, excited at the prospect —”
Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape.
“That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is
too dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius’s mistake, I know it!”
Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent,
but he could not pretend not to hear her.
“That’s why he’s chosen Draco, isn’t it?” she persisted. “To punish Lucius?”
“If Draco succeeds,” said Snape, still looking away from her, “he will be honored above all
others.”
“But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa. “How can he, when the Dark Lord himself —?”
Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.
“I only meant…that nobody has yet succeeded…Severus…please…You are, you have always
been, Draco’s favorite teacher…You are Lucius’s old friend…I beg you…You are the Dark Lord’s
favorite, his most trusted advisor…Will you speak to him, persuade him —?”
“The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it,” said Snape
flatly. “I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in
charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy
into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.”
“Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!” choked Narcissa. “He does not mean him to
succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!”
When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed.
Standing up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears
falling onto his chest, she gasped, “You could do it. You could do it instead of Draco, Severus. You
would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us -”
Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her
tearstained face, he said slowly, “He intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined
that Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to
remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.”
“In other words, it doesn’t matter to him if Draco is killed!”
“The Dark Lord is very angry,” repeated Snape quietly. “He failed to hear the prophecy. You
know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.”
She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the floor.
“My only son…my only son…”
“You should be proud!” said Bellatrix ruthlessly. “If I had sons, I would be glad to give them up
to the service of the Dark Lord!”
Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped,
seized her by the arms, lifted her up, and steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more
wine and forced the glass into her hand.
“Narcissa, that’s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.”
She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.
“It might be possible…for me to help Draco.”
She sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge.
“Severus — oh, Severus — you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no
harm?”
“I can try.”
She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling
position at Snape’s feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and pressed her lips to it.
“If you are there to protect him…Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable
Vow?”
“The Unbreakable Vow?”
Snape’s expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant
laughter.
“Aren’t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he’ll try, I’m sure…The usual empty words, the usual
slithering out of action…oh, on the Dark Lord’s orders, of course!”
Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as
she continued to clutch his hand.
“Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,” he said quietly. “Perhaps your sister
will consent to be our Bonder.”
Bellatrix’s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa.
Beneath Bellatrix’s astonished gaze, they grasped right hands.
“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape coldly.
She drew it, still looking astonished.
“And you will need to move a little closer,” he said.
She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked
hands.
Narcissa spoke.
“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes?”
“I will,” said Snape.
A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like
a red-hot wire.
“And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?”
“I will,” said Snape.
A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine,
glowing chain.
“And, should it prove necessary…if it seems Draco will fail…” whispered Narcissa (Snape’s hand
twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), “will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?”
There was a moment’s silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes
wide.
“I will,” said Snape.
Bellatrix’s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame, which shot from the
wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a fiery snake.
CHAPTER THREE
WILL AND WON’T
Harry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for
the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one
side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses askew and his mouth wide open.
The misty fog his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp
outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his
shock of untidy black hair.
The room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers,
apple cores, and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy
among the tangled robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk.
The headline of one blared:
HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?
Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during
which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted once more.
“We’re not allowed to talk about it, don’t ask me anything” said one agitated Obliviator, who refused
to give his name as he left the Ministry last night.
Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered
on the fabled Hall of Prophecy.
Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place, a
growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in
Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that prophecy
is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have
survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question.
Some are going so far as to call Potter “the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names him as the
only one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-No t-Be-Named.
The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown, although {ctd. page2, column 5)
A second newspaper lay beside die first. This one bore die headline:
SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE
Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike
mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The picture was moving — the man was waving at the
ceiling.
Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been
greeted with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift between the new Minister
and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of
Scrimgeour taking office.
Scrimgeours representatives admitted that he had met with Dumbledore at once upon taking possession
of the top job, but refused to comment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd.
page 3, column 2)
To the left of this paper sat another, which had been folded so that a story bearing the title
ministry guarantees students’ safety was visible.
Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, spoke today of the tough new measures taken
by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
this autumn.
“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans,”
said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a
complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of
Hogwarts School.
Most seem reassured by the new Minister’s tough stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta
Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good friend of Harry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the
Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and —
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage, standing on top of it. Inside it was a
magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling
occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry
was too deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it looked expectant; yet it
was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear, sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills
that coated the very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:
— — ISSUED ON BEHALF OF — —
The Ministry of Magic
PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES
The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death
Eaters. Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and your
home from attack.
1. You are advised not to leave the house alone.
2. Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness. Wherever possible,
arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen.
3. Review the security arrangements around your house, making sure that all family
members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment Charms,
and, in the case of underage family members, Side-Along-Apparition.
4. Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading
as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2).
5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange manner,
contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been put under the Imperius
Curse (see page 4).
6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but
contact the Auror office immediately.
7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any
sighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY.
Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses
still more lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago,
ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by Harry’s relaxed
hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often
since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay
quite flat.
Dear Harry,
If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m.
to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays.
If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on
the way to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you.
Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this Friday,
I am yours most sincerely,
Albus Dumbledore
Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few
minutes since seven o’clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom
window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep
rereading Dumbledore’s words; Harry had sent back his “yes” with the delivering owl, as requested,
and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.
But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued
from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that
something was going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore’s letter might have gone astray;
Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from
Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then
being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a
journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.
The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at that precise moment,
the street-lamp outside the window went out.
Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and
unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted
down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.
Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and
started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the
trunk. Then as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of clasps across the room, the
doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, “Who the blazes is calling
at this time of night?”
Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had
completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky
mid close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to
hear a deep voice say, “Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I
would be coming for him?”
Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom,
as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible.
There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon
spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and a
pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore’s, though black,
and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe
his tiny eyes.
“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,” said
Dumbledore pleasantly. “However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house.
It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.”
He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him.
“It is a long time since my last visit,” said Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle
Vernon. “I must say, your agapanthus are flourishing.”
Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and
soon — the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point — but something about
Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant
wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense
that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.
“Ah, good evening Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses
with a most satisfied expression. “Excellent, excellent.”
These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any
man who could look at Harry and say “excellent” was a man with whom he could never see eye to
eye.
“I don’t mean to be rude —” he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable.
“— yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,” Dumbledore finished the sentence
gravely. “Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.”
The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a
housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the
kitchen surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.
“Albus Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction.
“We have corresponded, of course.” Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that
he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. “And this
must be your son, Dudley?”
Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door, his large, blond head rising out of
the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and
fear. Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were
going to say anything, but as the silence stretched on he smiled.
“Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room?”
Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope
and trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the
armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest.
He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.
“Aren’t — aren’t we leaving, sir?” Harry asked anxiously.
“Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,” said Dumbledore. “And
I would prefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality
only a little longer.”
“You will, will you?”
Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder, and Dudley skulking behind
them both.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore simply, “I shall.”
He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed
forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon
it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.
“We may as well be comfortable,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it
looked as though his flesh had been burned away.
“Sir — what happened to your —?”
“Later, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Please sit down.”
Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned
into silence.
“I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,” Dumbledore said to Uncle
Vernon, “but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.”
A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle
tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then
floated to each person in the room.
“Madam Rosmertas finest oak-matured mead,” said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who
caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it
immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses
completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry
could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.
“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, turning toward him, “a difficulty has arisen which I hope you
will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you
that Sirius’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.”
Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernons head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he
think of anything to say except, “Oh. Right.”
“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went on. “You add a reasonable
amount of gold to your account at gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The
slightly problematic part of the legacy —”
“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both
turned to look at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernons
head; he attempted to beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. “Our
problem,” he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, “is that Sirius also left you
number twelve, Grimmauld Place.”
“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody
answered him.
“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. “I don’t care. You can have it, I don’t really
want it.” Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help
it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms
alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.
“That is generous,” said Dumbledore. “We have, however, vacated the building temporarily.”
“Why?”
“Well,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped
smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead, “Black family tradition decreed that the house
was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of ‘Black.’ Sirius was the very last
of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will
makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some
spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other
than a pureblood.”
A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius’s mother that hung in the hall of
number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry’s mind. “I bet there has,” he said.
“Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house
is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix
Lestrange.”
Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his
lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius’s killer, inherit his house?
“No,” he said.
“Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it either,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The
situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves
have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed
from Sirius’s hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally
we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position.”
“But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to own it?”
“Fortunately,” said Dumbledore, “there is a simple test.”
He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but before he could do anything else,
Uncle Vernon shouted, “Will you get these ruddy things off us?”
Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as
their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his wand again. All three glasses
vanished. “But it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.”
It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he
merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his
small piggy eyes on Dumbledore’s wand.
“You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon
had not uttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited —”
He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a
snout for a nose, giant bat’s ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys’ shag
carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek; nothing this filthy had
entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with
them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama
trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed,
“What the hell is that?”
“Kreacher,” finished Dumbledore.
“Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t!” croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as
Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears. “Kreacher belongs to Miss
Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won’t go
to the Potter brat, Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t —”
“As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher’s continued croaks of “wont,
won’t, won’t,” “Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.”
“I don’t care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. “I
don’t want him.”
“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t —”
“You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that
he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?”
“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t —”
Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with
Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had
betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.
“Give him an order,” said Dumbledore. “If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to
obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful
mistress.”
“Won’t, won’t, won’t, WON’T!”
Kreacher’s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, “Kreacher,
shut up!”
It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his
mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw
himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands
and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.
“Well, that simplifies matters,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “It means that Sirius knew what he
was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.”
“Do I — do I have to keep him with me?” Harry asked, aghast, us Kreacher thrashed around at
his feet.
“Not if you don’t want to,” said Dumbledore. “If I might make a suggestion, you could send
him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye
on him.”
“Yeah,” said Harry in relief, “yeah, I’ll do that. Er — Kreacher — I want you to go to Hogwarts
and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves.”
Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one
upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has
been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make
different arrangements —”
“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.”
“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again.
Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’
for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once
sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?”
“Erm…”
“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope
and trainers.
It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed
to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change
ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and
holding Hedwig’s cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs,
He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that
he had to return to the living room.
Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the
atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said,
“Professor — I’m ready now.”
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Just one last thing, then.” And he turned to speak to the Dursleys
once more.
“As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year’s time —”
“No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore’s arrival.
“I’m sorry?” said Dumbledore politely.
“No, he doesn’t. He’s a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders doesn’t turn eighteen until
the year after next.”
“Ah,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but in the Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.”
Uncle Vernon muttered, “Preposterous,” but Dumbledore ignored him,
“Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country. The
Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has
already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when
I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents’ murder
and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own.”
Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious
sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very
slightly closer together.
“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but
neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the
appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.”
Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see
someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.
“Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you —?” began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore
raised his finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.
“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can
still call this house ‘home.’ However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly
treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the
moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only
this: that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday,
which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.”
None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying
to work out when he had ever been mistreated.
Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however,
was oddly flushed.
“Well, Harry…time for us to be off,” said Dumbledore at last, standing up and straightening his
long black cloak. “Until we meet again,” he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment
could wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his hat, he swept from the room.
“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry’s
trunk, upon which Hedwig’s cage was perched.
“We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” he said, pulling out his wand again. “I
shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility
Cloak…just in case.”
Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore
the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his
wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then waved his wand again, and the
front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.
“And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”
CHAPTER FOUR
HORACE SLUGHORN
Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately
that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off
down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of
Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last face-to-face
encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry’s sense of embarrassment; he had
shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore’s most
prized possessions.
Dumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed.
“Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,” he said brightly.
“But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?”
“If there is an attack,” said Dumbledore, “I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse
that might occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.”
“Why not, sir?”
“You are with me,” said Dumbledore simply. “This will do, Harry.”
He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
“You have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test,” he said.
“No,” said Harry. “I thought you had to be seventeen?”
“You do,” said Dumbledore. “So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you
don’t mind — as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.”
Harry gripped Dumbledore’s proffered forearm.
“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Well, here we go.”
Harry felt Dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he
knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not
breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into
his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then —
He gulped great lungfulls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes. He felt as though he
had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that
Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a
deserted village square, in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His
comprehension catching up with his senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first
time in his life.
“Are you all right?” asked Dumbledore, looking down at him solicitously. “The sensation does
take some getting used to.”
“I’m fine,” said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather
reluctantly. “But I think I might prefer brooms…”
Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck, and said,
“This way.”
He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby
church, it was almost midnight.
“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Your scar…has it been hurting at all?”
Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.
“No,” he said, “and I’ve been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time
now Voldemort’s getting so powerful again.”
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.
“I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,” said Dumbledore. “Lord Voldemort has finally
realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he
is now employing Occlumency against you.”
“Well, I’m not complaining,” said Harry, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the
startling flashes of insight into Voldemort’s mind.
They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at
Dumbledore again. “Professor?”
“Harry?”
“Er — where exactly are we?”
“This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.”
“And what are we doing here?”
“Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said Dumbledore. “Well, I have lost count of the number
of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are
here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.”
“How can I help with that, sir?”
“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dumbledore vaguely. “Left here, Harry.”
They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All the windows were dark. The odd
chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors, Harry
cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.
“Professor, why couldn’t we just Apparate directly into your old colleague’s house?”
“Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door,” said Dumbledore. “Courtesy
dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most
Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance
—”
“— you can’t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,” said Harry quickly.
“Hermione Granger told me.”
“And she is quite right. We turn left again.”
The church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not
consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established,
he had more pressing questions to ask.
“Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked…”
“Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street. “He has been replaced, as I am
sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror office.”
“Is he…Do you think he’s good?” asked Harry.
“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore. “He is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful
personality than Cornelius.”
“Yes, but I meant —”
“I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of
his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.”
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour
that the Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he
changed it. “And…sir…I saw about Madam Bones.”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore quietly. “A terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think —
ouch.”
He had pointed with his injured hand.
“Professor, what happened to your…?”
“I have no time to explain now,” said Dumbledore. “It is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.”
He smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being snubbed, and that he had permission
to keep asking questions.
“Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take
against the Death Eaters…”
“Yes, I received one myself,” said Dumbledore, still smiling. “Did you find it useful?”
“Not really.”
“No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to
check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.”
“I didn’t…” Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.
“For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry…although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would
have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.”
“Er…right,” said Harry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are
they? The leaflet wasn’t very clear.”
“They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a
Dark wizard’s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was
last powerful…He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place,
Harry, just here…”
They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Harry was too busy digesting
the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front
gate, Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him.
“Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.”
Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. The front door
was hanging off its hinges.
Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite deserted.
“Wand out and follow me, Harry,” he said quietly.
He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then
pushed the front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.
“Lumos.”
Dumbledore’s wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway. To the left, another door
stood open. Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with
Harry right behind him.
A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face
cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its
keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby. Cushions lay
deflated, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over
everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls,
where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harry’s small intake of
breath made Dumbledore look around.
“Not pretty, is it?” he said heavily. “Yes, something horrible has happened here.”
Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet.
Harry followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the
piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.
“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off, Professor?” Harry suggested, trying
not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway
up the walls.
“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its
side.
“You mean he’s —?”
“Still here somewhere? Yes.”
And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the
overstuffed armchair, which yelled, “Ouch!”
“Good evening, Horace,” said Dumbledore, straightening up again.
Harry’s jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now
crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at
Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.
“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. “It
hurt.”
The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike
mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of
lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore’s chin.
“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He
seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an
armchair.
“My dear Horace,” said Dumbledore, looking amused, “if the Death Eaters really had come to
call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house.”
The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.
“The Dark Mark,” he muttered. “Knew there was something…ah well. Wouldn’t have had time
anyway, I’d only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.”
He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter.
“Would you like my assistance clearing up?” asked Dumbledore politely.
“Please,” said the other.
They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in
one identical sweeping motion.
The furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments re-formed in midair, feathers zoomed
into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns
soared onto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew
glittering across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes
healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.
“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the
newly unsmashed grandfather flock.
“On the walls? Dragon,” shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and
tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.
There was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.
“Yes, dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally. “My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at
the moment. Still, it might be reusable.”
He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the
light, examining the thick liquid within.
“Hmm. Bit dusty.”
He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.
“Oho,” he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry’s forehead and the lightning-shaped scar it
bore. “Oho!”
“This,” said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the introduction, “is Harry Potter. Harry,
this is an old Friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.”
Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd. “So that’s how you thought you’d
persuade me, is it? Well, the answer’s no, Albus.”
He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist
temptation.
“I suppose we can have a drink, at least?” asked Dumbledore. “For old time’s sake?”
Slughorn hesitated.
“All right then, one drink,” he said ungraciously.
Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn
had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly
glowing oil lamp. Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumbledore, for some
reason, wanted to keep him as visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with
decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.
“Hmpf,” he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. “Here —” He
gave a drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and
then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they
did not touch the floor.
“Well, how have you been keeping, Horace?” Dumbledore asked.
“Not so well,” said Slughorn at once. “Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can’t move like I
used to. Well, that’s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.”
“And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short
notice,” said Dumbledore. “You can’t have had more than three minutes’ warning?”
Slughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, “Two. Didn’t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was
taking a bath. Still,” he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, “the fact remains
that I’m an old man, Albus. A tired old man who’s earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature
comforts.”
He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet
nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books,
boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have
guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.
“You’re not yet as old as I am, Horace,” said Dumbledore.
“Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,” said Slughorn bluntly. His pale
gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore’s injured hand. “Reactions not what they were, I see.”
“You’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those
burned and blackened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly.
“I am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand…”
He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and
Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was
large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had
cracked down the middle. Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a
tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.
“So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace…are they for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or
mine?” asked Dumbledore.
“What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me?” demanded
Slughorn.
“I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and
murder,” said Dumbledore. “Are you really telling me that they haven’t come recruiting yet?”
Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, “I haven’t given them the
chance. I’ve been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from
Muggle house to Muggle house — the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands —
it’s been very pleasant, I’ll be sorry to leave. It’s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing
Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneako-scopes and make sure the
neighbors don’t spot you bringing in the piano.”
“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old
buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts —”
“If you’re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can
save your breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since
Dolores Umbridge left! If that’s how you treat teachers these days —”
“Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” said Dumbledore. “I think you, Horace,
would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-
breeds.’”
“That’s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn. “Idiotic woman. Never liked her.”
Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him.
“Sorry,” Harry said hastily. “It’s just — I didn’t like her either.”
Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly.
“Are you leaving?” asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.
“No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,” said Dumbledore.
“Oh,” said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. “Second on the left down the hall.”
Dumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence.
After a few moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He
shot a furtive look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide
behind.
“Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you,” he said abruptly.
Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn’s watery eyes slid over Harry’s scar, this time taking
in the rest of his face.
“You look very like your father.”
“Yeah, I’ve been told,” said Harry.
“Except for your eyes. You’ve got —”
“My mother’s eyes, yeah.” Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing.
“Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine.
Your mother,” Slughorn added, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the
brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have
been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.”
“Which was your House?”
“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” he went on quickly, seeing the expression
on Harry’s face and wagging a stubby ringer at him, “don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be
Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of
Sirius Black? You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few
weeks ago —”
It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry’s intestines and held them tight.
“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at school. The whole Black family had been in
my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame — he was a talented boy. I got his brother,
Regulus, when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.”
He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in
memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his
backside.
“Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’t believe it when I found out. Thought she
must have been pure-blood, she was so good.”
“One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry, “and she’s the best in our year.”
“Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?” said Slughorn.
“Not really,” said Harry coldly.
Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. “You mustn’t think I’m prejudiced!” he said. “No, no,
no! Haven’t I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students? And there was Dirk
Cresswell in the year after her too — now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course — another
Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on
at Gringotts!”
He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way, and pointed at the many
glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.
“All ex-students, all signed. You’ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he’s always
interested to hear my take on the day’s news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper
every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkisss who gave
him his first job! And at the back — you’ll see her if you just crane your neck — that’s Gwenog
Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies…People are always astonished to hear I’m on
first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!”
This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.
“And all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff?” asked Harry, who could not
help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets,
Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him.
The smile slid from Slughorn’s face as quickly as the blood from his walls.
“Of course not,” he said, looking down at Harry. “I have been out of touch with everybody for a
year.”
Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled
for a moment. Then he shrugged.
“Still…the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to
talk, but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public
allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very admirable and brave and all
the rest of it, I don’t personally fancy the mortality rate —”
“You don’t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,” said Harry, who could not quite keep a
note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn’s cosseted existence when
he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats. “Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and
none of them has ever been killed — well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved
seeing as he was working with Voldemort.”
Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear
Voldemort’s name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk
of protest, which Harry ignored.
“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore’s headmaster; he’s supposed to
be the only one Voldemort ever feared, isn’t he?” Harry went on.
Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to be thinking over Harry’s words.
“Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has never sought a fight with
Dumbledore,” he muttered grudgingly. “And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the
Death Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend…in which case, I might
well be safer a little closer to Albus…I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’s death did not shake
me…If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection…”
Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the
house.
“Oh, there you are, Albus,” he said. “You’ve been a very long lime. Upset stomach?”
“No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,” said Dumbledore. “I do love knitting
patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace’s hospitality quite long enough; I think it is
time for us to leave.”
Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn sinned taken aback.
“You’re leaving?”
“Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.”
“Lost…?”
Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore
fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.
“Well, I’m sorry you don’t want the job, Horace,” said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand
in a farewell salute. “Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased
security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to.”
“Yes…well…very gracious…as I say…”
“Good-bye, then.”
“Bye,” said Harry.
They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.
“All right, all right, I’ll do it!”
Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.
“You will come out of retirement?”
“Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently. “I must be mad, but yes.”
“Wonderful,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Then, Horace, we shall see you on the first of
September.”
“Yes, I daresay you will,” grunted Slughorn.
As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn’s voice floated after them, “I’ll want a pay rise,
Dumbledore!”
Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind them, and they set off back down
the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.
“Well done, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
“I didn’t do anything,” said Harry in surprise.
“Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to
Hogwarts. Did you like him?”
“Er…”
Harry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his
way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a
Muggle-born should make a good witch.
“Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, “likes his
comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the
feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers
the backseat — more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts,
sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had
an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various
fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making
introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in
return, whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next
junior member of the Goblin liaison Office.”
Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it,
twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.
“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to turn you against Horace — or, as we must
now call him, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to
collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; ‘the Boy Who Lived’…or, as they call
you these days, ‘the Chosen One.’”
At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry. He
was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular
meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survives…
Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier.
“This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.”
Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the
pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane
beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in
the world: the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits
could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there…and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could
cook better than anyone he knew…
“If you don’t mind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, “I’d like a few
words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?”
Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their
broomsticks. A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a
little smaller than the average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it
glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.
“I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how
well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I
think Sirius would have been proud of you.”
Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did not think he could stand to
discuss Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and
even worse to hear Sirius’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn.
“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly, “that you and Sirius had such a short time together. A
brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.”
Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledore’s hat. He could
tell that Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had
spent nearly all his time at the Dursleys’ lying on his bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted
window, full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors.
“It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to realize he won’t write to me again.”
His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he
had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had
been one of the best things about discovering his godfather…and now the post owls would never
bring him that comfort again…
“Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before,” said Dumbledore gently.
“Naturally, the loss is devastating…”
“But while I was at the Dursleys’…” interrupted Harry, his voice growing stronger, “I realized I
can’t shut myself away or — or crack up. Sirius wouldn’t have wanted that, would he? And anyway,
life’s too short…Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance…It could be me next, couldn’t it?
But if it is,” he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the
wandlight, “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can
manage it.”
“Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and Sirius’s true godson!” said Dumbledore,
with an approving pat on Harry’s back. “I take my hat off to you — or I would, if I were not afraid
of showering you in spiders.
“And now, Harry, on a closely related subject…I gather that you have been taking the Daily
Prophet over the last two weeks?”
“Yes,” said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster.
“Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your
adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?”
“Yes,” said Harry again. “And now everyone knows that I’m the one —”
“No, they do not,” interrupted Dumbledore. “There are only two people in the whole world
who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and they are both
standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly,
that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.
“Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the
prophecy said?”
“No,” said Harry.
“A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. “Although I think you ought to relax it in
favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,” he continued, when
Harry looked startled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding
something this important to them.”
“I didn’t want —”
“— to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore, surveying Harry over the top of his half-
moon spectacles. “Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need
your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.”
Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to require an answer. He continued, “On a
different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.”
“Private — with you?” said Harry, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.
“Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education.”
“What will you be teaching me, sir?”
“Oh, a little of this, a little of that,” said Dumbledore airily.
Harry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not elaborate, so ho asked something else that had
been bothering him slightly.
“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I?”
‘‘Professor Snape, Harry — and no, you will not.”
“Good,” said Harry in relief, “because they were a —”
He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.
“I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” said Dumbledore, nodding.
Harry laughed.
“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor Snape from now on,” he said, “because he
won’t let me carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding’ in my OWL., which I know I haven’t.”
“Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said Dumbledore gravely. “Which, now I
think of it, ought to be some time later today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part.
“Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment
onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand me?”
Harry nodded.
“And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of
Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and
Molly — all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do
not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment
if you risked your neck while staying with them.”
“I understand,” said Harry quickly.
“Very well, then,” said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into
the yard. “I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore
how thin you are.”
CHAPTER FIVE
AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the
familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of
sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw
sudden movement behind the kitchen window.
“Who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. Weasley’s. “Declare yourself!”
“It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.”
The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wearing an old green
dressing gown.
“Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not to expect you before morning!”
“We were lucky,” said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the threshold. “Slughorn proved much
more persuadable than I had expected. Harry’s doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!”
Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour.
A young witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching
a large mug between her hands.
“Hello, Professor,” she said. “Wotcher, Harry.”
“Hi, Tonks.”
Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in her smile.
Certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubble-gum-
pink hair.
“I’d better be off,” she said quickly, standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders.
“Thanks for the tea and sympathy, Molly”
“Please don’t leave on my account,” said Dumbledore courteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent
matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.”
“No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting Dumbledore’s eyes. “‘Night…”
“Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and Mad-Eye are coming…?”
“No, really, Molly…thanks anyway…Good night, everyone.”
Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she
turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.
“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Take care of yourself. Molly,
your servant.”
He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs.
Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full
glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.
“You’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and down. “Both of you look as though you’ve
had Stretching jinxes put on you. I swear Ron’s grown four inches since I last bought him school
robes. Are you hungry, Harry?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he was,
“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.”
As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled
there, purring.
“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears.
“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with
her wand. It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. “Everyone’s in
bed, of course, we didn’t expect you for hours. Here you are…”
She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley
slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in lime to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.
“Bread, dear?”
“Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.”
She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the
table; as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down
opposite him.
“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?”
Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.
“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He was at Hogwarts for ages, started around
the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?”
His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.
“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. “Of course he can be charming
when he wants to be, but Arthur’s never liked him much. The Ministry’s littered with Slughorn’s old
favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had much time for Arthur…didn’t seem
to think he was enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes. I
don’t know whether Ron’s told you in any of his letters…it’s only just happened…but Arthur’s been
promoted!”
It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.
Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering.
“That’s great!” he gasped.
“You are sweet,” beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the
news. “Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and
Arthur’s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and
Protective Objects. It’s a big job, he’s got ten people reporting to him now!”
“What exactly?”
“Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for
sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters.
You can imagine the kind of thing…so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of
bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off…Well,
in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Fletcher, who’ve never done an honest
day’s work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and
then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed
Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it’s a very important
job, and I tell him it’s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that
Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry
suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.
“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Harry asked.
“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late…He said he’d be back around midnight…”
She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the
washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed
with the name of a family member, and usually hung on the Weasleys’ sitting room wall, though its
current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her.
Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at “mortal peril.”
“It’s been like that for a while now,” said Mrs. Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, “ever
since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I suppose everybody’s in mortal danger now…I
don’t think it can be just our family…but I don’t know anyone else who’s got a clock like this, so I
can’t check. Oh!”
With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’s face. Mr. Weasley’s hand had switched to
“traveling.”
“He’s coming!”
And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up
and hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called
softly, “Arthur, is that you?”
“Yes,” came Mr. Weasley’s weary voice. “But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear.
Ask the question!”
“Oh, honestly…”
“Molly!”
“All right, all right…What is your dearest ambition?”
“To find out how airplanes stay up.”
Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight
to it on the other side, because the door remained firmly shut.
“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!”
“Arthur, really, this is just silly…”
“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone together?”
Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red;
he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his
spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.
“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.
“Correct,” said Mr. Weasley. “Now you can let me in.”
Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing
horn-rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak.
“I still don’t see why we have to go through that every time you come home,” said Mrs. Weasley,
still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. “I mean, a Death Eater might have
forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!”
“I know, dear, but it’s Ministry procedure, and I have to set an example. Something smells
good…onion soup?”
Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.
“Harry! We didn’t expect you until morning!”
They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a
bowl of soup in front of him too.
“Thanks, Molly. It’s been a tough night. Some idiot’s started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just
sling them around your neck and you’ll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred
thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons!”
“And what really happens when you put them on?”
“Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted
tentacle like warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo’s didn’t have enough to do already!”
“It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny,” said Mrs. Weasley
hesitantly. “Are you sure…?”
“Of course I am!” said Mr. Weasley. “The boys wouldn’t do anything like that now, not when
people are desperate for protection!”
“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?”
“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the
Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there…”
Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.
“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. “I’ve got Fred and George’s room all ready for
you, you’ll have it to yourself.”
“Why, where are they?”
“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they’re so busy,”
said Mrs. Weasley. “I must say, I didn’t approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for
business! Come on, dear, your trunks already up there.”
“‘Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, pushing back his chair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his
lap and slunk out of the room.
“G’night, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley.
Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the
hands were once again at “mortal peril.”
Fred and George’s bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp
on the bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a
large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could
not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of
floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which
stood Harry’s school trunk. The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.
Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off
through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade
Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. There was something hard
inside the pillowcase. He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-orange sweet, which he
recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.
Seconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as
the door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The
dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding them with one hand, he groped
hopelessly for his glasses with the other.
“Wuzzgoinon?”
“We didn’t know you were here already!” said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp
blow to the top of the head.
“Ron, don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice reproachfully.
Harry’s hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though the light was so bright he could
hardly see anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and
Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.
“All right?”
“Never been better,” said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows.
“You?”
“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. “When did you get here?
Mum’s only just told us!”
“About one o’clock this morning.”
“Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?”
“Same as usual,” said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed, “they didn’t
talk to me much, but I like it better that way. How’re you, Hermione?”
“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for
something. He thought he knew what was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Sirius’s
death or any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’s the time? Have I missed
breakfast?”
“Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,” said
Ron, rolling his eyes. “So, what’s been going on?”
“Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle’s, haven’t I?”
“Come off it!” said Ron. “You’ve been off with Dumbledore!”
“It wasn’t that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of
retirement. His name’s Horace Slughorn.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking disappointed. “We thought…”
Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.
“…we thought it’d be something like that.”
“You did?” said Harry, amused.
“Yeah…yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts
teacher, don’t we? So, er, what’s he like?”
“He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of Slytherin,” said Harry. “Something
wrong, Hermione?”
She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any
moment. She rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile.
“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he’ll be a good teacher?”
“Dunno,” said Harry. “He can’t be worse than Umbridge, can he?”
“I know someone who’s worse than Umbridge,” said a voice from the doorway. Ron’s younger
sister slouched into the room, looking irritable. “Hi, Harry.”
“What’s up with you?” Ron asked.
“It’s her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry’s bed. “She’s driving me mad.”
“What’s she done now?” asked Hermione sympathetically.
“It’s the way she talks to me…you’d think I was about three!”
“I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She’s so full of herself.”
Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not
blame Ron for saying angrily, “Can’t you two lay off her for five seconds?”
“Oh, that’s right, defend her,” snapped Ginny. “We all know you can’t get enough of her.”
This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s mother. Starting to feel that he was missing
something, Harry said, “Who are you…?”
But his question was answered before he could finish it. The bedroom door flew open again, and
Harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off
the bed onto the floor.
A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the
room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and
appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a
heavily laden breakfast tray.
“’Arry,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ‘as been too long!”
As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her
wake, looking rather cross.
“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!”
“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across Harry’s knees and then
swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. “I
‘ave been longing to see ‘im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about
‘Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.”
“Oh…is she here too?” Harry croaked.
“No, no, silly boy,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I mean next summer, when we…but do
you not know?”
Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said,
“We hadn’t got around to telling him yet.”
Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley
across the face.
“Bill and I are going to be married!”
“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny
were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze. “Wow. Er…congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ‘ard, and I only work part-time at Gringotts for
my Eenglish, so he brought me ‘ere for a few days to get to know ‘is family properly. I was so pleased
to ‘ear you would be coming…zere isn’t much to do ‘ere, unless you like cooking and chickens!
Well…enjoy your breakfast, ‘Arry!”
With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room, closing the door
quietly behind her.
Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like, “tchah!”
“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. “I just think they’ve hurried into this
engagement, that’s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the
closed door.
“Well, that’s not very long! I know why it’s happened, of course. Its all this uncertainty with
You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they’re rushing all
sorts of decisions they’d normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people
eloping left, right, and center…”
“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly.
“Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting?” said Mrs.
Weasley. “Whereas Bill and Fleur…well…what have they really got in common? He’s a
hardworking, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she’s…”
“A cow,” said Ginny, nodding. “But Bill’s not that down-to-earth. He’s a Curse-Breaker, isn’t
he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour…I expect that’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.”
“Stop calling her that, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed.
“Well, I’d better get on…Eat your eggs while they’re warm, Harry.”
Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his
head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water.
“Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same house?” Harry asked.
“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then…”
“It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and
turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.
“You don’t really want her around forever?” Ginny asked Ron incredulously. When he merely
shrugged, she said, “Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.”
“How’s she going to manage that?” asked Harry.
“She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she’s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks
instead. I hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family.”
“Yeah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically. “Listen, no bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy
Tonks when Fleur’s around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking when she isn’t doing stupid things to
her hair and her nose, but…”
“She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm?” said Ginny.
“And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!” said Hermione from the corner.
“Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament,” said Harry.
“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly.
“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry,’ do you?” asked Ginny scornfully.
“No,” said Harry, wishing he hadn’t spoken, “I was just saying, Phlegm…I mean, Fleur…”
“I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said Ginny. “At least she’s a laugh.”
“She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said Ron. “Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more
like Moaning Myrtle.”
“That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’t got over what happened…you know…I
mean, he was her cousin!”
Harry’s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a fork and began shoveling
scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the
conversation.
“Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron. “Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and
before that their families never met…”
“That’s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it was her fault he died!”
“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry, in spite of himself.
“Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t she? I think she feels that if only she had
finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.”
“That’s stupid,” said Ron.
“It’s survivor’s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’s tried to talk her round, but she’s still
really down. She’s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!”
“With her…?”
“She can’t change her appearance like she used to,” explained Hermione. “I think her powers
must have been affected by shock, or something.”
“I didn’t know that could happen,” said Harry.
“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re really depressed…”
The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in. “Ginny,” she whispered, “come
downstairs and help me with the lunch.”
“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny, outraged.
“Now!” said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew.
“She only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be alone with Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly. She
swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with
her arms held aloft like a ballerina.
“You lot had better come down quickly too,” she said as she left.
Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast. Hermione was peering into
Fred and George’s boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who
was now helping himself to Harry’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.
“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a small telescope.
“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George left it here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop
yet, so be careful”
“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. “Said Fred and George have got a real flair
for business.”
“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking in the Galleons! I can’t wait to see the
place, we haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dad’s got to be there for extra
security and he’s been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.”
“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the
rest of the family. “Is he talking to your mum and dad again?”
“Nope,” said Ron.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back —”
“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,”
said Hermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.”
“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say,” said Ron.
“He’s going to be giving me private lessons this year,” said Harry conversationally.
Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.
“You kept that quiet!” said Ron.
“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly. “He told me last night in your broom shed.”
“Blimey…private lessons with Dumbledore!” said Ron, looking impressed. “I wonder why
he’s…?”
His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife
and fork, his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed.
Dumbledore had said to do it…Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in
the sunlight streaming into his lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to be giving me
lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.”
Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression that both had frozen. He
continued, still speaking to his fork, “You know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.”
“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione quickly. “It got smashed.”
“Although the Prophet says…” began Ron, but Hermione said, “Shh!”
“The Prophet’s got it right,” said Harry, looking up at them both with a great effort: Hermione
seemed frightened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that smashed wasn’t the only record of the
prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’s office, he was the one the prophecy was made
to, so he could tell me. From what it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it looks like I’m the one
who’s got to finish off Voldemort…At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives.”
The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there was a loud bang
and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke.
“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.
Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a
brilliantly purple black eye.
“I squeezed it and it…it punched me!” she gasped.
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the
telescope.
“Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, “Mum’ll fix that, she’s good at
healing minor injuries…”
“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione hastily. “Harry, oh, Harry…”
She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
“We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry…Obviously, we didn’t want to say
anything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and
Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like this…Oh, Harry…” She stared at him, then
whispered, “Are you scared?”
“Not as much as I was,” said Harry. “When I first heard it, I was…but now, it seems as though I
always knew I’d have to face him in the end…”
“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you
something or showing you something to do with the prophecy,” said Ron eagerly. “And we were
kind of right, weren’t we? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner,
wouldn’t waste his time — he must think you’ve got a chance!”
“That’s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive
magic, probably…powerful countercurses…anti-jinxes…”
Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with
the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and
Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there
on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were
contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.
“…and evasive enchantments generally,” concluded Hermione. “Well, at least you know one
lesson you’ll be having this year, that’s one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our OWL results
will come?”
“Can’t be long now, it’s been a month,” said Ron.
“Hang on,” said Harry, as another part of last night’s conversation came back to him. “I think
Dumbledore said our OWL results would be arriving today!”
“Today?” shrieked Hermione. “Today? But why didn’t you…oh my God…you should have
said…”
She leapt to her feet.
“I’m going to see whether any owls have come…”
But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully dressed and carrying his empty
breakfast tray, it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs.
Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.
“It just won’t budge,” Mrs. Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Hermione with her
wand in her hand and a copy of The Healer’s Helpmate open at “Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.”
“This has always worked before, I just can’t understand it.”
“It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, making sure it can’t come off,” said Ginny.
“But it’s got to come off!” squeaked Hermione. “I can’t go around looking like this forever!”
“You won’t, dear, we’ll find an antidote, don’t worry,” said Mrs. Weasley soothingly.
“Bill told me Fred and George are very amusing!” said Fleur, smiling serenely.
“Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped Hermione.
She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.
“Mrs. Weasley, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this morning?”
“Yes, dear, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. Weasley patiently. “But it’s barely nine, there’s still
plenty of time…”
“I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered Hermione feverishly, “I definitely made at least
one serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I
thought Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking back —”
“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one who’s nervous!” barked Ron. “And when
you’ve got your eleven ‘Outstanding’ OWLs…”
“Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said Hermione, flapping her hands hysterically. “I know I’ve failed
everything!”
“What happens if we fail?” Harry asked the room at large, but it was again Hermione who
answered.
“We discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of
last term.”
Harry’s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten less breakfast.
“At Beauxbatons,” said Fleur complacently, “we ‘ad a different way of doing things. I think eet
was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then…”
Fleur’s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was pointing through the kitchen window.
Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time.
“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Hermione at the window.
“And there are three of them,” said Harry, hastening to her other side.
“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Oh no…oh no…oh no…”
She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows.
The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became
clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.
“Oh no!” squealed Hermione.
Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls
soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.
Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle.
He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach his own results; to his right,
Hermione’s hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble.
Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed to detach the envelope. He slit it open
quickly and unfolded the parchment inside.
Ordinary Wizarding Level Results
Pass Grades:
Outstanding (O)
Exceeds Expectations (E)
Acceptable (A)
Fail Grades:
Poor (P)
Dreadful (D)
Troll (T)
Harry James Potter has achieved:
Astronomy: A
Care of Magical Creatures: E
Charms: E
Defense Against the Dark Arts: O
Divination: P
Herbology: E
History of Magic: D
Potions: E
Transfiguration: E
Harry read the parchment through several times, his breathing becoming easier with each
reading. It was all right: He had always known that he would fail Divination, and he had had no
chance of passing History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination,
but he had passed everything else! He ran his finger down the grades…he had passed well in
Transfiguration and Herbology, he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And best of all, he
had achieved “Outstanding” at Defense Against the Dark Arts!
He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was looking
delighted.
“Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares about them?” he said happily to
Harry. “Here…swap…”
Harry glanced down Ron’s grades: There were no “Outstandings” there…
“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said Ron, punching Harry on the
shoulder. “We’ve done all right, haven’t we?”
“Well done!” said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron’s hair. “Seven OWLs, that’s more than
Fred and George got together!”
“Hermione?” said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still hadn’t turned around. “How did you
do?”
“I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice.
“Oh, come off it,” said Ron, striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. “Yep
— nine ‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He
looked down at her, half-amused, half-exasperated. “You’re actually disappointed, aren’t you?”
Hermione shook her head, but Harry laughed.
“Well, we’re N.E.W.T. students now!” grinned Ron. “Mum, are there any more sausages?”
Harry looked back down at his results. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt
just one tiny twinge of regret…This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not
secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he wouldn’t, but he still felt a
sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E.
It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he
would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn’t really
think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since
he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago…Neither can live while the other survives…Wouldn’t he
be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly
trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort?
CHAPTER SIX
DRACO’S DETOUR
Harry remained within the confines of the Burrow’s garden over the next few weeks. He spent
most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys’ orchard (he and Hermione against
Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched)
and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.
It would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for the stones of disappearances,
odd accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Bill and Mr.
Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure,
Harry’s sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus
Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more
ragged and patched than ever.
“There have been another couple of dementor attacks,” he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed
him a large slice of birthday cake. “And they’ve found Igor Karkaroff’s body in a shack up north.
The Dark Mark had been set over it…well, frankly, I’m surprised he stayed alive for even a year after
deserting the Death Eaters; Sirius’s brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can
remember.”
“Yes, well,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, “perhaps we should talk about something diff…”
“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?” asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by
Fleur. “The man who ran…”
“— the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow
sensation in the pit of his stomach. “He used to give me free ice creams. What’s happened to him?”
“Dragged off, by the look of his place.”
“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.
“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow. He was a good man, Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily
or was kidnapped.”
“But what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the best, and if the other
side have got him it’s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts.
Harry’s included a surprise: he had been made Quidditch Captain.
“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried Hermione happily. “You can use our special
bathroom now and everything!”
“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” said Ron, examining the badge with glee.
“Harry, this is so cool, you’re my Captain…if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha…”
“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you’ve got these,”
sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Ron’s booklist. “We’ll go on Saturday as long as your father
doesn’t have to go into work again. I’m not going there without him.”
“Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know-Who’s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in
Flourish and Blotts?” sniggered Ron.
“Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?” said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. “If
you think security’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and I’ll get your things myself…”
“No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George’s shop!” said Ron hastily.
“Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide you’re too immature to come
with us!” said Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still
pointing at “mortal peril,” and balancing it on top of a pile of just-laundered towels. “And that goes
for returning to Hogwarts as well!”
Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the
teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room.
“Blimey…you can’t even make a joke round here anymore…”
But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday
dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast.
Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginny’s pleasure), passed a
full money bag across the table to Harry.
“Where’s mine?” demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide.
“That’s already Harry’s, idiot,” said Bill. “I got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because it’s
taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened
security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his…Well, trust me,
this way’s easier.”
“Thanks, Bill,” said Harry, pocketing his gold.
“’E is always so thoughtful,” purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill’s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting
into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.
It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had
ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling
on their cloaks.
“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car
moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He,
Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.
“Don’t get used to it, it’s only because of Harry,” said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and
Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly
stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa. “He’s been given top-grade security status. And we’ll
be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.”
Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion
of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good
enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think
of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak.
“Here you are, then,” said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time
as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for you,
any idea how long you’ll be?”
“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, good, he’s here!”
Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt. There were no
Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the
Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry’s face and
oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.
“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped
out of the car. “Buckbeak…Witherwings, I mean…yeh should see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be
back in the open air…”
“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. “We didn’t know ‘security’
meant you!”
“I know, jus’ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o’ Aurors, but
Dumbledore said I’d do,” said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into
his pockets. “Lets get goin’ then…after yeh, Molly, Arthur…”
The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’s memory, completely empty. Only Tom
the landlord, wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they
entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, “Jus’ passin’ through today, Tom, sure
yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know.”
Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the
Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the
dustbins stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened
at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and
paused, looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion
ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that
had been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the
security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore
moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange
was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including
those of Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking stalls
had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts,
under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front:
AMULETS
Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi!
A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.
“One for your little girl, madam?” he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny.
“Protect her pretty neck?”
“If I were on duty…” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.
“Yes, but don’t go arresting anyone now, dear, we’re in a hurry,” said Mrs. Weasley, nervously
consulting a list. “I think we’d better do Madam Malkin’s first, Hermione wants new dress robes,
and Ron’s showing much too much ankle in his school robes, and you must need new ones too,
Harry, you’ve grown so much…come on, everyone…”
“Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin’s,” said Mr. Weasley. “Why
don’t those three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone’s school-
books?”
“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping
quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack. “Hagrid, do you think —?”
“Don’t fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said Hagrid soothingly, waving an airy hand the size
of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying
off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and
Hagrid set off for Madam Malkin’s.
Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as
Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their
own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping
alone.
“Migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,” said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam
Malkin’s and bending down to peer through the window. “I’ll stand guard outside, all right?”
So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together. It appeared, at first glance, to be
empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing
from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.
“…not a child, in case you haven’t noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my
shopping alone.”
There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner,
said, “Now, dear, your mother’s quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our
own anymore, it’s nothing to do with being a child…”
“Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!”
A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared from behind the rack,
wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of
the sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed
Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed.
“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,” said Draco Malfoy.
“I don’t think there’s any need for language like that!” said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from
behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. “And I don’t want wands drawn in my
shop either!” she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown her Harry and Ron both
standing there with their wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, who was standing slightly
behind them, whispered, “No, don’t, honestly, it’s not worth it. “
“Yeah, like you’d dare do magic out of school,” sneered Malfoy. “Who blacked your eye,
Granger? I want to send them flowers.”
“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, looking over her shoulder for support.
“Madam, please!”
Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack.
“Put those away,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron. “If you attack my son again, I shall ensure
that it is the last thing you ever do.”
“Really?” said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that, for
all its pallor, still resembled her sister’s. He was as tall as she was now. “Going to get a few Death
Eater pals to do us in, are you?”
Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.
“Really, you shouldn’t accuse…dangerous thing to say…wands away, please!”
But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly.
“I see that being Dumbledore’s favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But
Dumbledore won’t always be there to protect you.”
Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow…look at that…he’s not here now! So why
not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a
husband!”
Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron
laughed loudly.
“Don’t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!” Malfoy snarled.
“It’s all right, Draco,” said Narcissa, restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his
shoulder. “I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.”
Harry raised his wand higher.
“Harry, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side.
“Think…You mustn’t…You’ll be in such trouble…”
Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though
nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn’t. She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring
at Harry.
“I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me just…”
“Ouch!” bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. “Watch where you’re putting your pins,
woman! Mother, I don’t think I want these anymore.”
He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Madam Malkin’s feet.
“You’re right, Draco,” said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at Hermione, “now I know the
kind of scum that shops here…We’ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting’s.”
And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he
could into Ron on the way out.
“Well, really?” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her
wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust.
She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron’s and Harry’s new robes, tried to sell Hermione
wizard’s dress robes instead of witch’s, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with
an air of being glad to see the back of them.
“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side.
“Just about,” said Harry. “Did you see the Malfoys?”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned. “Bu they wouldn’ dare make trouble in the middle o’ Diagon
Alley, Harry. Don’ worry about them.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this
comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of
books.
“Everyone all right?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Got your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the
Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George’s…stick close, now…”
Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no
longer studying Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at
Eeylops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every minute or so, they
headed farther along the street in search of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred
and George.
“We really haven’t got too long,” Mrs. Weasley said. “So we’ll just have a quick look around and
then back to the car. We must be close, that’s number ninety-two…ninety-four…”
“Whoa,” said Ron, stopping in his tracks.
Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop Fronts around them, Fred and Georges windows hit the
eye like a firework display. Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows,
and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a halt, transfixed. The left-hand
window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and
shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to water just looking at it. The right-hand window was covered with a
gigantic poster, purple like those of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:
WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT
YOU-KNOW-WHO?
YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT
U-NO-POO —
THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION
THAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION!
Harry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs.
Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name “U-No-
Poo.”
“They’ll be murdered in their beds!” she whispered.
“No they won’t!” said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. “This is brilliant!”
And he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with customers; Harry could not get
near the shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the
Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts;
Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the
shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs
of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and
boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. A space
cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-
year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows,
both perched on a box that read: Reusable hangman - spell it or he’ll swing!
“‘Patented Daydream Charms…’”
Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading
the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a
swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.
“‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute
daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include
vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens.’ “You know,” said Hermione,
looking up at Harry, “that really is extraordinary magic!”
“For that, Hermione,” said a voice behind them, “you can have one for free.”
A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently
with his flaming hair.
“How are you, Harry?” They shook hands. “And what’s happened to your eye, Hermione?”
“Your punching telescope,” she said ruefully.
“Oh blimey, I forgot about those,” said Fred. “Here —”
He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a
thick yellow paste.
“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone within the hour,” said Fred. “We had to find a decent
bruise remover. We’re testing most of our products on ourselves.”
Hermione looked nervous. “It is safe, isn’t it?” she asked.
“Course it is,” said Fred bracingly. “Come on, Harry, I’ll give you a tour.”
Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the
shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks.
“Muggle magic tricks!” said Fred happily, pointing them out. “For freaks like Dad, you know,
who love Muggle stuff. It’s not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they’re great
novelties…Oh, here’s George…”
Fred’s twin shook Harry’s hand energetically.
“Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, that’s where we’re making the real
money…pocket anything, you, and you’ll pay in more than Galleons!” he added warningly to a
small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled EDIBLE DARK MARKS —THEY’LL
MAKE ANYONE SICK!
George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded
room. The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued.
“We’ve just developed this more serious line,” said Fred. “Funny how it happened…”
“You wouldn’t believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can’t do a
decent Shield Charm,” said George. “‘Course, they didn’t have you teaching them, Harry.”
“That’s right…Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your
mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry
bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we’re still getting massive orders!”
“So we’ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves…”
“…I mean, they wouldn’t help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to
moderate hexes or jinxes…”
“And then we thought we’d get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because
it’s such a money spinner,” continued George enthusiastically. “This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness
Powder, we’re importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a quick escape.”
“And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,” said Fred, pointing at a
number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight.
“You just drop one surreptitiously and it’ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving
you a diversion if you need one.
“Handy,” said Harry, impressed.
“Here,” said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry.
A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Harry saw that she too
was wearing magenta staff robes.
“There’s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,” she
said.
Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called “Mr. Weasley,” but they took it in their
stride.
“Right you are, Verity, I’m coming,” said George promptly. “Harry, you help yourself to
anything you want, all right? No charge.”
“I can’t do that!” said Harry, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy
Detonators.
“You don’t pay here,” said Fred firmly, waving away Harry’s gold.
“But…”
“You gave us our start-up loan, we haven’t forgotten,” said George sternly “Take whatever you
like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.”
George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led Harry back into
the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream
Charms.
“Haven’t you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?” asked Fred. “Follow me,
ladies…”
Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls
was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.
“There you go,” said Fred proudly. “Best range of love potions you’ll find anywhere.”
Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. “Do they work?” she asked.
“Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy
in question…”
“…and the attractiveness of the girl,” said George, reappearing suddenly at their side. “But we’re
not selling them to our sister,” he added, becoming suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got
about five boys on the go from what we’ve…”
“Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a
small pink pot off the shelf. “What’s this?”
“Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,” said Fred. “Excellent on everything from boils to
blackheads, but don’t change the subject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy
called Dean Thomas?”
“Yes, I am,” said Ginny. “And last time I looked, he was definitely one boy, not five. What are
those?”
She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling
around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks.
“Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Miniature puffskeins, we can’t breed them fast enough. So what
about Michael Corner?”
“I dumped him, he was a bad loser,” said Ginny, putting a finger through the bars of the cage
and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. “They’re really cute!”
“They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred. “But you’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast,
aren’t you?”
Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on
her face that Harry was surprised Fred didn’t recoil.
“It’s none of your business. And I’ll thank you” she added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared
at George’s elbow, laden with merchandise, “not to tell tales about me to these two!”
“That’s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,” said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron’s
arms. “Cough up.”
“I’m your brother!”
“And that’s our stuff you’re nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I’ll knock off the Knut.”
“But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!”
“You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.”
Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately
spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear.
“If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fingers together,” she said sharply.
“Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Ginny at once.
“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley warily.
“Look, they’re so sweet…”
Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione
momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street
alone. As he passed Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he
moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him.
“Wonder where his mummy is?” said Harry, frowning.
“Given her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron.
“Why, though?” said Hermione.
Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious
son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.
Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent.
He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley
was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both
helping customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them,
looking up and down the street.
“Get under here, quick,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.
“Oh — I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley.
“Come on,” said Ron.
She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody
noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and George’s products. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained
the street, Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had.
“He was going in that direction,” murmured Harry as quietly as possible, so that the humming
Hagrid would not hear them. “C’mon.”
They scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Hermione
pointed ahead.
“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whispered. “Turning left?”
“Big surprise,” whispered Ron.
For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight.
“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Harry, speeding up.
“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it
was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays.
“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry impatiently. “Just hurry!”
But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They
peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all.
Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark
artifacts — or at least, to be seen buying them.
Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.
“Ouch!”
“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s ear.
They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin
and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls
and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large
black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by the
movements of Malfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin,
an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled
resentment and fear.
“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said Hermione.
“We can!” said Ron excitedly. “Hang on, damn.”
He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest.
“Extendable Ears, look!”
“Fantastic!” said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, flesh-colored strings and began to feed
them toward the bottom of the door. “Oh, I hope the door isn’t Imperturbable…”
“No!” said Ron gleefully. “Listen!”
They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings, through which
Malfoy’s voice could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had been turned on.
“…you know how to fix it?”
“Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. “I’ll need
to see it, though. Why don’t you bring it into the shop?”
“I can’t,” said Malfoy. “It’s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.”
Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.
“Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn’t
guarantee anything.”
“No?” said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. “Perhaps this
will make you more confident.”
He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very
frightened.
“Tell anyone,” said Maifoy, “and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He’s a
family friend. He’ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you’re giving the problem your
full attention.”
“There will be no need for…”
“I’ll decide that,” said Malfoy. “Well, I’d better be off. And don’t forget to keep that one safe, I’ll
need it.”
“Perhaps you’d like to take it now?”
“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the
street? Just don’t sell it.”
“Of course not…sir.”
Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy.
“Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?”
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Borgin, bowing again.
Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking
very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak
flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had
vanished; he looked worried.
“What was that about?” whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.
“Dunno,” said Harry, thinking hard. “He wants something mended…and he wants to reserve
something in there…Could you see what he pointed at when he said ‘that one’?”
“No, he was behind that cabinet…”
“You two stay here,” whispered Hermione.
“What are you…?”
But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the
reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the
Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry.
“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but
cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on
display.
“Is this necklace for sale?” she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case.
“If you’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,” said Mr. Borgin coldly.
“Oh…er…no, I haven’t got quite that much,” said Hermione, walking on. “And…what about
this lovely…um…skull?”
“Sixteen Galleons.”
“So it’s for sale, then? It isn’t being…kept for anyone?”
Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up
to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the
winds.
“The thing is, that…er…boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he’s a friend of
mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he’s already reserved anything, I obviously
don’t want to get him the same thing, so…um…”
It was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.
“Out,” he said sharply. “Get out!”
Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As
the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign.
“Ah well,” said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione. “Worth a try, but you were a bit
obvious…”
“Well, next time you can show me how it’s done, Master of Mystery!” she snapped.
Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they were
forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and
Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility
Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs.
Weasleys accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have
looked properly.
CHAPTER SEVEN
THE SLUG CLUB
Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy’s behavior in
Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy’s face as he had left the
shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance,
however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy’s activities as he was; or
at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.
“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,” said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting
on the windowsill in Fred and George’s room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and
had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. “But haven’t we
agreed there could be a lot of explanations?”
“Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory” said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his
broomstick’s bent tail twigs. “Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?”
“But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep that one safe’?” asked Harry for the
umpteenth time. “That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of the broken objects, and
Malfoy wants both.”
“You reckon?” said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.
“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, “Malfoy’s father’s
in Azkaban. Don’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge?”
Ron looked up, blinking.
“Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?”
“That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, frustrated. “But he’s up to something and I think
we should take it seriously. His father’s a Death Eater and…”
Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling
thought had just occurred to him.
“Harry?” said Hermione in an anxious voice. “What’s wrong?”
“Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?” asked Ron nervously.
“He’s a Death Eater,” said Harry slowly. “He’s replaced his father as a Death Eater!”
There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. “Malfoy? He’s sixteen, Harry! You think You-
Know-Who would let Malfoy join?”
“It seems very unlikely, Harry,” said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. “What makes you
think —?”
“In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her
when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He’s been branded with the Dark Mark.”
Ron and Hermione looked at each other.
“Well…” said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.
“I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,” said Hermione.
“He showed Borgin something we couldn’t see,” Harry pressed on stubbornly. “Something that
seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it…he was showing Borgin who he was dealing
with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!”
Ron and Hermione exchanged another look.
“I’m not sure, Harry…”
“Yeah, I still don’t reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join…”
Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch
robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and
packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her
room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.
“I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned him. “There’s a lot of Phlegm around.”
“I’ll be careful not to slip in it.” Harry smiled.
Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full
flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling
sprouts, looking bad-tempered.
“…Bill and I ‘ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very
sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold, pink would of course be ‘orrible with
Ginny’s ‘air!”
“Ah, Harry!” said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur’s monologue. “Good, I wanted to
explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We’ve got Ministry
cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station.”
“Is Tonks going to be there?” asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things.
“No, I don’t think so, she’s been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said.”
“She has let ‘erself go, zat Tonks,” Fleur mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the
back of a teaspoon. “A big mistake if you ask.”
“Yes, thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. “You’d better get on,
Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don’t have the usual last-minute scramble.”
And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars
glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione’s cat,
Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron’s owl, Pigwidgeon; and
Ginny’s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.
“Aurevoir, ’Arry,” said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking
hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur’s feet. Furious,
red-faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying good-bye.
There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King’s Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced,
bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the
party, marched them into the station without speaking.
“Quick, quick, through the barrier,” said Mrs. Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this
austere efficiency. “Harry had better go first, with…”
She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harry’s upper arm, and
attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
“I can walk, thanks,” said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror’s grip. He pushed his
trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later,
standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching
steam over the crowd.
Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-
faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an
empty compartment.
“We can’t, Harry,” said Hermione, looking apologetic. “Ron and I’ve got to go to the prefects’
carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.”
“Oh yeah, I forgot,” said Harry.
“You’d better get straight on the train, all of you, you’ve only got a few minutes to go,” said Mrs.
Weasley, consulting her watch. “Well, have a lovely term, Ron…”
“Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?” said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the
moment.
“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot
of the others nevertheless.
Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone,
Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the
best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because he thought that there was not too
much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.
He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as
they moved away.
“When we were in Diagon Alley,” Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace.
“Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were
supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?”
“How did you…?”
“Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised Fred and George.”
“Er…yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.”
“Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.”
“Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak.”
“Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?”
“Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,” said Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasley’s look
of mingled exasperation and amusement. “He’d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know
why.”
“Of course you did,” said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned. “Well? Did you find out why?”
“He went into Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry, “and started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin,
to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made
it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. And…”
Harry took a deep breath.
“There’s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch
his left arm. I think he’s been branded with the Dark Mark. I think he’s replaced his father as a
Death Eater.”
Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, “Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-
Who would allow a sixteen-year-old…”
“Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn’t do?” asked Harry angrily.
“Mr. Weasley, I’m sorry, but isn’t it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he
needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something Dark or dangerous, isn’t it?”
“I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley slowly. “You see, when Lucius Malfoy was
arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.”
“I think you missed something,” said Harry stubbornly.
“Well, maybe,” said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him.
There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were
closing.
“You’d better hurry!” said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, “Harry, quickly!”
He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train.
“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all fixed with Dumbledore, so we’ll see you
quite soon,” said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him
and the train began to move. “You make sure you look after yourself and…”
The train was gathering speed.
“…be good and…” She was jogging to keep up now.
“…stay safe!”
Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view,
then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in
the prefects’ carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He
made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.
People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of
their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and
gawping he would have to endure this term after all the “Chosen One” rumors in the Daily Prophet,
but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the
shoulder.
“Fancy trying to find a compartment?”
“I can’t, Harry, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny brightly. “See you later.”
“Right,” said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair
dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost
forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he
blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.
“Hi, Harry!” said a familiar voice from behind him.
“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.
“Hello, Harry,” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.
“Luna, hi, how are you?”
“Very well, thank you,” said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the
front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.
“Quibbler still going strong, then?” asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine,
having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.
“Oh yes, circulation’s well up,” said Luna happily.
“Let’s find seats,” said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of
silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside
gratefully.
“They’re even staring at us?” said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. “Because we’re with
you!”
“They’re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,” said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk
into the luggage rack. “Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must’ve seen it.”
“Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,” said Neville, “but she was really
pleased. Says I’m starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!”
He pulled it out and showed it to Harry.
“Cherry and unicorn hair,” he said proudly. “We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever
sold, he vanished next day…oy, come back here, Trevor!”
And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.
“Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?” asked Luna, who was detaching a pair of
psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.
“No point now we’ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?” said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped
his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.
“I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!”
“I enjoyed the meetings too,” said Luna serenely. “It was like having friends.”
This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a
squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a
disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and
giggling together on the other side of the glass.
“You ask him!”
“No, you! “
“I’ll do it!”
And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair
pushed her way through the door.
“Hi, Harry, I’m Romilda, Romilda Vane,” she said loudly and confidently. “Why don’t you join
us in our compartment? You don’t have to sit with them,” she added in a stage whisper, indicating
Neville’s bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor,
and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented,
multicolored owl.
“They’re friends of mine,” said Harry coldly.
“Oh,” said the girl, looking very surprised. “Oh. Okay.”
And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.
“People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” said Luna, once again displaying her knack
for embarrassing honesty.
“You are cool,” said Harry shortly. “None of them was at the Ministry. They didn’t fight with
me.”
“That’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her
nose and settled down to read The Quibbler.
“We didn’t face him, though,” said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in
his hair and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. “You did. You should hear my gran talk about
you. ‘That Harry Potter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!’ She’d give
anything to have you as a grandson…”
Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could.
While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a
Transfiguration NEWT, with only an “Acceptable,” Harry watched him without really listening.
Neville’s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry’s had, but Neville
had no idea how close he had come to having Harry’s destiny. The prophecy could have referred to
either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was
the one meant.
Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-
shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy…Or would it? Would Neville’s mother have died to save
him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would…But what if she had been unable to stand
between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no “Chosen One” at all? An empty
seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own
mother, not Ron’s?
“You all right, Harry? You look funny,” said Neville.
Harry started. “Sorry…I…”
“Wrackspurt got you?” asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous
colored spectacles.
“I…what?”
“A Wrackspurt…They’re invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go
fuzzy,” she said. “I thought I felt one zooming around in here.”
She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville
caught each other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.
The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed
through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the
clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the
compartment at last.
“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” said Ron longingly, slumping into the
seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. “Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?” he added, turning
to Harry. “Malfoys not doing prefect duty. He’s just sitting in his compartment with the other
Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.”
Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his
power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.
“What did he do when he saw you?”
“The usual,” said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand gesture. “Not like him, though,
is it? Well…that is”— he did the hand gesture again — “but why isn’t he out there bullying first
years?”
“Dunno,” said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn’t this look as though Malfoy had more
important things on his mind than bullying younger students?
“Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,” said Hermione. “Maybe being a prefect seems a
bit tame after that.”
“I don’t think so,” said Harry. “I think he’s —”
But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a
breathless third-year girl stepped inside.
“I’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,” she faltered, as her
eyes met Harry’s and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with
violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl
stumbled back out of the compartment.
“What is it?” Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.
“An invitation,” said Harry.
Harry,
I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.
Sincerely,
Professor H. E. F. Slughorn
“But what does he want me for?” asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.
“No idea,” said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch
was correct. “Listen,” he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, “let’s go under the Invisibility Cloak,
then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he’s up to.”
This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the
lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it
regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the
staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train.
Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him.
The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As
Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta,
who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of
pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.
When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn’s only
invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn’s welcome, Harry was the most warmly
anticipated.
“Harry, m’boy!” said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered
belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery
mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat. “Good to see
you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!”
Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other
in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow
guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long,
slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner
beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.
“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. “Blaise Zabini is in your
year, of course —”
Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor
and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.
“This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you’ve come across each other —? No?”
McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at
him.
“—and this is Marcus Belby, I don’t know whether —?”
Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.
“— and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!” Slughorn finished.
Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn’s back.
“Well now, this is most pleasant,” said Slughorn cozily. “A chance to get to know you all a little
better. Here, take a napkin. I’ve packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on
licorice wands, and a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up to such things…Pheasant,
Belby?”
Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.
“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,”
Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. “Outstanding wizard,
outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?”
Unfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer
Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.
“Anapneo,” said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at
once.
“Not…not much of him, no,” gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.
“Well, of course, I daresay he’s busy,” said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. “I doubt he
invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!”
“I suppose…” said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure
that Slughorn had finished with him. “Er…he and my dad don’t get on very well, you see, so I don’t
really know much about…”
His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead.
“Now, you, Cormac,” said Slughorn, “I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius,
because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?”
“Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,” said McLaggen. “We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus
Scrimgeour; this was before he became Minister, obviously —”
“Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?” beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of
pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. “Now tell me…”
It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were
connected to somebody well-known or influential — everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was
interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what
Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously
and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville’s turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten
minutes, for Neville’s parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix
Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Neville’s interview, Harry had the
impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his
parents’ flair.
“And now,” said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing
his star act. “Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over
the summer!” He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and
succulent piece of pheasant, then said, “‘The Chosen One,’ they’re calling you now!”
Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.
“Of course,” said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, “there have been rumors for years…I
remember when…well — after that terrible night — Lily — James — and you survived — and the
word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary —”
Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism. An angry
voice burst out from behind Slughorn.
“Yeah, Zabini, because you’re so talented…at posing…”
“Oh dear!” chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini
around Slughorn’s great belly. “You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the
most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn’t cross her!”
Zabini merely looked contemptuous.
“Anyway,” said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. “Such rumors this summer. Of course, one
doesn’t know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes —
but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the
Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!”
Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing.
Slughorn beamed at him.
“So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond — you were there, then? But the rest
of the stories — so sensational, of course, one doesn’t know quite what to believe — this fabled
prophecy, for instance —”
“We never heard a prophecy,” said Neville, turning geranium pink as he said it.
“That’s right,” said Ginny staunchly. “Neville and I were both there too, and all this ‘Chosen
One’ rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.”
“You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to
Neville, but both of them sat clam-like before his encouraging smile.
“Yes…well…it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of course…” Slughorn said, sounding a
little disappointed. “I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain
of the Holyhead Harpies) —”
He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that
Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.
The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of
whom had been delighted to join what he called the “Slug Club” at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait
to leave, but couldn’t see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long
misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.
“Good gracious, it’s getting dark already! I didn’t notice that they’d lit the lamps! You’d better
go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on
nogtails. Harry, Blaise — any time you’re passing. Same goes for you, miss,” he twinkled at Ginny.
“Well, off you go, off you go!”
As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry
returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.
“I’m glad that’s over,” muttered Neville. “Strange man, isn’t he?”
“Yeah, he is a bit,” said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. “How come you ended up in there, Ginny?”
“He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said Ginny. “You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who
was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he
annoyed me so much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to get
detention, but he just thought it was; it really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?”
“Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother’s famous,” said Harry, scowling at
the back of Zabini’s head, “or because their uncle —”
But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful idea…In
a minute’s time, Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy
would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins…If Harry
could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the
journey left…Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of
the scenery flashing by the windows…but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry’s suspicions
seriously, so it was down to him to prove them.
“I’ll see you two later,” said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and
flinging it over himself.
“But what’re you —?” asked Neville.
“Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the
train made such caution almost pointless.
The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their
carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as
he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the
compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily
stuck out his foot to prevent it closing.
“What’s wrong with this thing?” said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly
into Harry’s foot.
Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled
over sideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the
compartment, leapt onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage
rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them,
for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them;
indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped
upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini
collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy,
sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled
uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched
Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone
would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a
bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe’s comic directly below him.
“So, Zabini,” said Malfoy, “what did Slughorn want?”
“Just trying to make up to well-connected people,” said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle.
“Not that he managed to find many.”
This information did not seem to please Malfoy. “Who else had he invited?” he demanded.
“McLaggen from Gryffindor,” said Zabini.
“Oh yeah, his uncle’s big in the Ministry,” said Malfoy.
“— someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw…”
“Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pansy.
“— and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,” finished Zabini.
Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy’s hand aside.
“He invited Longbottom?”
“Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,” said Zabini indifferently.
“What’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?” Zabini shrugged.
“Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at ‘the Chosen One,’” sneered Malfoy, “but
that Weasley girl! What’s so special about her?”
“A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his
reaction. “Even you think she’s good-looking, don’t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are
to please!
“I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,” said Zabini
coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the
stroking of his hair.
“Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste. Maybe he’s going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was
a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn’t
heard I’m on the train, or —”
“I wouldn’t bank on an invitation,” said Zabini. “He asked me about Notts father when I first
arrived. They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he’d been caught at the Ministry
he didn’t look happy, and Nott didn’t get an invitation, did he? I don’t think Slughorn’s interested
in Death Eaters.”
Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh.
“Well, who cares what he’s interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some
stupid teacher.” Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. “I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year,
what’s it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?”
“What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?” said Pansy indignantly, ceasing
grooming Malfoy at once.
“Well, you never know,” said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. “I might have — er — moved
on to bigger and better things.”
Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry’s heart began to race. What would Ron and
Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no
inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of
curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking
dumbfounded.
“Do you mean — Him?”
Malfoy shrugged.
“Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don’t see it as that important
these days. I mean, think about it…When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many
O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone’s got? Of course he isn’t. It’ll be all about the kind of service he
received, the level of devotion he was shown.”
“And you think you’ll be able to do something for him?” asked Zabini scathingly. “Sixteen years
old and not even fully qualified yet?”
“I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to
do isn’t something that you need to be qualified for,” said Malfoy quietly.
Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing
down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring.
“I can see Hogwarts,” said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of
the blackened window. “We’d better get our robes on.”
Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he
swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and
Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.
Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered
hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head
still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his
relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the
others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak
round his neck.
Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his
things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite
emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open
and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini
followed.
“You go on,” Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though
hoping he would hold it. “I just want to check something.”
Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past,
descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the
blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk
and opened it again.
Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had
Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so
important to mend?
“Petrificus Totalus!”
Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in
slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at
Malfoy’s feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still
curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn’t move a muscle; he could only gaze
up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.
“I thought so,” he said jubilantly. “I heard Goyle’s trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something
white flash through the air after Zabini came back…”
His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry’s trainers.
“You didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I’ve got you here…”
And he stamped, hard, on Harry’s face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.
“That’s from my father. Now, let’s see…”
Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry’s immobilized body and threw it over him.
“I don’t reckon they’ll find you till the trains back in London,” he said quietly. “See you around,
Potter…or not.”
And taking care to tread on Harry’s fingers, Malfoy left the compartment.
CHAPTER EIGHT
SNAPE VICTORIOUS
Harry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood
from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor
beyond. His immediate thought was that someone would, surely check the compartments before the
train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into
the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would
walk in and step on him.
Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood
dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in…and
now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside;
he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.
Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at
Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few
times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.
He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some
wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand,
which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words “Accio Wand!” over and over again in his head,
but nothing happened.
He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot
of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it)
panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through
him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the
muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be
recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.
The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty
underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life.
The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it…
Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, “Wotcher, Harry.”
There was a flash of red light and Harry’s body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more
dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and
raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away.
“We’d better get out of here, quickly,” she said, as the train windows became obscured with
steam and they began to move out of the station. “Come on, we’ll jump.”
Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the
platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He
followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet
steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.
The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry
and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him
back the Invisibility Cloak.
“Who did it?”
“Draco Malfoy,” said Harry bitterly. “Thanks for…well…”
“No problem,” said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was
as mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. “I can
fix your nose if you stand still.”
Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the
matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude
to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes, “Episkey” said Tonks.
Harry’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt gingerly. It seemed to be
mended.
“Thanks a lot!”
“You’d better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school,” said Tonks, still
unsmiling. As Harry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery
four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.
“Was that a Patronus?” asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.
“Yes, I’m sending word to the castle that I’ve got you or they’ll worry. Come on, we’d better not
dawdle.”
They set off toward the lane that led to the school.
“How did you find me?”
“I noticed you hadn’t left the train and I knew you had that cloak. I thought you might be
hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I’d
check.”
“But what are you doing here, anyway?” Harry asked.
“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,” said Tonks.
“Is it just you who’s stationed up here, or —?”
“No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.”
“Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?”
“That’s right.”
They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry
looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a
little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and
much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He
reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about
Sirius to her, that it hadn’t been her fault at all, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He was far
from blaming her for Sirius’s death; it was no more her fault than anyone else’s (and much less than
his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through
the cold night in silence, Tonks’s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.
Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far
Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side
of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry and he was quite keen to
leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found
them chained shut.
“Alohomora!” he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.
“That won’t work on these,” said Tonks. “Dumbledore bewitched them himself.”
Harry looked around, “I could climb a wall,” he suggested.
“No, you couldn’t,” said Tonks flatly. “Anti-intruder jinxes on all of them. Security’s been
tightened a hundredfold this summer.”
“Well then,” said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, “I suppose I’ll just
have to sleep out here and wait for morning. “
“Someone’s coming down for you,” said Tonks, “Look.”
A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he
could even endure Filch’s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping
would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow
light was ten feet away from them, and had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen,
that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair
of Severus Snape.
“Well, well, well,” sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the
chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open. “Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you
have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.”
“I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my —” Harry began, but Snape cut across him.
“There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite — ah — safe in my hands.”
“I meant Hagrid to get the message,” said Tonks, frowning.
“Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead. And
incidentally,” said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, “I was interested to see your
new Patronus.”
He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again, so
that they slithered, clinking, back into place.
“I think you were better off with the old one,” said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable.
“The new one looks weak.”
As Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks’s
face. Then she was covered in darkness once more.
“Good night,” Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began the walk up to the school with
Snape. “Thanks for…everything,”
“See you, Harry.”
Snape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of
hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had
loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably
beyond the possibility of Harry’s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore
said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape’s snide remarks
to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting
Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that
he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt
satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man
now striding next to him in the darkness.
“Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,” said Snape. “And, let me see, another twenty
for your Muggle attire. You know, I don’t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this
early in the term: We haven’t even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.”
The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have
been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late.
“I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?” Snape continued. “And with no flying car
available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a
dramatic effect.”
Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode. He knew that Snape had
come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without
anyone else listening.
They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast
flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them
through the doors standing open into the Great Hail. Harry wondered whether he could slip his
Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which,
inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had
read Harry’s mind, however, Snape said, “No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you,
which is what you wanted, I’m sure.”
Harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away
from Snape. The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the
room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was
all a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table
before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him,
he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in
between them.
“Where’ve you — blimey, what’ve you done to your face?” said Ron, goggling at him along with
everyone else in the vicinity.
“Why, what’s wrong with it?” said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted
reflection.
“You’re covered in blood!” said Hermione. “Come here —”
She raised her wand, said “Tergeo!” and siphoned off the dried blood.
“Thanks,” said Harry, feeling his now clean face. “How’s my nose looking?
“Normal,” said Hermoine anxiously. “Why shouldn’t it? Harry, what happened? We’ve been
terrified!”
“I’ll tell you later,” said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and
Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along
the bench to eavesdrop.
“But —” said Hermione.
“Not now, Hermione,” said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they
would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death
Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could, but there was
always a chance it wouldn’t reach too many Gryffindor ears.
He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips, but before he could
take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.
“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said Hermione, as Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau.
“Hat say anything interesting?” asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.
“More of the same, really…advising us all to unite in the face enemies, you know.”
“Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?”
“Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast doesn’t he? It can’t be long
now.”
“Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast —”
“You’ve seen Snape? How come?” said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.
“Bumped into him,” said Harry evasively.
“Hagrid was only a few minutes late,” said Hermione. “Look, he’s waving at you, Harry.”
Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid
had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of
Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid’s elbow and
shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic
greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid’s
other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before.
She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous
size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to
discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that
caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry’s parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge made him
even less eager to find himself in her company, thankfully, this year he would be dropping
Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the
Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and
applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would give to
fight Malfoy one-on-one…
“So what did Professor Slughorn want?” Hermione asked.
“To know what really happened at the Ministry.” said Harry.
“Him and everyone else here,” sniffed Hermione. “People were interrogating us about it on the
train, weren’t they, Ron?”
“Yeah,” said Ron. “All wanting to know if you really are ‘the Chosen One’ —”
“There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,” interrupted Nearly
Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on
its ruff. “I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I
have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. ‘Harry Potter
knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,’ I told them. ‘I would rather die than
betray his trust.’”
“That’s not saying much, seeing as you’re already dead,” Ron observed.
“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted
tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as
Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died
away almost instantly.
“The very best of evenings to you!” he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to
embrace the whole room.
“What happened to his hand?” gasped Hermione.
She was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore’s right hand was as blackened and
dead-looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers it
the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold
sleeve over his injury.
“Nothing to worry about,” he said airily. “Now…to our new students, welcome, to our old
students, welcome back! Another year full of magical education awaits you…”
“His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I
thought he’d have cured it by now, though…or Madam Pomfrey would’ve done.”
“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. “But there are some injuries
you can’t cure…old curses…and there are poisons without antidotes…”
“…and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke
items bought at the shop called Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.
“Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads
of House as usual. We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year, Professor Slughorn”— Slughorn
stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table into
shadow — “is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.”
“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered wheel they had heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare Harry. “But you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising voice so that it carried over all the
muttering, “will be taking the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He did not care; he was
staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts
job after all this time? Hadn’t it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to
do it?
“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!”
said Hermione.
“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him
this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what
Slughorn would be teaching.
Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did not stand up his mention of his name; he
merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was
sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.
“Well, there’s one good thing,” he said savagely. “Snape’ll be gone by the end of the year.”
“What do you mean?” asked Ron.
“That job’s jinxed. No ones lasted more than a year…Quirrell actually died doing
it…Personally, I’m going to keep my fingers crossed for another death…”
“Harry!” said Hermione, shocked and reproachful.
“He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,” said Ron reasonably. “That
Slughorn bloke might not want to stay long-term. Moody didn’t.”
Dumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the only ones who had
been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally
achieved his heart’s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just
imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to
ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.
“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large
and gaining in strength.”
The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy
was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he
found the headmaster’s words unworthy of his attention.
“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care
each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The castle’s magical fortifications
have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we
must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I
urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you,
however irksome you might find them — in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of after
hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle,
to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the
utmost regard for your own and others’ safety.”
Dumbledore’s blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more.
“But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know
that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night.
Pip pip!”
With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches moved back and the hundreds of students
began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. Harry, who was in no hurry at all to
leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of
the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of
Gryffindors to draw ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect’s duty of
shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Harry.
“What really happened to your nose?” he asked, once they were at the very back of the throng
pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else.
Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh.
“I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,” he said darkly.
“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry bitterly. “Listen to what he was saying before he found
out I was there…”
Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoys boasts. With what Harry considered pure
pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.
“Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinson…What kind of mission would You-
Know-Who have given him?”
“How d’you know Voldemort doesn’t need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldn’t be the first -”
“I wish yeh’d stop sayin’ tha name, Harry,” said a reproachful voice behind them. Harry looked
over his shoulder to see Hagrid shaking his head.
“Dumbledore uses that name,” said Harry stubbornly
“Yeah, well, tha’s Dumbledore, innit?” said Hagrid mysteriously. “So how come yeh were late,
Harry? I was worried.”
“Got held up on the train,” said Harry. “Why were you late?”
“I was with Grawp,” said Hagrid happily. “Los’ track o’ the time. He’s got a new home up in the
mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it — nice big cave. He’s much happier than he was in the forest.
We were havin’ a good chat.”
“Really?” said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron’s eye; the last time he had met Hagrid’s half-
brother, a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised
five words, two of which he was unable to pronounce properly.
“Oh yeah, he’s really come on,” said Hagrid proudly. “Yeh’ll be amazed. I’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’
him up as me assistant.”
Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze. They were now standing
beside the oak front doors.
“Anyway, I’ll see yeh tomorrow, firs’ lesson’s straight after lunch. Come early an’ yeh can say
hello ter Buck — I mean, Witherwings!”
Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the doors into the darkness.
Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell that Ron was experiencing the same
sinking feeling as himself.
“You’re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?”
Ron shook his head. “And you’re not either, are you?”
Harry shook his head too.
“And Hermione,” said Ron, “she’s not, is she?”
Harry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite
students had given up his subject, he did not like to think.
CHAPTER NINE
THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for
some support in his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy
saying on the Hogwarts Express.
“But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn’t he?” interjected Ron quickly, before
Hermione could say anything.
“Well,” she said uncertainly, “I don’t know…It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem
more important than he is…but that’s a big lie to tell…”
“Exactly,” said Harry, but he could not press the point, because so many people were trying to
listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands.
“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the
queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry
behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron
sniggered. “I love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods
when we can just sit up here and relax.”
“We’re going to need that time for studying, Ron!” said Hermione, as they set off down the
corridor.
“Yeah, but not today,” said Ron. “Today’s going to be a real loss, I reckon.”
“Hold it!” said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was
attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. “Fanged Frisbees
banned, hand it over,” she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee,
ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the
Frisbee from Hermione’s grip.
“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.”
Hermione’s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found
Ron’s remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over
her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.
The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the
squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and
eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid
the previous evening.
“But he can’t really think we’d continue Care of Magical Creatures!” she said, looking distressed.
“I mean, when has any of us expressed…you know…any enthusiasm?”
“That’s it, though, innit?” said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. “We were the ones
who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid
subject. D’ya reckon anyone’s going to go on to N.E.W.T.?”
Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that
nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid’s eye
and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.
After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall’s descent
from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year,
for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L.
grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.
Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts,
Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period
Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was
anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L results.
“Herbology, fine,” she said. “Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an
‘Outstanding’ O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with ‘Exceeds
Expectations.’ But the problem is Transfiguration. I’m sorry, Longbottom, but an ‘Acceptable’ really
isn’t good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. Just don’t think you’d be able to cope with the
coursework.”
Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles.
“Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I’ve never had the impression that
you particularly enjoyed it.”
Neville looked miserable and muttered something about “my grandmother wants.”
“Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall. “It’s high time your grandmother learned to be proud
of the grandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what
happened at the Ministry.”
Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a
compliment before.
“I’m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an
‘Exceeds Expectations’ in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?”
“My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,” mumbled Neville.
“Take Charms,” said Professor McGonagall, “and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that
just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.” Smiling slightly
at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville’s face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule
with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville.
Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the
handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination.
“He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,” said Professor
McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the
subject of Divination. “The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.”
Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.
“So, Potter, Potter…” said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry.
“Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration…all fine. I must say, I was
pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven’t you applied to
continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?”
“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L., Professor.”
“And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is
perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to
proceed with Potions?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn’t buy the books or any ingredients or anything-”
“I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,” said Professor McGonagall. “Very
well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their
names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix
up trials at your leisure.”
A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left
the table together.
“Look,” said Ron delightedly, gazing ar his schedule, “we’ve got a free period now…and a free
period after break…and after lunch…excellent.”
They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years,
including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that
Harry had joined in his first year.
“I thought you’d get that, well done,” she called over, pointing at the Captains badge on Harry’s
chest. “Tell me when you call trials!”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, “you don’t need to try out, I watched you play for five years…”
“You mustn’t start off like that,” she said warningly. “For all you know, there’s someone much
better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept
playing the old faces, or letting in their friends…”
Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had
taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting
to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks’s yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too
close.
An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark
Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of
heavy books and looking put-upon.
“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. “A
fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I’ve got to read these by Wednesday!”
“Shame,” yawned Ron.
“You wait,” she said resentfully. “I bet Snape gives us loads.”
The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face
framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.
“Inside,” he said.
Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already;
it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight.
New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting
grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around
at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.
“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said Snape, closing the door and moving to face
the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back
into her bag and stowed it under her chair. “I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest
attention.”
His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on
Harry’s than anyone else’s.
“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.”
You believe…like you haven’t watched them all come and go, hoping you’d be next, thought
Harry scathingly.
“Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this
confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more
surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.”
Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their
necks to keep him in view. “The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, varied, ever-changing, and
eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed,
sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed,
mutating, indestructible.”
Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy,
another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?
“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the
arts you seek to undo. These pictures” - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - “give a fair
representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse” - he waved a
hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - “feel the Dementor’s Kiss” - a wizard lying
huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall - “or provoke the aggression of the Inferius” - a
bloody mass upon ground.
“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. “Is it definite, is he
using them?”
“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said Snape, “which means you would be well-
advised to assume he might use them again. Now…”
He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched
him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him.,
“…you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a
nonverbal spell?”
Hermione’s hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else,
making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very well - Miss Granger?”
“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re about to perform,” said
Hermione, “which gives you a split-second advantage.”
“An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,” said
Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), “but correct in essentials. Yes, those who
progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-
casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power
which some” - his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - “lack.”
Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He
refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away.
“You will now divide,” Snape went on, “into pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other
without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.”
Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been
a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever
cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people
were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the
lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville’s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word,
a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher,
thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as they practiced, looking
just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the
task.
Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed
to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised,
waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.
“Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. “Here — let me show you —”
He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal
spells forgotten, he yelled, “Protego!”
His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class
had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.
“Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry stiffly.
“Yes, sir.”
“There’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ Professor.” The words had escaped him before he knew what he
was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and
Seamus grinned appreciatively.
“Detention, Saturday night, my office,” said Snape. “I do not take cheek from anyone,
Potter…not even ‘the Chosen One.’“
“That was brilliant, Harry!” chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short
while later.
“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, frowning at Ron. “What made you?”
“He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed Harry. “I had enough of that during
those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn’t he use another guinea pig for a change? What’s
Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the
Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructble stuff —”
“Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit like you.”
“Like me?”
“Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn’t just
memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn’t
that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?”
Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The
Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue.
“Harry! Hey, Harry!”
Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team,
was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.
“For you,” panted Sloper. “Listen, I heard you’re the new Captain. When’re you holding trials?”
“I’m not sure yet,” said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on
the team. “I’ll let you know.”
“Oh, right. I was hoping it’d be this weekend —”
But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment.
Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment
as he went.
Dear Harry,
I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope
you are enjoying your first day back at school.
Yours sincerely,
Albus Dumbledore
P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.
“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the message over Harry’s shoulder and was
looking perplexed.
“It’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,” said Harry in a low voice. “Ha!
Snape’s not going to be pleased…I won’t be able to do his detention!”
He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach
Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters
would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that
Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to
Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started
Snape’s homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when
Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the
process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon’s double Potions and they
beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape’s.
When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to
N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but
four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one
Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.
“Harry,” Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, “didn’t get a
chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield
Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags…And how are you, Ron — Hermione?”
Before they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon door opened and Slughorn’s belly preceded
him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his
beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.
The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a
table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with
Ernie. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most
seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart,
the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled
at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion’s fumes
seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at
Ron, who grinned back lazily.
“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through
the many shimmering vapors. “Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don’t forget your copies of
Advanced Potion-Making…”
“Sir?” said Harry, raising his hand.
“Harry, m’boy?”
“I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s Ron — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do
the N.E.W.T., you see —”
“Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention…not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all.
You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I’m sure we can lend you some scales,
and we’ve got a small stock of old books here, they’ll do until you can write to Flourish and
Blotts…” Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment’s foraging, emerged with
two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to
Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.
“Now then,” said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging
chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, “I’ve prepared a few potions for
you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be
able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ‘em, even if you haven’t
made ‘em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?”
He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and
saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.
Hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s; Slughorn pointed at her.
“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth,” said
Hermione.
“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he continued, pointing at the cauldron
nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty well known…Featured in a few Ministry leaflets
lately too…Who can —?”
Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
“lt’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did
not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who
had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. “Excellent, excellent! Now, this one
here…yes, my dear?” said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione’s hand punched
the air again.
“It’s Amortentia!”
“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said Slughorn, who was looking mightily
impressed, “but I assume you know what it does?”
“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said Hermione.
“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?”
“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione enthusiastically, “and it’s
supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown
grass and new parchment and-”
But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.
“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione’s embarrassment.
“Hermione Granger, sir.”
“Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the
Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?”
“No. I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see.”
Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but
Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who
was sitting next to her.
“Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our year!’ I’m assuming this
is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,” said Slughorn
genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face.
Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the
best in the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed.
“You are the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was
saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
“Amortentia doesn’t really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love.
No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and
powerful potion in this room — oh yes,” he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of
whom were smirking skeptically. “When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not
underestimate the power of obsessive love.”
“And now,” said Slughorn, “it is time for us to start work.”
“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black
cauldron standing on Slughorn’s desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the
color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a
particle had spilled.
“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all,
but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. “Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a
most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione,
who had let out an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the
back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,”
said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed
correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed…at least until the
effects wear off.”
“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said Terry Boot eagerly.
“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,” said
Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you know…highly toxic in large quantities. But taken
sparingly, and very occasionally…”
“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great interest.
“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven.
Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.” He gazed dreamily into the distance.
Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good.
“And that,” said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, “is what I shall be offering as a prize
in this lesson.”
There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed
magnified tenfold.
“One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it
out of his pocket and showing it to them all. “Enough for twelve hours’ luck. From dawn till dusk,
you will be lucky in everything you attempt.”
“Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized
competitions…sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on
an ordinary day only…and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!”
“So,” said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, “how are you to win this fabulous prize? Well, by turning to
page ten of Advanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time
for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than
anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person
who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!”
There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as
people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room
was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-
Making. It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly
over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.
To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the
margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here,
the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store
cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up
Valerian roots as fast as he could.
Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an
advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten
minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed
furthest. Her potion already resembled the “smooth, black currant-colored liquid” mentioned as the
ideal halfway stage.
Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very
irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous
owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had
written in the alternative instruction:
Crush with flat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting.
“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?” Harry looked up; Slughorn was just
passing the Slytherin table.
“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, “I was sorry to hear he had died, although of
course it wasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at his age…”
And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy
had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment
of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on
nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis.
The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione.
“Can I borrow your silver knife?”
She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though
according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.
Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately
exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all.
Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately
turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.
His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next
line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned
clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a
clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?
Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was
immediate. The potion turned pale pink.
“How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing
bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.
“Add a clockwise stir —”
“No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she snapped.
Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise,
pause…seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise…
Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice.
Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else’s potion had turned as pale as his. He felt
elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.
“And time’s…up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, please!”
Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but
occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron,
Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron’s cauldron. He
passed over Ernie’s navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw
Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it’s clear
you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then,
here you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!”
Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination
of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on
Hermione’s. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.
“How did you do that?” he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon.
“Got lucky, I suppose,” said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot.
Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe
enough to tell them. Hermione’s face became stonier with every word he uttered.
“I s’pose you think I cheated?” he finished, aggravated by her expression.
“Well, it wasn’t exactly your own work, was it?” she said stiffly.
“He only followed different instructions to ours,” said Ron, “Could’ve been a catastrophe,
couldn’t it? But he took a risk and it paid off.” He heaved a sigh. “Slughorn could’ve handed me that
book, but no, I get the one no one’s ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but—”
“Hang on,” said a voice close by Harry’s left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery
smell he had picked up in Slughorn’s dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined
them. “Did I hear right? You’ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book,
Harry?”
She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once.
“It’s nothing,” he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. “It’s not like, you know, Riddle’s diary.
It’s just an old textbook someone’s scribbled on.”
“But you’re doing what it says?”
“I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there’s nothing funny-”
“Ginny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at once. “We ought to check that there’s
nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?”
“Hey!” said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag
and raised her wand. “Specialis Revelio!” she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing
whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared.
“Finished?” said Harry irritably. “Or d’you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?”
“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. “I mean, it really does
seem to be…just a textbook.”
“Good. Then I’ll have it back,” said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his
hand and landed open on the floor.
Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw
something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as
the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks
in his trunk upstairs.
This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince.
CHAPTER TEN
THE HOUR OF GAUNT
For or the rest of the week’s Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince’s
instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson
Slughorn was raving about Harry’s abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented.
Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book
with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could
not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was
resolutely plowing on with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-
tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of
homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced
Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which
the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and
there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in
the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks
more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”
“The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The
Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into
his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait up, we want to hear
what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait
hole.
Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when
Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-
looking playing cards, reading them as she walked.
“Two of spades: conflict,” she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden.
“Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly
troubled, one who dislikes the questioner —”
She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry’s statue.
“Well, that can’t be right,” she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she
set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was
quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor
where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.
“Acid Pops,” said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving
spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles
up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore’s Office.
Harry knocked.
“Come in,” said Dumbledore s voice.
“Good evening, sir,” said Harry, walking into the headmaster’s office.
“Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I hope you’ve had an
enjoyable first week back at school?”
“Yes, thanks, sir,” said Harry.
“You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!”
“Er,” began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern.
“I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.”
“Right,” said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and
now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do
with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments
stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and
headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his
perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though
Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.
“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. “You have been wondering, I am sure,
what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try
and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.” There was a pause.
“You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,” said Harry. It was hard
to keep a note of accusation from his voice. “Sir,” he added.
“And so I did,” said Dumbledore placidly. “I told you everything I know. From this point forth,
we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes
of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong
as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.”
“But you think you’re right?” said Harry.
“Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact,
being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly
huger.”
“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “does what you’re going to tell me have anything to do with the
prophecy? Will it help me…survive?”
“It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had
asked him about the next days weather, “and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.”
Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his
seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore
straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its
rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry.
“You look worried.”
Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences
with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had
also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than
he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling.
“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me…and, even more unusually, with permission.”
“Where are we going, sir?”
“For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a
crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery-white substance.
“Who was Bob Ogden?”
“He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” said Dumbledore. “He
died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these
recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If
you will stand, Harry…”
But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured
hand seemed stiff and painful.
“Shall — shall I, sir?”
“No matter, Harry —”
Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out.
“Sir — how did you injure your hand?” Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with
a mixture of revulsion and pity.
“Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob
Ogden.”
Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and
shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. “After you,” said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl. Harry
bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet
leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-denly, he
was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.
They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer
sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man
wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden
signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this
must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of
clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock
coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than
register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.
Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two
arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm
pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile.
They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and
the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping
steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in
front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep
hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a
handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.
Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore
lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their
final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had
to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they
were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner,
it was to see the very edge of Ogden’s frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.
Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder
hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping
down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them.
Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt
behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.
Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few
seconds before Harry’s eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It
seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees
growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was
inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible
in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with
grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows
was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though
somebody was cooking.
Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of
the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a
dead snake.
Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on
his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat
and stumbled.
“You’re not welcome.”
The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color.
Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He
might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Harry could not blame
Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke.
“Er — good morning. I’m from the Ministry of Magic —”
“You’re not welcome.”
“Er — I’m sorry — I don’t understand you,” said Ogden nervously.
Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in
Harry’s opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather
bloody knife in the other.
“You understand him, I’m sure, Harry?” said Dumbledore quietly.
“Yes, of course,” said Harry, slightly nonplussed. “Why can’t Ogden —?”
But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood.
“He’s speaking Parseltongue?”
“Very good,” said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling.
The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other.
“Now, look —” Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground,
clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.
“Morfin!” said a loud voice.
An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the
dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his
shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby
hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the
man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground.
“Ministry, is it?” said the older man, looking down at Ogden.
“Correct!” said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. “And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?”
“S’right,” said Gaunt. “Got you in the face, did he?”
“Yes, he did!” snapped Ogden.
“Should’ve made your presence known, shouldn’t you?” said Gaunt aggressively. “This is private
property. Can’t just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.”
“Defend himself against what, man?” said Ogden, clambering back to his feet.
“Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.” Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was
still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt
spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin.
“Get in the house. Don’t argue.”
This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was
being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to
be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind,
lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so
that the snake swung sadly again.
“It’s your son I’m here to see, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from
the front of his coat. “That was Morfin, wasn’t it?”
“Ah, that was Morfin,” said the old man indifferently. “Are you pure-blood?” he asked, suddenly
aggressive.
“That’s neither here nor there,” said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise.
Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden’s face and muttered, in what was
clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, “Now I come to think about it, I’ve seen noses like yours
down in the village.”
“I don’t doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,” said Ogden. “Perhaps we could continue
this discussion inside?”
“Inside?”
“Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I’ve already told you. I’m here about Morfin. We sent an owl —”
“I’ve no use for owls,” said Gaunt. “I don’t open letters.”
“Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,” said Ogden tartly. “I am
here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this
morning —”
“All right, all right, all right!” bellowed Gaunt. “Come in the bleeding house, then, and much
good it’ll do you!”
The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served
as kitchen and living room com-bined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking
fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue:
Hissy, hissy, little snakey,
Slither on the floor
You be good to Morfin
Or he’ll nail you to the door.
There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there
was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone
wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling
around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she
had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother’s, stared in opposite directions. She
looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-
looking person.
“M’daughter, Merope,” said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her.
“Good morning,” said Ogden.
She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and
continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her.
“Well, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, “to get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your
son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.”
There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots.
“Pick it up!” Gaunt bellowed at her. “That’s it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what’s
your wand for, you useless sack of muck?”
“Mr. Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the
pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket,
pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the
floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.
Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, “Mend it, you pointless lump, mend
it!”
Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted
his own and said firmly, “Reparo.” The pot mended itself instantly.
Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think
better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, “Lucky the nice man from the Ministry’s here, isn’t it?
Perhaps he’ll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn’t mind dirty Squibs…”
Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it,
hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy
window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and
vanish.
“Mr. Gaunt,” Ogden began again, “as I’ve said: the reason for my visit —”
“I heard you the first time!” snapped Gaunt. “And so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what
was coming to him — what about it, then?”
“Morfin has broken Wizarding law,” said Ogden sternly.
“‘Morfin has broken Wizarding law.’“ Gaunt imitated Ogden’s voice, making it pompous and
singsong. Morfin cackled again. “He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that’s illegal now, is it?”
“Yes,” said Ogden. “I’m afraid it is.”
He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it.
“What’s that, then, his sentence?” said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily.
“It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing —”
“Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?”
“I’m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,” said Ogden.
“And you think we’re scum, do you?” screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty
yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. “Scum who’ll come running when the Ministry tells ‘em
to? Do you know who you’re talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?”
“I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, looking wary, but
standing his ground.
“That’s right!” roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand
gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on
his middle finger, waving it before Ogden’s eyes. “See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it
came from? Centuries it’s been in our family, that’s how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way!
Know how much I’ve been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?”
“I’ve really no idea,” said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, “and it’s
quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed —”
With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was
going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward
Ogden by a gold chain around her neck.
“See this?” he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered
and gasped for breath.
“I see it, I see it!” said Ogden hastily.
“Slytherins!” yelled Gaunt. “Salazar Slytherin’s! We’re his last living descendants, what do you
say to that, eh?”
“Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!” said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she
staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air.
“So!” said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all
possible dispute. “Don’t you go talking to us as if we’re dirt on your shoes! Generations of pure-
bloods, wizards all — more than you can say, I don’t doubt!”
And he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the
window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing.
“Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden doggedly, “I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have
anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he
accosted late last night. Our information”— he glanced down at his scroll of parchment — “is that
Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.”
Morfin giggled.
“Be quiet, boy,” snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again.
“And so what if he did, then?” Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden, “I expect you’ve wiped the
Muggle’s filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot —”
“That’s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?” said Ogden. “This was an unprovoked attack on a
defenseless —”
“Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,” sneered Gaunt, and he
spat on the floor again.
“This discussion is getting us nowhere,” said Ogden firmly. “It is clear from your son’s attitude
that he feels no remorse for his actions.” He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. “Morfin
will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of
a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg —”
Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting
in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the
copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face
toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly
white.
“My God, what an eyesore!” rang out a girl’s voice, as clearly audible through the open window
as if she had stood in the room beside them. “Couldn’t your father have that hovel cleared away,
Tom?”
“It’s not ours,” said a young man’s voice. “Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to
us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son’s quite mad,
you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village —”
The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to
get out of his armchair.
“Keep your seat,” said his father warningly, in Parseltongue.
“Tom,” said the girl’s voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house,
“I might be wrong — but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?”
“Good lord, you’re right!” said the man’s voice. “That’ll be the son, I told you he’s not right in
the head. Don’t look at it, Cecilia, darling.”
The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again.
“‘Darling,’” whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. “‘Darling, he called her. So he
wouldn’t have you anyway.”
Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint.
“What’s that?” said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter.
“What did you say, Morfin?”
“She likes looking at that Muggle,” said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his
sister, who now looked terrified. “Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at
him, isn’t she? And last night —”
Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the
window waiting for him to ride home, wasn’t she?”
“Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said Gaunt quietly.
All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and
irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping.
“Is it true?” said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. “My
daughter — pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin — hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined
Muggle?”
Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak.
“But I got him, Father!” cackled Morfin. “I got him as he went by and he didn’t look so pretty with
hives all over him, did he, Merope?”
“You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!” roared Gaunt, losing control, and his
hands closed around his daughter’s throat.
Both Harry and Ogden yelled “No!” at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried,
“Relashio!”
Gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his
back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody
knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand.
Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed,
Merope’s screams echoing in his ears.
Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he
collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he
and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who
bounced off the horse’s flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in
dust, running pell-mell up the lane.
“I think that will do, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next
moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their
feet, back in Dumbledore’s now twilit office.
“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps
with a flick of his wand. “Merope, or whatever her name was?”
“Oh, she survived,” said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that
Harry should sit down too. “Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with
reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were
overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin,
who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who
had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.”
“Marvolo?” Harry repeated wonderingly.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. “I am glad to see you’re keeping up.”
“That old man was —?”
“Voldemort’s grandfather, yes,” said Dumbledore. “Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter,
Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability
and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own
cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was
squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and
poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family
heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.”
“So Merope,” said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and star-ing at Dumbledore, “so Merope
was…Sir, does that mean she was…Voldemort’s mother?”
“It does,” said Dumbledore. “And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s
father. I wonder whether you noticed?”
“The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?”
“Very good indeed,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the
handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt
cherished a secret, burning passion.”
“And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to
fall in love.
“I think you are forgetting,” said Dumbledore, “that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that
her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father.
Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in
her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the
desperate life she had led for eighteen years.
“Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his
Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?”
“The Imperius Curse?” Harry suggested. “Or a love potion?”
“Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would
have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot
day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a
few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a
tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire’s son ran off with the
tramp’s daughter, Merope.
“But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find
his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a
clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.
“From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that
time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had
simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to
see Morfin return to the cottage.”
“And Merope? She…she died, didn’t she? Wasn’t Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?”
“Yes, indeed,” said Dumbledore. “We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do
not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway
marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The
rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’
What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I
daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard
what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending
that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.”
“But she did have his baby.”
“But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.”
“What went wrong?” asked Harry. “Why did the love potion stop working?”
“Again, this is guesswork,” said Dumbledore, “but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love
with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she
made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced
herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would
stay for the baby’s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and
never troubled to discover what became of his son.”
The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore’s office seemed to glow more
brightly than before.
“I think that will do for tonight, Harry,” said Dumbledore after a moment or two.
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
He got to his feet, but did not leave.
“Sir…is it important to know all this about Voldemort’s past?”
“Very important, I think,” said Dumbledore.
“And it…it’s got something to do with the prophecy?”
“It has everything to do with the prophecy.”
“Right,” said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same.
He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. “Sir, am I
allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you’ve told me?”
Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, “Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss
Granger have proved themselves trust-worthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to
repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I
know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort’s secrets.”
“No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione. Good night.”
He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little
spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring
set with a large, cracked, black stone.
“Sir,” said Harry, staring at it. “That ring —”
“Yes?” said Dumbledore.
“You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.”
“So I was,” Dumbledore agreed.
“But isn’t it…sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?”
Dumbledore bowed his head. “The very same.”
“But how come —? Have you always had it?”
“No, I acquired it very recently,” said Dumbledore. “A few days before I came to fetch you from
your aunt and uncle’s, in fact.”
“That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?”
“Around that time, yes, Harry.”
Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling.
“Sir, how exactly —?”
“Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night.”
“Good night, sir.”
CHAPTER ELEVEN
HERMIONE’S HELPING HAND
As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years’ free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation
Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework
they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the
lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of
what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat
instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment, Harry’s best subject
had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms
and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at
mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo;
but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud.
It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than
ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula
seized them unexpectedly from behind.
One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was
that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had
stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had
passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear
their greetings.
“We’ve got to go and explain,” said Hermione, looking up at Hagrid’s huge empty chair at the
staff table the following Saturday at breakfast.
“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron. “And we’re supposed to be practicing
that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we
hated his stupid subject?”
“We didn’t hate it!” said Hermione.
“Speak for yourself, I haven’t forgotten the skrewts,” said Ron darkly. “And I’m telling you now,
we’ve had a narrow escape. You didn’t hear him going on about his gormless brother — we’d have
been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.”
“I hate not talking to Hagrid,” said Hermione, looking upset.
“We’ll go down after Quidditch,” Harry assured her. He too was missing Hagrid, although like
Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives. “But trials might take all
morning, the number of people who have applied.” He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first
hurdle of his Captaincy. “I dunno why the team’s this popular all of a sudden.”
“Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It’s not Quidditch that’s popular,
it’s you! You’ve never been more interesting, and frankly, you’ve never been more fanciable.”
Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning
back to Harry.
“Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, don’t they? The whole Wizarding world has
had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him
twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they’re calling you ‘the Chosen One’ —
well, come on, can’t you see why people are fascinated by you?”
Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked
cold and rainy.
“And you’ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make
out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil
woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway…”
“You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,” said Ron, shaking
back his sleeves.
“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the summer either,” Hermione
finished, ignoring Ron.
“I’m tall,” said Ron inconsequentially.
The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone with
droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to
hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received
no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had
hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised,
therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed
in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in
front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon.
“Ha!” said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh
from Flourish and Blotts.
“Oh good,” said Hermione, delighted. “Now you can give that graffitied copy back.”
“Are you mad?” said Harry. “I’m keeping it! Look, I’ve thought it out —”
He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his
wand, muttering, “Diffindo!” The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book
(Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, “Reparo!”
There sat the Prince’s copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish
and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand.
“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can’t complain, it cost nine Galleons.”
Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a
third owl landing in front of her carrying that day’s copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily
and scanned the front page.
“Anyone we know dead?” asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question
every time Hermione opened her paper.
“No, but there have been more dementor attacks,” said Hermione. “And an arrest.”
“Excellent, who?” said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange.
“Stan Shunpike,” said Hermione.
“What?” said Harry, startled.
“‘Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been
arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night
after a raid on his Clapham home…’”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met
three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably. “You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here he was arrested after
he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret plans in a pub.” She looked up with a
troubled expression on her face. “If he was under the Imperius Curse, he’d hardly stand around
gossiping about their plans, would he?”
“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,” said Ron. “Isn’t he the
one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those
veela?”
“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re playing at, taking Stan seriously.”
“They probably want to look as though they’re doing something,” said Hermione, frowning.
“People are terrified — you know the Patil twins’ parents want them to go home? And Eloise
Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.”
“What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be!
We’ve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we’ve got Dumbledore!”
“I don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff
table over the top of the Prophet. “Haven’t you noticed? His seat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s
this past week.”
Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster’s chair was indeed empty. Now
Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.
“I think he’s left the school to do something with the Order,” said Hermione in a low voice. “I
mean…it’s all looking serious, isn’t it?”
Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing.
There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of
Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.
When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they
passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil
twins’ parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best
friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew
level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile.
Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more
like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing
so after Malfoy had broken Harry’s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way
down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands
without wishing Ron good luck.
As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to
have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school
brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included
a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.
“We met on the train, in old Sluggy’s compartment,” he said confidently, stepping out of the
crowd to shake Harry’s hand. “Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.”
“You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen
and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.
“I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,” said McLaggen, with something of a
swagger. “Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.”
“Right,” said Harry. “Well…if you wait over there…”
He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was sitting. He thought he
saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen’s face and wondered whether McLaggen expected
preferential treatment because they were both “old Sluggy’s” favorites.
Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of
ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years,
and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to
remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one
of the goal posts.
The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who,
when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was
amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in
the stands to heckle everyone else.
The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come
without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs.
“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from Gryffindor,” roared Harry, who was starting to get
seriously annoyed, “leave now, please!
There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with
laughter.
After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two
Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the
team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at
dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen
goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices,
Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar
battle with the rejected Beaters.
“That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of the way of the Keepers I’ll hex you,” he
bellowed.
Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still
reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had
managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry’s head with a ferociously hit
Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza,
and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.
Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and
less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of
people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that
it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in
equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had
hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a
delicate shade of green.
None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harry’s great
disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he
shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to
the ground grinding his teeth.
Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. “Good luck!” cried a voice
from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He
would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought
that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.
Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted,
and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell
him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen’s red face inches from
his own. He stepped back hastily.
“His sister didn’t really try,” said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple
like the one Harry had often ad-mired in Uncle Vernon’s. “She gave him an easy save.”
“Rubbish,” said Harry coldly. “That was the one he nearly missed.”
McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time.
“Give me another go.”
“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it
fair and square. Get out of my way.”
He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an
ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air.
Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.
“Well done,” he croaked. “You flew really well —”
“You did brilliantly, Ron!”
This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender
walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked
extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at
Hermione.
After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrid’s. A watery sun was
trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely
hungry; he hoped there would be some-thing to eat at Hagrid’s.
“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” Ron was saying happily. “Tricky shot from
Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it —”
“Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, looking amused.
“I was better than that McLaggen anyway,” said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. “Did you see
him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like he’d been Confunded…”
To Harry’s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed
nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail.
The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid’s cabin. He clicked his
razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them.
“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit scary, isn’t he?”
“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron. Harry stepped forward and bowed low
to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into
a bow too.
“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head.
“Missing him? But you’re okay here with Hagrid, aren’t you?”
“Oi!” said a loud voice.
Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and
carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming
bark and bounded forward.
“Git away from him! He’ll have yer fingers — oh. It’s yeh lot.”
Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and
looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door
behind him.
“Oh dear!” said Hermione, looking stricken.
“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly.
“Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!”
There was no sound from within.
“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry said, pulling out his wand.
“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t possibly —”
“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back —”
But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would,
and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively
alarming.
“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down
my door!”
“I’m sorry, sir” said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes.
Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?”
“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?”
“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. That’s me outsmarted, innit? All righ’, come
in then, yeh ungrateful little…”
Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking
rather frightened.
“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down around his enormous
wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry’s knee and drooling all over his robes.
“What’s this? Feelin’ sorry for me? Reckon I’m lonely or summat?”
“No,” said Harry at once. “We wanted to see you.”
“We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously.
“Missed me, have yeh?” snorted Hagrid. “Yeah. Righ’.”
He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while.
Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a
plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid’s cooking, and took one at once.
“Hagrid,” said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his
potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, “we
really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.” Hagrid gave another great
snort. Harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that
they were not staying for dinner.
“We did!” said Hermione. “But none of us could fit it into our schedules!”
“Yeah. Righ’,” said Hagrid again.
There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek,
and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the
corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots, slimy,
white, and writhing.
“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but
putting down his rock cake all the same.
“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.
“And they grow into…?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.
“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ‘em ter feed ter Aragog.”
And without warning, he burst into tears.
“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the
barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. “What is it?”
“It’s…him…” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes stream-ing as he mopped his face with his
apron. “It’s…Aragog…I think he’s dyin’…He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better…I
don’ know what I’ll do if he…if he…We’ve bin tergether so long…”
Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew
how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him
croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a
half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic
talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only
narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s frantic grimaces and
head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears.
“See, the rest o’ the tribe…Aragog’s family…they’re gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill…bit restive…”
“Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said Ron in an undertone.
“…I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo’,” Hagrid
finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. “But thanks fer offerin’, Hermione…It
means a lot.”
After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had
shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed
to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.
“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,” he said gruffly,
pouring them more tea. “Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners —”
“We couldn’t have done,” said Hermione. “We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-
Turners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet.”
“Ar, well then,” said Hagrid. “There’s no way yeh could’ve done it…I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh
know — I’ve jus’ bin worried about Aragog…an I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank
had bin teachin’ yeh —”
At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank,
who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time
Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful.
“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying
through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking
noise from one of his back teeth. “And I’ve got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven’t got
much time for dinner.”
As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took
him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron
merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione’s arm
and held her back.
“What?” said Hermione defensively.
“If you ask me,” said Harry quietly, “McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And
he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.”
Hermione blushed.
“Oh, all right then, I did it,” she whispered. “But you should have heard the way he was talking
about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, he’s got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn’t get
in — you wouldn’t have wanted someone like that on the team.”
“No,” said Harry. “No, I suppose that’s true. But wasn’t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean,
you’re a prefect, aren’t you?”
“Oh, be quiet,” she snapped, as he smirked.
“What are you two doing?” demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and
looking suspicious.
“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast
beef made Harry’s stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the
Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path.
“Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!” he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his
walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, “I was hoping to catch you before dinner!
What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We’re having a little party, just a
few rising stars, I’ve got McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin — I don’t
know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries — and, of course, I
hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too.”
Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not
present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him.
“I can’t come, Professor,” said Harry at once. “I’ve got a detention with Professor Snape.”
“Oh dear!” said Slughorn, his face falling comically. “Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry!
Well, now, I’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able
to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later!” He bustled away out of the
Hall.
“He’s got no chance of persuading Snape,” said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot.
“This detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for
anyone else.”
“Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!” said Hermione anxiously; Harry
knew that she was thinking about McLaggen.
“I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,” snapped Ron, who did not seem to have
taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn.
After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very
crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat
down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms
and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which
somebody had left abandoned on a chair.
“Anything new?” said Harry.
“Not really…” Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. “Oh,
look, your dad’s in here, Ron — he’s all right!” she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in
alarm. “It just says he’s been to visit the Malfoys’ house. ‘This second search of the Death Eaters
residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and
Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting
upon a confidential tip-off.’”
“Yeah, mine!” said Harry. “I told him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying
to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it’s not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts
with him —” “But how can he have done, Harry?” said Hermione, putting down the newspaper
with a surprised look. “We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we?”
“Were you?” said Harry, taken aback. “I wasn’t!”
“Oh no, of course you weren’t, I forgot you were late. Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy
Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a
fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can’t have brought in anything
dangerous!”
Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a
while before seeing a way around this objection.
“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said. “His mother or someone.”
“All the owls are being checked too,” said Hermione. “Filch told us so when he was jabbing
those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach.”
Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way
Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron,
who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown.
“Can you think of any way Malfoy —?”
“Oh, drop it, Harry,” said Ron.
“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us
wanted to go, you know!” said Harry, firing up.
“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said Ron, getting to his feet again, “I think I’ll go to
bed.”
He stomped off toward the door to the boys’ dormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring
after him.
“Harry?” said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. “I’ve got a
message for you.”
“From Professor Slughorn?” asked Harry, sitting up hopefully.
“No…from Professor Snape,” said Demelza. Harry’s heart sank. “He says you’re to come to his
office at half past eight tonight to do your detention— er— no matter how many party invitations
you’ve received. And he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good
ones, to use in Potions and — and he says there’s no need to bring protective gloves.”
“Right,” said Harry grimly. “Thanks a lot, Demelza.”
CHAPTER TWELVE
SILVER AND OPALS
Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing?
Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at
meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school
for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry?
Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had
felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.
Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered
whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the
school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the
castle grounds for a few hours.
Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the
time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed
reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except
Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Princes copy of
Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the
more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that was
earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes
scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the
Prince had invented himself.
Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince’s self-invented spells. There had been a hex that
caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very
entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used,
to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a
spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy
conversations could be held in class without being overheard. The only person who did not find
these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout
and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled
instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many
crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry
stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl…that had to mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he
would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the
Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside
his head.
“Aaaaaaaargh!”
There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had
let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in
midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.
“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up
from the floor, having fallen out of Bed. “Hang on — I’ll let you down —”
He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at
last he located it and deciphered the cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the
counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might. There was another flash of light, and
Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress.
“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.
“Tomorrow,” said Ron in a muffled voice, “I’d rather you set the alarm clock.”
By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasleys hand-
knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron’s shock had subsided and he had
decided that Harry’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in
regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast.
“…and then there was another flash, of light and I landed on the bed again!” Ron grinned,
helping himself to sausages.
Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry
disapproval upon Harry.
“Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?” she asked.
Harry frowned at her.
“Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?”
“Was it?”
“Well…yeah, it was, but so what?”
“So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would
happen?”
“Why does it matter if it’s handwritten?” said Harry, preferring not to answer the rest of the
question.
“Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic approved,” said Hermione. “And also,” she added,
as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit
dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. “Just a laugh, Hermione,
that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts their time and energy
into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er —”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had
never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a
wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be —?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only one. We’ve seen a
whole bunch of people use it, in case you’ve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them
float along, asleep, helpless.”
Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters
at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.
“That was different,” he said robustly. “They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having
a laugh. You don’t like the Prince, Hermione,” he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, “because
he’s better than you at Potions —”
“It’s got nothing to do with that!” said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. “I just think it’s very
irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking
about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn’t seem as though he
was a very nice person to me!”
“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly. “If he’d been a budding Death Eater
he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?”
Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the
thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later.
“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough pure-blood wizards left,” said
Hermione stubbornly. “I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only
Muggle-borns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.”
“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying
off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. “My
whole family are blood traitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!”
“And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically. “We’d be best pals if they didn’t keep
trying to do me in.”
This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the
shape of Ginny.
“Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this.”
It was a scroll of parchment with Harry’s name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing.
“Thanks, Ginny…It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open
the parchment and quickly reading its contents.
“Monday evening!” He felt suddenly light and happy. “Want to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?”
he asked.
“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she replied, waving at them as she left.
Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had
permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-
checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.
“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?” demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin
Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. “Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?”
His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped
out into the wind and sleet.
The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the
exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double
against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better
time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s
Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be
fun. Ron pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and
Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.
“Thank God,” shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffee-scented air. “Let’s stay here
all afternoon.”
“Harry, m’boy!” said a booming voice from behind them.
“Oh no,” muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing
an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized
pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop.
“Harry, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now!” said Slughorn, poking him genially
in the chest. “It won’t do, m’boy, I’m determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don’t you?”
“Yes,” said Hermione helplessly, “they’re really —”
“So why don’t you come along, Harry?” demanded Slughorn.
“Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,” said Harry, who had indeed been scheduling
practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy
meant that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining Hermione
shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.
“Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all the hard work!” said Slughorn.
“But a little recreation never hurt any body. Now, how about Monday night, you can’t possibly
want to practice in this weather…”
“I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening.”
“Unlucky again!” cried Slughorn dramatically. “Ah, well…you can’t evade me forever, Harry!”
And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he
had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.
“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said Hermione, shaking her head. “They’re
not that bad, you know…They’re even quite fun sometimes…” But then she caught sight of Ron’s
expression. “Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours!”
Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed much more interest in the new
extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and
merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next.
“Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks,” said Harry. “It’ll be warm.”
They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like
knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody
was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little
ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting
through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade
pub, the Hog’s Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more
tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his
arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was.
“Mundungus!”
The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient
suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.
“Oh, ‘ello, ‘Arry,” said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. “Well,
don’t let me keep ya.”
And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every
appearance of a man eager to be gone.
“Are you selling this stuff?” asked Harry, watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-
looking objects from the ground.
“Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,” said Mundungus. “Gimme that!”
Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.
“Hang on,” Ron said slowly. “This looks familiar —”
“Thank you!” said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ron’s hand and stuffing it back into
the case. “Well, I’ll see you all — OUCH!”
Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with
one hand, he pulled out his wand.
“Harry!” squealed Hermione.
“You took that from Sirius’s house,” said Harry, who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus
and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. “That had the Black family crest
on it.”
“I — no — what —?” spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning purple.
“What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?” snarled Harry.
“I — no —”
“Give it to me!”
“Harry, you mustn’t!” shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue.
There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus’s throat. Gasping and spluttering,
Mundungus seized his fallen case, then — CRACK — he Disapparated.
Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone.
“COME BACK, YOU THIEVING —!”
“There’s no point, Harry.” Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.
“Mundungus will probably be in London by now. There’s no point yelling.”
“He’s nicked Sirius’s stuff! Nicked it!”
“Yes, but still,” said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. “You
should get out of the cold.”
She watched them go through the door of the Three Broom-sticks. The moment he was inside,
Harry burst out, “He was nicking Sirius’s stuff!”
“I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are staring,” whispered Hermione. “Go and sit
down, I’ll get you a drink.”
Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three
bottles of butterbeer.
“Can’t the Order control Mundungus?” Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper.
“Can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?”
“Shh!” said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were
a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was
lolling against a pillar not far away. “Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I know it’s your things he’s stealing
—”
Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve,
Grimmauld Place.
“Yeah, it’s my stuff!” he said. “No wonder he wasn’t pleased to see me! Well, I’m going to tell
Dumbledore what’s going on, he’s the only one who scares Mundungus.”
“Good idea,” whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was calming down. “Ron, what
are you staring at?”
“Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch
the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft
spot.
“I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more firewhisky,” said Hermione waspishly.
Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence.
Harry was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione
drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar. The moment Harry
drained the last drops in his bottle she said, “Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?”
The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer
they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled
on their gloves, then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the High Street.
Harry’s thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen
slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were
cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed
his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.
It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend,
which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted
at their indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was
holding in her hand. “It’s nothing to do with you, Leanne!” Harry heard Katie say.
They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Harry’s glasses. Just as
he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding;
Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground.
At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but
gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong,
something eerie…Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and
her face was quite empty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their
tracks, watching.
Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever
she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and
screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katie’s ankles, trying to tug her back to the
ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs,
she fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they
could hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed,
apparently unable to recognize any of them.
Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.
“Stay there!” he shouted at the others over the howling wind. “I’m going for help!”
He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just
behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided
with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.
“Hagrid!” he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen.
“Harry!” said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his
great, shaggy beaverskin coat. “Jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s comin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ —”
“Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or something —”
“Wha?” said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind.
“Someone’s been cursed!” bellowed Harry.
“Cursed? Who’s bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione?”
“No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way…”
Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find the little group of people
around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne
were all trying to quiet her.
“Get back!” shouted Hagrid. “Lemme see her!”
“Something’s happened to her!” sobbed Leanne. “I don’t know what —”
Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms,
and ran off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katie’s piercing screams had died away and
the only sound was the roar of the wind.
Hermione hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and put an arm around her.
“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?”
The girl nodded.
“Did it just happen all of a sudden, or —?”
“It was when that package tore,” sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brown-paper
package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand
out-stretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back.
“Don’t touch it!”
He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper.
“I’ve seen that before,” said Harry, staring at the thing. “It was on display in Borgin and Burkes
ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have touched it.” He looked up at Leanne, who
had started to shake uncontrollably. “How did Katie get hold of this?”
“Well, that’s why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks
holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all
funny when she said it…Oh no, oh no, I bet she’d been Imperiused and I didn’t realize!”
Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder gently.
“She didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne?”
“No…she wouldn’t tell me…and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but
she just wouldn’t listen and…and then I tried to grab it from her…and — and —”
Leanne let out a wail of despair.
“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne. “We’ll be able to
find out how she is. Come on…”
Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ron’s
gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up.
“We’ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,” he said.
As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking furiously. They had
just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer.
“Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw
him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying
that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!”
“I — I dunno, Harry,” said Ron hesitantly. “Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes…and
didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?”
“She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom
itself —”
“McGonagall!” said Ron warningly.
Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps
through swirling sleet to meet them.
“Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell — upstairs to my office at once, please!
What’s that you’re holding, Potter?”
“It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry.
“Good lord,” said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry.
“No, no, Filch, they’re with me!” she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the
entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. “Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be
sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!”
Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office. The sleet-
spattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in
the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry, Ron,
Hermione, and the still sobbing Leanne.
“Well?” she said sharply. “What happened?”
Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told
Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned
holding the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and how they had argued about
the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over
the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there was no getting another
word out of her.
“All right,” said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, “go up to the hospital wing, please,
Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.”
When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?”
“She rose up in the air,” said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione could speak, “and then
began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?”
“The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised.
“Away?” Harry repeated angrily.
“Yes, Potter, away!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. “But anything you have to say about this
horrible business can be said to me, I’m sure!”
For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences;
Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory,
however wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being
laughed at.
“I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.”
On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione
shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.
“That is a very serious accusation, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause.
“Do you have any proof?”
“No,” said Harry, “but…” and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the
conversation they had over-heard between him and Mr. Borgin.
When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused.
“Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?”
“No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn’t have it
with him. But that’s not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I
think it was that necklace —”
“You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?”
“No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him —”
“But Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and
Malfoy said no —”
“Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said Harry angrily.
“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look carrying that down the street?’” said Hermione.
“Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,” interjected Ron.
“Oh, Ron,” said Hermione despairingly, “it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to
touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved
at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he
carried it down the street — and in any case,” she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, “I
asked Borgin about the necklace, don’t you remember? When I went in to try and find out what
Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say it was
already sold or anything —”
“Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds,
of course he wasn’t going to tell you — anyway, Malfoy could’ve sent off for it since—”
“That’s enough!” said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking
furious. “Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr.
Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same
is probably true of hundreds of people —”
“— that’s what I said —” muttered Ron.
“— and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe
that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge —”
“But —”
“— and what is more,” said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, “Mr. Malfoy
was not in Hogsmeade today.”
Harry gaped at her, deflating.
“How do you know, Professor?”
“Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration
homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,” she said as she
marched past them, “but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day
to you all.”
She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word.
Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled
to join in once they started discussing what had happened.
“So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?” asked Ron, as they climbed
the stairs to the common room.
“Goodness only knows,” said Hermione. “But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one
could have opened that package without touching the necklace.”
“It could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said Harry. “Dumbledore — the Death Eaters
would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn — Dumbledore
reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided with Dumbledore.
Or —”
“Or you,” said Hermione, looking troubled.
“Couldn’t have been,” said Harry, “or Katie would’ve just turned around in the lane and given it
to me, wouldn’t she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made
much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who
goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?”
“Harry, Malfoy wasn’t in Hogsmeade!” said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration.
“He must have used an accomplice, then,” said Harry. “Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of
it, another Death Eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up—”
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There’s no point arguing with him.
“Dilligrout,” said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady.
The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of
damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad
weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie’s fate had not
yet spread.
“It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,” said Ron, casually turfing
a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. “The curse didn’t
even make it into the castle. Not what you’d call foolproof.”
“You’re right,” said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the
first year again. “It wasn’t very well thought-out at all.”
“But since when has Malfoy been one of the world’s great thinkers?” asked Harry.
Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
THE SECRET RIDDLE
Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day,
by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details
were confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that
Katie herself had not been the intended target.
“Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,” said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new
policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.
Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for
Monday night’s lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside
Dumbledore’s office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore looking
unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry
to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the
ceiling.
“You have had a busy time while I have been away,” Dumbledore said. “I believe you witnessed
Katie’s accident.”
“Yes, sir. How is she?”
“Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace
with the smallest possible amount of skin; there was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had
she even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor
Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse —”
“Why him?” asked Harry quickly. “Why not Madam Pomfrey?”
“Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus
Black, Sirius’s great-great-grandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be
sleeping. “I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day.”
“Yes, thank you, Phineas,” said Dumbledore quellingly. “Professor Snape knows much more
about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungo’s staff are sending me
hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.”
“Where were you this weekend, sir?” Harry asked, disregarding a strong feeling that he might be
pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly.
“I would rather not say just now,” said Dumbledore. “However, I shall tell you in due course.”
“You will?” said Harry, startled.
“Yes, I expect so,” said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside
his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.
“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.”
“Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-
fingered contempt,” said Dumbledore, frowning a little. “He has gone to ground since you accosted
him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that
he will not be making away with any more of Sirius’s old possessions.”
“That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?” said Phineas Nigellus, incensed;
and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld
Place.
“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her
after Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?”
“She told me of your suspicions, yes,” said Dumbledore.
“And do you —?”
“I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katie’s
accident,” said Dumbledore. “But what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.”
Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been
such a long gap between the first and second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but
watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone
basin once more between his long-fingered hands.
“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort’s beginnings at the point
where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to
his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who
would one day become Lord Voldemort.”
“How do you know she was in London, sir?”
“Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,” said Dumbledore, “who, by an odd
coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.”
He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before, much as a gold
prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in
the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair that completely covered his
eyes.
“Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before
Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was
obvious. Covered in rags and pretty far along…Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had
been Slytherin’s. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time, ‘Oh, this was Merlin’s, this was, his
favorite teapot,’ but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few simple spells were
enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough priceless. She didn’t seem to have
any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!”
Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back
into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come.
“He only gave her ten Galleons?” said Harry indignantly.
“Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,” said Dumbledore. “So we know that, near
the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate
enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvolo’s treasured
family heirlooms.”
“But she could do magic!” said Harry impatiently. “She could have got food and everything for
herself by magic, couldn’t she?”
“Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is my belief — I am guessing again, but I am
sure I am right — that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not
think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love
and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to
see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life.”
“She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?”
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?”
“No,” said Harry quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t she, not like my mother —”
“Your mother had a choice too,” said Dumbledore gently. “Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in
spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by
long suffering and she never had your mother’s courage. And now, if you will stand…”
“Where are we going?” Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk.
“This time,” said Dumbledore, “we are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both
rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry…”
Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was
falling through darkness again…Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and
found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old-fashioned London street.
“There I am,” said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the
road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart.
This younger Albus Dumbledore’s long hair and beard were auburn. Having reached their side
of the street, he strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the
flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing.
“Nice suit, sir,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as
they followed his younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare
courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. He mounted the
few steps leading to the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was opened
by a scruffy girl wearing an apron.
“Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?”
“Oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance.
“Um…just a mo’…MRS. COLE!” she bellowed over her shoulder.
Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to
Dumbledore. “Come in, she’s on ‘er way.”
Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but
spotlessly clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind
them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharp-featured face
that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned
helper as she walked toward Dumbledore.
“…and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric
Whalley’s oozing all over his sheets — chicken pox on top of everything else,” she said to nobody in
particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as
astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold.
“Good afternoon,” said Dumbledore, holding out his hand. Mrs. Cole simply gaped.
“My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very
kindly invited me here today.”
Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said
feebly, “Oh yes. Well — well then — you’d better come into my room. Yes.”
She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as
shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on
a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously.
“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future,”
said Dumbledore.
“Are you family?” asked Mrs. Cole.
“No, I am a teacher,” said Dumbledore. “I have come to offer Tom a place at my school.”
“What school’s this, then?”
“It is called Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore.
“And how come you’re interested in Tom?”
“We believe he has qualities we are looking for.”
“You mean he’s won a scholarship? How can he have done? He’s never been entered for one.”
“Well, his name has been down for our school since birth —”
“Who registered him? His parents?”
There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently
Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet
suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Cole’s desktop.
“Here,” said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, “I think
this will make everything clear.”
Mrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a
moment.
“That seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a
bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before.
“Er — may I offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an extra-refined voice.
“Thank you very much,” said Dumbledore, beaming.
It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both
of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she
smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn’t hesitate to press his advantage.
“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle’s history? I think he was
born here in the orphanage?”
“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. “I remember it clear as anything,
because I’d just started here myself. New Year’s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty
night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front
steps. Well, she wasn’t the first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was
dead in another hour.”
Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin.
“Did she say anything before she died?” asked Dumbledore. “Anything about the boy’s father,
for instance?”
“Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now,
with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story. “I remember she said to me, ‘I hope he
looks like his papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty — and then
she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know,
funny name, isn’t it? We wondered whether she came from a circus — and she said the boy’s
surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon after that without another word.
“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor
Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the
orphanage and he’s been here ever since.”
Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin. Two pink
spots had appeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, “He’s a funny boy.”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I thought he might be.”
“He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then, when he got a little older,
he was…odd.”
“Odd in what way?” asked Dumbledore gently.
“Well, he —”
But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial
glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass.
“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?”
“Definitely,” said Dumbledore.
“And nothing I say can change that?”
“Nothing,” said Dumbledore.
“You’ll be taking him away, whatever?”
“Whatever,” repeated Dumbledore gravely.
She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. Apparently she decided she
could, because she said in a sudden rush, “He scares the other children.”
“You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore.
“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, “but it’s very hard to catch him at it.
There have been incidents…Nasty things…”
Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested. She took yet
another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still.
“Billy Stubbs’s rabbit…well, Tom said he didn’t do it and I don’t see how he could have done,
but even so, it didn’t hang itself from the rafters, did it?”
“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly.
“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Billy had argued
the day before. And then”— Mrs. Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this
time — “on the summer outing — we take them out, you know, once a year, to the countryside or
to the seaside — well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all we
ever got out of them was that they’d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He swore they’d just gone
exploring, but something happened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of
things, funny things…”
She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was
steady. “I don’t think many people will be sorry to see the back of him.”
“You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?” said Dumbledore.
“He will have to return here, at the very least, every summer.”
“Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a
slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even
though two-thirds of the gin was now gone. “I suppose you’d like to see him?”
“Very much,” said Dumbledore, rising too.
She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out instructions and admonitions to
helpers and children as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of
grayish tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim
place in which to grow up.
“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the
first door in a long corridor. She knocked twice and entered.
“Tom? You’ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton — sorry, Dunderbore. He’s come to tell you
— well, I’ll let him do it.”
Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It
was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe, a wooden chair, and an iron
bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him,
holding a book.
There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle’s face. Merope had got her dying wish: He was
his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed
slightly as he took in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. There was a moment’s silence.
“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking forward and holding out his hand.
The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden
chair beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.
“I am Professor Dumbledore.”
“‘Professor’?” repeated Riddle. He looked wary. “Is that like ‘doctor’? What are you here for? Did
she get you in to have a look at me?”
He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left.
“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
“I don’t believe you,” said Riddle. “She wants me looked at, doesn’t she? Tell the truth!”
He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command,
and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was
glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few
seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still.
“Who are you?”
“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I
have come to offer you a place at my school — your new school, if you would like to come.”
Riddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from
Dumbledore, looking furious.
“You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re from, isn’t it? ‘Professor,’ yes, of course —
well, I’m not going, see? That old cat’s the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to
little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they’ll tell you!”
“I am not from the asylum,” said Dumbledore patiently. “I am a teacher and, if you will sit
down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school,
nobody will force you —”
“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle.
“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddle’s last words, “is a school
for people with special abilities —”
“I’m not mad!”
“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It is a school of magic.”
There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back
and forth between each of Dumbledore’s, as though trying to catch one of them lying.
“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore.
“It’s…it’s magic, what I can do?”
“What is it that you can do?”
“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks;
he looked fevered. “I can make filings move without touching them. I can make animals do what I
want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I
can make them hurt if I want to.”
His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again, staring at his
hands, his head bowed as though in prayer.
“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own quivering fingers. “I knew I was special.
Always, I knew there was something.”
“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle
intently. “You are a wizard.”
Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for
some reason it did not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed
somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.
“Are you a wizard too?”
“Yes, I am.”
“Prove it,” said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said,
“Tell the truth.”
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “If, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwarts -”
“Of course I am!”
“Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’“
Riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably
polite voice, “I’m sorry, sir. I meant — please, Professor, could you show me—?”
Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he would tell Riddle there would be
plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of
Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand
from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave
the wand a casual flick.
The wardrobe burst into flames.
Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his
worldly possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames
vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.
Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the
wand. “Where can I get one of them?”
“All in good time,” said Dumbledore. “I think there is something trying to get out of your
wardrobe.”
And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked
frightened.
“Open the door,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost
shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though
there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.
“Take it out,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.
“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?” asked Dumbledore.
Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. “Yes, I suppose so, sir,” he said finally,
in an expressionless voice.
“Open it,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them. Harry,
who had expected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a
silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped
quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets.
“You will return them to their owners with your apologies,” said Dumbledore calmly, putting his
wand back into his jacket. “I shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not
tolerated at Hogwarts.”
Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at
Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice, “Yes, sir.”
“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you not only to use magic, but to control it.
You have — inadvertently, I am sure — been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor
tolerated at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run
away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic
— yes, there is a Ministry — will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept
that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws.”
“Yes, sir,” said Riddle again.
It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little
cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to
Dumbledore and said baldly, “I haven’t got any money.”
“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket.
“There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might
have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but —”
“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag
without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon.
“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books and school equipment with me. I
can help you find everything —”
“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.
“Certainly, if you —”
“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my
own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley — sir?” he added, catching Dumbledore’s
eye.
Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was
surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after
telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, “You will be
able to see it, although Muggles around you — non-magical people, that is — will not. Ask for Tom
the barman — easy enough to remember, as he shares your name —”
Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly.
“You dislike the name ‘Tom’?”
“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could not suppress the
question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, “Was my father a wizard? He was
called Tom Riddle too, they’ve told me.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.
“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died,” said Riddle, more to himself
than Dumbledore. “It must’ve been him. So — when I’ve got all my stuff — when do I come to this
Hogwarts?”
“All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,” said Dumbledore. “You
will leave from King’s Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.”
Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said,
“I can speak to snakes. I found out when we’ve been to the country on trips — they find me, they
whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?”
Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment,
determined to impress.
“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s hesitation, “but not unheard of.”
His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle’s face. They stood for a moment,
man and boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.
“Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.”
“I think that will do,” said the white-haired Dumbledore at Harry’s side, and seconds later, they
were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-day
office.
“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.
Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.
“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you told him he was a wizard,” said
Harry. “I didn’t believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.”
“Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use his word — ‘special,’” said
Dumbledore.
“Did you know — then?” asked Harry.
“Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?” said Dumbledore.
“No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by
him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in
any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others’
sake as much as his.
“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and —
most interestingly and ominously of all — he had already discovered that he had some measure of
control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random
experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten,
to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured
into a cave were most suggestive…‘I can make them hurt if I want to…’”
“And he was a Parselmouth,” interjected Harry.
“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although as we
know, there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to
serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and
domination.
“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, indicating the dark sky beyond the
windows. “But before we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have
just witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings.
“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first
name, ‘Tom’?”
Harry nodded.
“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made
him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you
know, within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’
behind which he has been hidden for so long.
“I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly self-sufficient, secretive, and,
apparently, friendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He
preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters
claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They
are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry — the young Tom
Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These
were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant
bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.
“And now, it really is time for bed.”
Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell I upon the little table on which
Marvolo Gaunt’s ring had rested last I time, but the ring was no longer there.
“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.
“The ring’s gone,” said Harry, looking around. “But I thought I you might have the mouth
organ or something.”
Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his half moon spectacles.
“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.”
And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood himself to be dismissed.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
FELIX FELICIS
Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and
Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being over-heard, but he
filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend’s
brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than
usual to find the correct greenhouse.
“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said Ron quietly, as they took their places
around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project, and began pulling on
their protective gloves. “But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing you all this. I mean, it’s
really interesting and everything, but what’s the point?”
“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he says it’s all important and it’ll help me
survive.”
“I think it’s fascinating,” said Hermione earnestly. “It makes absolute sense to know as much
about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?”
“So how was Slughorn’s latest party?” Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield.
“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles. “I mean, he
drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well
connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.”
“Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles. “The Gwenog Jones?
Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?”
“That’s right,” said Hermione. “Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but —”
“Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern.
“You’re lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Neville’s already got his first pod!”
They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches
along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a
grapefruit.
“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away
again, “should ve used Muffliato, Harry.”
“No, we shouldn’t!” said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the
thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells. “Well, come on…we’d better get going…”
She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the
gnarled stump between them.
It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped
through the air. One tangled itself in Hermione’s hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs;
Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the
middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which
closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the
hole to open again, and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like
Neville’s. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an
innocently dead lump of wood.
“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden when I’ve got my own place,”
said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.
“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at arm’s length; Harry handed one
over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.
“Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best when they’re fresh!” called Professor Sprout.
“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood
had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way
you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so
he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.”
Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting
both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, “And this is another
party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?”
“Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione.
The pod flew out from under Ron’s fingers and hit the green house glass, rebounding onto the
back of Professor Sprout’s head and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the
pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, I didn’t make up the name ‘Slug Club’ —”
“‘Slug Club,’”repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. “It’s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy
your party. Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and
Queen Slug —”
“We’re allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright,
boiling scarlet, “and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it’s that stupid then I won’t
bother!”
Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting
here with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and
began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately,
he could still hear every word of their conversation.
“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a completely different voice.
“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d rather I hooked up with McLaggen…”
There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.
“‘No, I wouldn’t,’” said Ron, in a very quiet voice.
Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.
“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together
again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry’s presence.
Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees
of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked
sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.
“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It says we’re supposed to puncture them
with something sharp…”
Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their
eyes and dived, once more, for the stump. It was not as though he was really surprised, thought
Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this
might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it…He and Cho were now too
embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione started
going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few
weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to
bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn’t split up? What if they became like
Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut
out for good?
“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst
the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.
The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorn’s party. Although Harry
watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any
different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would just
have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn’s dimly lit room on
the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries.
Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo’s Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the
promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser
short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening
match against Slytherin was looming, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in
time to play.
Harry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had
little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the
class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all
of Hermione’s creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.
“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?”
“Wha —? Yeah, of course!” said Dean excitedly. Over Dean’s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus
Finnegan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have
preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other
hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.
“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice tonight, seven o’clock.”
“Right,” said Dean. “Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can’t wait to tell Ginny!”
He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable
moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus’s head as one of Hermione’s
canaries whizzed over them.
Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie’s substitute. There was much
muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his class-mates for
the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not
particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming
match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that
they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost…well,
Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings…
Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with
Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only
problem was Ron.
Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a
lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season
seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them
scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming
Demelza Robins in the mouth.
“It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged
back to the ground, dripping blood everywhere. “I just —”
“Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. “You prat,
Ron, look at the state of her!”
“I can fix that,” said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelzas mouth,
and saying “Episkey.” “And Ginny, don’t call Ron a prat, you’re not the Captain of this team —”
“Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should —”
Harry forced himself not to laugh.
“In the air, everyone, let’s go…”
Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry did not feel that
honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match.
“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” he said bracingly, and the Chasers and
Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.
“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut
behind Ginny.
“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly. “You’re the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only
problem is nerves.”
He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time
they reached the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open
the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they found themselves
looking at Dean and Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued
together.
It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry’s stomach, clawing at his
insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a
savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron’s voice as
though from a great distance away.
“Oi!”
Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. “What?” said Ginny.
“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!”
“This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!” said Ginny.
Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the
newborn monster inside him was roaring for Dean’s instant dismissal from the team.
“Er…c’mon, Ginny,” said Dean, “let’s go back to the common room…”
“You go!” said Ginny. “I want a word with my dear brother!” Dean left, looking as though he
was not sorry to depart the scene.
“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, “let’s get this
straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron
—”
“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D’ you think I want people saying my sister’s a —”
“A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. “A what, exactly?”
“He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny —” said Harry automatically, though the monster was
roaring its approval of Ron’s words.
“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry. “Just because he’s never snogged anyone in his
life, just because the best kiss he’s ever had is from our Auntie Muriel —”
“Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon.
“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself. “I’ve seen you with Phlegm, hoping she’ll kiss you
on the cheek every time you see her, it’s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done
your self, you wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it!”
Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between them.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny
around Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. “Just because I
don’t do it in public —!”
Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way.
“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under
your pillow?”
“You —”
A streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed
Ron up against the wall.
“Don’t be stupid —”
“Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now. “And
Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and
that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!”
And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was
murderous. They both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Rich’s cat, appeared around
the corner, which broke the tension.
“C’mon,” said Harry, as the sound of Filch’s shuffling feet reached their ears.
They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. “Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked
at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.
Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a
lightning bolt must be something like this. It’s just because she’s Ron’s sister, he told himself. You just
didn’t like seeing her kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister…
But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing
Ginny instead…The monster in his chest purred…but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry
curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like “betrayal of trust”…“supposed to be
my friend”…
“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady.
Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron
intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone —
“What?” he said confusedly. “Oh…er…” The honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to
give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry’s face.
“Dilligrout,” he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the
common room.
Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other
that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts, Harry lay awake for a
long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his
feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister
all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had
known Ginny for years now…It was natural that he should feel protective…natural that he should
want to look out for her…want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her…No…he would have to
control that particular brotherly feeling…
Ron gave a great grunting snore.
She’s Ron’s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron’s sister. She’s out-of-bounds. He would not risk
his friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and
waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.
Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which
Ron had chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream
Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt
and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have
become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent
the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally,
Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys’ dormitory after
swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him.
To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it
coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so
that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturdays match, he failed to save every single goal
the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to
tears.
“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, who was about two-thirds Ron’s height,
though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.
“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering in Ron’s direction and,
remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to
intervene before things got out of hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull
yourself together, you played really well today, Ron…” he waited until the rest of the team were out
of earshot before saying it, “you’re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and
I’m going to kick you off the team.”
He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse
happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of him and he said, “I resign. I’m
pathetic.”
“You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of
his robes. “You can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a mental problem you’ve got!”
“You calling me mental?”
“Yeah, maybe I am!”
They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily. “I know you haven’t
got any time to find another Keeper, so I’ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I’m taking
myself off the team.”
Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron’s confidence all through dinner,
but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the
common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left
was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant
corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry
again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this
strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and
hopeless as ever.
Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming
match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at
Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done
in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim…
If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together…make him play at
the top of his form…something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day…
And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.
Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as
every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a
clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.
The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry
grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.
“Cheer up, Ron!” called Lavender. “I know you’ll be brilliant!”
Ron ignored her.
“Tea?” Harry asked him. “Coffee? Pumpkin juice?”
“Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.
A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ron’s recent unpleasant behavior
that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.
“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron’s head.
“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice.
“There you go, Ron. Drink up.”
Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke sharply.
“Don’t drink that, Ron!”
Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.
“Why not?” said Ron.
Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.
“You just put something in that drink.”
“Excuse me?” said Harry.
“You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron’s drink. You’ve got the bottle in
your hand right now!”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his
pocket.
“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass,
drained it in one gulp, and said,
“Stop bossing me around, Hermione.”
She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could hear her, she hissed, “You should
be expelled for that. I’d never have believed it of you, Harry!”
“Look who’s talking,” he whispered back. “Confunded anyone lately?”
She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without regret. Hermione had
never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who
was smacking his lips.
“Nearly time!’ said Harry blithely.
The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium.
“Pretty lucky the weathers this good, eh?” Harry asked Ron.
“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.
Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing
room.
“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron. “And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser
Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he’s too sore to play!
And even better than that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too!”
“What?” said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. “He’s ill? What’s wrong with him?”
“No idea, but it’s great for us,” said Ginny brightly. “They’re playing Harper instead; he’s in my
year and he’s an idiot.”
Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from
Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he
had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why
was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking?
“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron. “Malfoy not playing?”
“Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more animated. “And Vaisey off too, he’s their best
goal scorer, I didn’t fancy — hey!” he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers
gloves and staring at Harry.
“What?”
“I…you…” Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared and excited. “My drink…my
pumpkin juice…you didn’t…?”
Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, “We’ll be starting in about five minutes,
you’d better get your boots on.”
They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid
red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides
too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood’s
famous lion-topped hat.
Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls
from the crate.
“Captains shake hands,” she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain,
Urquhart. “Mount your brooms. On the whistle…three…two…one…”
The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they
were away.
Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping
one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to
the usual commentator’s started up.
“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to see the team that Potter’s put together this
year. Many thought, given Ronald Weasley’s patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might
be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help…”
These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry
craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator’s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy
with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been
Lee Jordan’s; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.
“Oh, and here comes Slytherin’s first attempt on goal, it’s Urquhart streaking down the pitch
and —”
Harry’s stomach turned over.
“— Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose…”
“That’s right, Smith, he is,” muttered Harry, grinning to himself, as he dived amongst the
Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having
made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four
of Gryffindor’s six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two
Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.
“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a Beater,” said Zacharias loftily, “they’ve
generally got a bit more muscle —”
“Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly,
chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite
direction. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark.
It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and
again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling
now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favorite
“Weasley Is Our King,” he pretended to conduct them from on high.
“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly
knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. “Your blood-traitor
pal…”
Madam Hooch’s back was turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time
she looked around, Harper had already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him,
determined to ram him back…
“And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” said Zacharias Smith through his
megaphone. “Yes, he’s certainly seen something Potter hasn’t!”
Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he noticed them collide? But next moment, his
stomach seemed to drop out of the, sky — Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not
sped upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high
above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.
Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith’s
commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred
points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost…and now Harper was feet from it, his hand
outstretched…
“Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation. “How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead
of him?”
He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch,
let it slip through his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering
ball and caught it.
“YES!” Hairy yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the ground, the Snitch held high
in his hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned
the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.
“Ginny, where’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had found hint self trapped in the midst of a
mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an
almighty crash, she collided with the commentators podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the
Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring;
Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, “Forgot to brake, Professor,
sorry.”
Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly.
Avoiding her gaze, he clapped cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the
Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air and waving to their supporters.
The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. “Party up in the common room, Seamus
said!” yelled Dean exuberantly. “C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!”
Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They were just about to leave when
Hermione entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but
determined. “I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep breath. “You shouldn’t have done it.
You heard Slughorn, its illegal.”
“What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded Ron.
“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that
neither of them would see him grinning,
“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said Hermione shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s
juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!”
“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both.
“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing
and Ron saved everything!”
“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket
and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden
potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it
when I knew you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt lucky.
You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded. “But the weather’s
good…and Vaisey couldn’t play…I honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating
her voice. “You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this morning, that’s why he saved everything! See! I can
save goals without help, Hermione!”
“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d been given it too!”
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.
“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this,
“shall…shall we go up to the party, then?”
“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I’m sick of Ron at the moment, I don’t know
what I’m supposed to have done…”
And she stormed out of the changing room too.
Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom
shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron
won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could
possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not
when the offense had occurred so long ago.
Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when
he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a
mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted
a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least
amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At
last, he extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to
Slughorn’s Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight
into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at
her heels.
“Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He’s over there, the filthy hypocrite.”
Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood
Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
“It looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?” said Ginny dispassionately. “But I suppose he’s got
to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.”
She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked
off to help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon
Arnold.
Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the
portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair
whipping out of sight.
He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat
Lady. The corridor outside, seemed to be deserted.
“Hermione?”
He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher’s desk,
alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just
conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spell-work at a time like this.
“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was just practicing.”
“Yeah…they’re — er — really good…” said Harry.
He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she
had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy,
when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations.”
“Er…does he?” said Harry.
“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione. “He wasn’t exactly hiding it, was —?”
The door behind them burst open. To Harry’s horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender
by the hand.
“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione.
“Oops!” said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, giggling. The door swung shut behind
her.
There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to
look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, Harry! Wondered
where you’d got to!”
Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around
her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.
“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she said quietly. “She’ll wonder where you’ve
gone.”
She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking
relieved that nothing worse had happened.
“Oppugno!” came a shriek from the doorway.
Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little
flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his
face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could
reach.
“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open
the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid
had already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of
holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from
inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along
the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time
Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, Harry’s frequent
nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways,
so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.
Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than
hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing,
joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the
improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of
Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment
wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed
unlikely ever to speak to each other again.
Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione’s bird attack, was
taking a defensive and resentful tone.
“She can’t complain,” he told Harry. “She snogged Krum. So she’s found out someone wants to
snog me too. Well, it’s a free country. I haven’t done anything wrong.”
Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have
read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Quest). Determined as he was to remain friends
with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.
“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled. “I mean, all right, I was going to go to
Slughorn’s Christmas party with her, but she never said…just as friends…I’m a free agent…”
Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron’s voice trailed away
in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the
words “Krum” and “Can’t complain” again.
Hermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when
Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was
doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, so Harry generally joined
her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.
“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” said Hermione, while the librarian, Madam
Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. “I really couldn’t care less.”
She raised her quill and dotted an ‘i’ so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment.
Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little
lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally
pausing to decipher the prince’s useful additions to Libatius Borage’s text.
“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few moments, “you need to be careful.”
“For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after three-quarters of an hour
of silence, “I am not giving back this book. I’ve learned more from the Half-blood prince than Snape
or Slughorn have taught me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called prince,” said Hermione, giving his book a nasty
look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about earlier. I went into the girl’s bathroom
just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane,
trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take
them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love potions, which
I’m afraid to say probably work —”
“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that
Hermione’s mania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said Hermione scornfully, “They
were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince” she gave the book another scornful
look “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I’d just invite someone
to go with you, that’ll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a chance. It’s tomorrow night,
they’re getting desperate.”
“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about
Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams
in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.
“Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business.”
said Hermione grimly.
She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithmancy essay and
continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry watched her with his mind a long way away.
“Hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasley’s
Wizard Wheezes?”
“And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?” asked Hermione, still
concentrating on her essay.
“But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these girls are able to bring love
potions into the school?”
“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,” said Hermione. “It’s
part of their Owl order service.”
“You know a lot about it.”
Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-
Making.
“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,” she said coldly,
“I don’t go around putting potions in people’s drinks…or pretending too either, which is just as
bad…”
“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. “The point is, Filch is being fooled isn’t he?
These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have
brought the necklace into the school —?”
“Oh, Harry…not that again…”
“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry.
“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don’t
they? They’re used to find dark magic and dark objects. They’d have picked up a powerful curse, like
the one in the necklace, within seconds. But something that’s just been put in the wrong bottle
wouldn’t register — anyway Love potions aren’t dark or dangerous -”
“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.
“— so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion, and he’s not a very good
wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from —”
Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them
among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of
Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long
hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.
“The library is now closed,” she said, “Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the
correct — what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?”
“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-
Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.
“Spoiled!” she hissed. “Desecrated, befouled!”
“It’s just a book that’s been written on!” said Harry, tugging it out of her grip.
She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things,
grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away.
“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid
book?”
“It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or d’you think she overheard you being rude
about Filch? I’ve always thought there might be something between them…”
“Oh, ha ha…”
Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted
lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were
secretly in love with each other.
“Baubles” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password.
“Same to you,” said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them.
“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. “Fancy
a gillywater?”
Hermione gave him a “what-did-I-tell-you?” look over her shoulder.
“No thanks,” said Harry quickly. “I don’t like it much.”
“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons,
they’ve got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don’t like them.”
“Oh — right — thanks a lot.” said Harry, who could not think what else to say. “Er — I ‘ m
just going over here with…”
He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.
“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly, “ Sooner you ask someone, sooner they’ll all leave you
alone and you can —”
But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were
intertwined in the same armchair.
“Well, good night, Harry” said Hermione, though it was only seven o’clock in the evening, and
she left for the girl s’ dormitory without another word.
Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle
through, plus Slughorn’s party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the Burrow. It
now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays
began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their
behavior…
But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson
with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human
transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their
own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, during which he
somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel
but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor
McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which
reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half
her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron’s just now, scooped up her
remaining possessions and followed her.
He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl’s bathroom on the floor below. She was
accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back.
“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?”
“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff…”
He held out her books.
“Oh, yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide
the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. “Thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get
going…”
And she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though
admittedly he could not think of any.
“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned
out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasley…”
“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry.
“He says funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” said Luna as they set off down the corridor
together. “But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.”
“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable
truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. “So have you had a good term?”
“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though.
She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day —”
“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me tonight?”
The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as
though it were a stranger speaking.
Luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise.
“Slughorn’s party? With you?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “We’re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like…I mean…”
He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. “I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you
don’t want to…”
He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to.
“Oh no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam
before. “Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow,
for the party? Should I dye mine too?”
“No” said Harry firmly, “That was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So I’ll
meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then.”
“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them,
they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and
grinning maliciously at them.
“Potty asked Loony to go to the party! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!”
And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, “Potty loves Loony!”
“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole
school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn’s party.
“You could’ve taken anyone!” said Ron in disbelief over dinner. “Anyone! And you chose Loony
Lovegood?”
“Don’t call her that, Ron!” snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends.
“I’m really glad you’re taking her Harry, she’s so excited.”
And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was
glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table
Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively.
“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly.
“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered Ron.
“What did you have to imitate her for?”
“She laughed at my mustache!”
“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.”
But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in
between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron’s neck.
“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior
of their two friends.
“Hi,” said Harry, “How’re you? You’re staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted
you to leave.”
“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” said Parvati. “That Katie thing really
freaked them out, but as there hasn’t been anything since…Oh, hi, Hermione!”
Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at
Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if
possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.
“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. “Are you going to
Slughorn’s party tonight?”
“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, though, it sounds like it’s going to be really
good…You’re going, aren’t you?”
“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re —”
There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink, and Ron surfaced.
Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything.
“— we’re going up to the party together.”
“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you mean?”
“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who almost” - she put a great deal of emphasis
on the word — “became Gryffindor Keeper.”
“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, wide-eyed.
“Oh - yes - didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.
“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece of gossip. “Wow, you like your
Quidditch players, don’t you? First Krum, then McLaggen.”
“I like really good Quidditch players,” Hermione corrected her, still smiling. “Well, see you…Got
to go and get ready for the party…”
She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development,
with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about
Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the
depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.
When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night, he found an unusually large
number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached
Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles
from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had
left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs.
“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?”
“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?”
“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and
muttering. “Did you hear, there’s supposed to be a vampire coming?”
“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna.
“I - what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the Minister of Magic?”
“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. “Father wrote a very long article about it when
Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody
from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get out!”
Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to
Luna repeating her father’s bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already
approaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were
growing louder with every step they took.
Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so,
Slughorn’s office was much larger than the usual teacher’s study. The ceiling and walls had been
draped with emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a
vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden
lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant
speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant
corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number
of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the
heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.
“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through
the door. “Come in, come in, so many people I’d like you to meet!”
Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so
tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the
party; Harry seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him.
“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of Blood Brothers:
My Life Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend Sanguini.”
Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry’s hand and shook it
enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his
eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking
curious and excited.
“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry’s face.
“I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for
which we have all been waiting?’“
“Er,” said Harry, “were you?”
“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. “But seriously”— his manner changed; it
became suddenly businesslike — “I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to
know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in
four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very
little effort on your part, I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t quite — Sanguini, stay here!”
added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a
rather hungry look in his eye. “Here, have a pasty,” said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and
stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand before turning his attention back to Harry.
“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea —”
“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and I’ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.” He
pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear
between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters.
“Hermione! Hermione!”
“Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!”
“What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as
though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare.
“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left Cormac,” she said. “Under the mistletoe,” she
added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her.
“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her severely.
“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione dispassionately. “I debated for a while about
Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole —”
“You considered Smith?” said Harry, revoked.
“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman.
Let’s go this way, we’ll be able to see him coming, he’s so tall…” The three of them made their way
over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that
Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.
“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney.
“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty.
Harry could smell cooking sherry again. “I haven’t seen you in my classes lately…”
“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna.
“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. “Or Dobbin, as I prefer
to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school
Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no…we share classes…It’s an insult,
frankly, an insult. Do you know…”
Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. Under cover of her furious
criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, “Let‘s get something straight. Are you
planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?”
Hermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think I’d stoop that low?”
Harry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can ask out McLaggen —”
“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. “I’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about
what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.”
“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall apart again, and we’ll lose the next match
—”
“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn’t asked me one
single question about myself, no, I’ve just been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac
McLaggen’ nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!” She moved so fast it was as though she had
Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches
and vanished.
“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later.
“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna’s conversation, forgetting for a
split second to whom she was talking.
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time.
“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically.
“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. “The rumors! The stories! ‘The Chosen One’!
Of course, I have known for a very long time…The omens were never good, Harry…But why have
you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!”
“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most important!” said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared
at Professor Trelawney s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in
one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I don’t think I’ve ever known such a natural
at Potions!” said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you know —
like his mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why
even Severus —”
And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air
toward them.
“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” hiccuped Slughorn happily. “I was just talking
about Harry’s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for
five years!”
Trapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at
Harry, his black eyes narrowed.
“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.”
“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. “You should have seen what he gave me, first
lesson, Draught of Living Death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t
think even you, Severus —”
“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last
thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.
“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, Harry?” asked Slughorn.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology…”
“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said Snape with the faintest sneer.
“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry defiantly.
“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn.
“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at
her. “The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They’re
planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and
gum disease.”
Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh. Really, it had been worth
bringing Luna just for this. Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he
saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being dragged by the ear
toward them by Argus Filch.
“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-
detection in his bulging eyes, “I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to
have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an
invitation?”
Malfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip, looking furious. “All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said
angrily. “I was trying to gate crash, happy?”
“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. “You’re in
trouble, you are! Didn’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling’s out, unless you’ve got
permission, didn’t he, eh?”
“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said Slughorn, waving a hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s
not a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay,
Draco.
Filich’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Harry
wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at
Malfoy as though both angry and…was it possible?…a little afraid?
But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away,
muttering under his breath; Malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn
for his generosity, and Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again.
“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy’s thanks. “I did know your
grandfather, after all…”
“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy quickly. “Said you were the best potion-
maker he’d ever known…”
Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do
that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the
first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his
eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.
“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly.
“Now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, “it’s Christmas, don’t be too hard —”
“I am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,” said Snape curtly.
“Follow me, Draco.”
They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment,
irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom.”
“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd,
resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely
interested.
It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it
over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and
Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still
issuing from Slughorn’s office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the
dungeons…or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin common room…Harry pressed
his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement,
he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.
“…cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled —”
“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?”
“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and foolish. Already you are
suspected of having a hand in it.”
“Who suspects me?” said Malfoy angrily. “For the last time, I didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl
must’ve had an enemy noone knows about — don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re doing,
I’m not stupid, but it won’t work — I can stop you!”
There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah…Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you
Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?”
“I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don’t want you butting in!” Harry pressed
his ear still more closely against the keyhole…What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape
like this — Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?
“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You
realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be
there, Draco —”
“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” jeered Malfoy.
There was another pause. Then Snape said, “You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do
either of those things.”
“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!”
“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against
the keyhole to hear. “I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made
the Unbreakable Vow, Draco —”
“Looks like you’ll have to break it, then, because I don’t need your protection! It’s my job, he
gave it to me and I’m doing it, I’ve got a plan and it’s going to work, it’s just taking a bit longer than
I thought it would!”
“What is your plan?”
“It’s none of your business!”
“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you…”
“I have all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not alone!”
“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors
without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes —”
“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn’t put them in detention!”
“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice had risen excitedly. “If your friends
Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L this time around, they
will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres —”
“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark Arts — its all just a joke, isn’t it,
an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts —”
“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where do you think I would have
been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious,
wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants
like Crabbe and Goyle —”
“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my side, better people!”
“Then why not confide in me, and I can —”
“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my glory!”
There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, “You are speaking like a child. I quite
understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but —”
Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard Malfoy’s footsteps on the other side of the door
and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open. Malfoy was striding away down the corridor,
past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight.
Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the
classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor,
hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS
“So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?”
“If you ask that once more,” said Harry, “I’m going to stick this sprout —”
“I’m only checking!” said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a
mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.
“Yes, Snape was offering to help him!” said Harry. “He said he’d promised Malfoy’s mother to
protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something —”
“An Unbreakable Vow?” said Ron, looking stunned. “Nah, he can’t have…Are you sure?”
“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry. “Why, what does it mean?”
“Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow…”
“I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?”
“You die,” said Ron simply. “Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about
five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went
mental,” said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. “Only time I’ve ever seen Dad as angry as
Mum, Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.”
“Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock —”
“I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins entered the kitchen.
“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and everything. Bless them.”
“I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said Ron grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do
it by magic!”
“But meanwhile,” said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it,
“we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a — whoops-a-daisy!”
“You made me do that!” said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. “You wait, when I’m
seventeen —”
“I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,” yawned Fred.
“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,” said George, “what is this we hear from
Ginny about you and a young lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?”
Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts.
“Mind your own business.”
“What a snappy retort,” said Fred. “I really don’t know how you think of them. No, what we
wanted to know was…how did it happen?”
“What d’you mean?”
“Did she have an accident or something?”
“What?”
“Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!”
Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had
turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand,
“Ron!” she said furiously. “Don’t you ever let me see you throwing knives again!”
“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout
mountain.
“Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in
with you two.”
“No problem,” said George.
“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves Harry and Ron in the attic, and if Fleur
shares with Ginny —”
“— that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas —” muttered Fred.
“— everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have a bed, anyway,” said Mrs. Weasley,
sounding slightly harassed.
“Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?” asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before
she answered.
“No, he’s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.”
“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. “One of the two.
Well, let’s get going, then, George.”
“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use
your wand and then we’ll be free too!”
“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. “It’s very character-building stuff,
learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and
Squibs —”
“— and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added George, throwing the paper airplane at
him, “I wouldn’t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty
girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous…almost like real
magic…”
“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. “Would’ve
only taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone too.”
“I couldn’t,” said Harry. “I promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying
here.”
“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, “Are you going to tell
Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?”
“Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of
the list. I might have another word with your dad too.”
“Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though.”
“I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.”
There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, “Course, you know what they’ll all say?
Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They’ll say Snape isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was
just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to.”
“They didn’t hear him,” said Harry flatly. “No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape.”
“Yeah…I’m just saying, though” said Ron.
Harry turned to face him, frowning. “You think I’m right, though?”
“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order,
aren’t they?”
Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection
to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so
he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing…
This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he
had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn’s party before he returned to it, or so he had
been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to
the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had
time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they
got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and
Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time.
Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to
something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying “I told you so,” which he had
done several times to Ron already.
Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the
Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room,
which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred,
George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually
a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner.
Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back, it
glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato
and rather hairy feet.
They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer,
Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who
seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley
kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under
cover of a particularly jazzy number called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” Fred and George
started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as
though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-
looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear
Celestinas voice.
Oh, come and stir my cauldron,
And if you do it right,
I’ll boil you up some hot strong love
To keep you warm tonight.
“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting.
“Do you remember, Arthur?”
“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh
yes…marvelous tune…”
With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to
him.
“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the
chorus. “Be over soon.”
“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy at the Ministry?”
“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests
we’ve made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater — only
don’t repeat that, Harry,” he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.
“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” asked Harry.
“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know Dumbledore’s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour
about Stan…I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a
Death Eater as this satsuma…but the top levels want to look as though they’re making some
progress, and ‘three arrests’ sounds better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases’…but again, this is
all top secret…”
“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark
on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called
“You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.”
“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?”
“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went and searched the Malfoys’ house. There
was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn’t have been there.”
“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked…but this is something different…Well,
something more…”
And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape, As Harry
spoke, he saw Lupin’s head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished,
there was silence, except for Celestina’s crooning.
Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone?
It’s left me for a spell…
“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, “that Snape was simply pretending —?”
“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy’s up to?” said Harry quickly.
“Yeah, I thought you’d say that. But how do we know?”
“It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now
and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. “It’s Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and
that ought to be good enough for all of us.”
“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape —”
“People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s
judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.”
“But Dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued Harry. “He says it himself. And you”— he
looked Lupin straight in the eye — “do you honestly like Snape?”
“I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin. “No, Harry, I am speaking the truth,” he added,
as Harry pulled a skeptical expression. “We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that
happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not
forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every
month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.”
“But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, so you had to leave!” said Harry angrily.
Lupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job,
but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me
healthy. I must be grateful.”
“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!” said Harry.
“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin with a faint smile. “And I understand; with
James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means
tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the
matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on
Dumbledore’s orders that Severus questioned Draco.”
…and now you’ve torn it quite apart
I’ll thank you to give back my heart!
Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the
wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.
“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, what an ‘orrible —”
“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. “Who wants
eggnog?”
“What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the
eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.
“Oh, I’ve been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost literally. That’s why I haven’t been able to
write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.”
“What do you mean?”
“I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said Lupin. “Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s
look of incomprehension. “Nearly all of them are on Voldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy
and here I was…ready-made.”
He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, “I
am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been
difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you
see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing — and sometimes
killing — to eat.”
“How come they like Voldemort?”
“They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,” said Lupin. “And it is hard to argue
with Greyback out there…”
“Who’s Greyback?”
“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed convulsively in his lap. “Fenrir Greyback is,
perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to
contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the
wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in
children…Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate
normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and daughters; it is a
threat that usually produces good results.”
Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who bit me.”
“What?” said Harry, astonished. “When — when you were a kid, you mean?”
“Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the
werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control,
knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he
positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this
is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand
of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback’s insistence that we werewolves
deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem —”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my ‘furry little
problem’ in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved
rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more
cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded
him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title you’re thinking of
adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood Prince is someone who
used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented.
One of them was Levicorpus —”
“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin reminiscently. “There
were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move for being hoisted into the air by your
ankle.”
“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.”
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but
he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding.
“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it was very popular…You know how these
spells come and go…”
“But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,” Harry persisted.
“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.”
He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, “James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise
you, he never asked us to call him ‘Prince.’“
Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you?”
“Definitely not.”
“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s helped me out a lot in Potions
classes, the Prince has.”
“How old is this book, Harry?”
“I dunno, I’ve never checked.”
“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin.
Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong
Love,” which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the
cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic bedroom, where a camp bed
had been added for Harry.
Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of
Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he
finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-lished. It was nearly fifty years
old. Neither his father, nor his father’s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling
disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over,
thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into
an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children…
“She’s got to be joking…”
Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his
glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front
of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.
“What’s that?” asked Harry.
“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted. “She can’t honestly think I’d wear…”
Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold
letters were the words:
“My sweetheart”
“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.”
“If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, “I — I — I’ll—”
“Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning. “Come on, would I?”
“How could she think I’d like something like that, though?” Ron demanded of thin air, looking
rather shocked.
“Well, think back,” said Harry. “Have you ever let it slip that you’d like to go out in public with
the words ‘My Sweetheart’ round your neck?”
“Well…we don’t really talk much,” said Ron. “It’s mainly…”
“Snogging,” said Harry.
“Well, yeah,” said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, “Is Hermione really going out with
McLaggen?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “They were at Slughorn’s party together, but I don’t think it went that
well.”
Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.
Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-
knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a
slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading To Master, From Kreacher.
Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked.
“Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still being searched at the Ministry,” replied Ron,
though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.
“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas
presents?” asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.
“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.”
A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package
contained a large number of maggots. “Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very thoughtful.”
“I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.
Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone
except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley
herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat glittering with what looked like
tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.
“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they beautiful?”
“Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we’re washing our own socks,”
said George, waving an airy hand. “Parsnips, Remus?”
“Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick
it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.
“‘Ow ‘orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.
“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?”
In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy
soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.
“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks.
“She is always knocking —”
“I invited dear Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with
unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. “But she wouldn’t come. Have you spoken to her lately,
Remus?”
“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said Lupin. “But Tonks has got her
own family to go to, hasn’t she?”
“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend
Christmas alone, actually.”
She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a
daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits
of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was,
however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin,
the man who knew all about Patronuses?
“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. “Snape said so anyway. I didn’t know
that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?”
Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, “Sometimes…a
great shock…an emotional up-heaval…”
“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his
voice. “Hey…it couldn’t be —?”
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over
her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. “Arthur — it’s Percy!”
“What?”
Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a
better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed
glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.
“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!”
And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy’s
wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any
of, them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do more than exchange stunned
looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.
There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, “Merry Christmas,
Mother.”
“Oh, Percy!” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.
Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he
observed this affecting scene.
“You must forgive this intrusion,” he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming
and wiping her eyes. “Percy and I were in the vicinity — working, you know — and he couldn’t
resist dropping in and seeing you all.”
But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-
straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else’s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and
George were all observing him, stony-faced.
“Please, come in, sit down, Minister!” fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. “Have a
little purkey, or some tooding…I mean —”
“No, no, my dear Molly,” said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with
Percy before they entered the house. “I don’t want to intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t
wanted to see you all so badly…”
“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.
“…We’ve only looked in for five minutes, so I’ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up
with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your
charming garden…Ah, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t he take a stroll with me?”
The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to
Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour’s pretense that he did not know Harry’s name
convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the
garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence.
He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy
wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour
could speak to Harry alone.
“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. “Fine,” he
added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.
“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him.
“We’ll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I’ll be off. Carry on, everyone!”
Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys’ overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour
limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough
and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.
“Charming,” said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn
and the indistinguishable plants. “Charming.”
Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.
“I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. “Did you
know that?”
“No,” said Harry truthfully.
“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,” said
Scrimgeour. “Natural, of course, natural, after what you’ve been through…Especially what
happened at the Ministry…”
He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, so he went on, “I have been
hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has — most
understandably, as I say — prevented this.”
Still, Harry said nothing, waiting.
“The rumors that have flown around!” said Scrimgeour. “Well, of course, we both know how
these stories get distorted…all these whispers of a prophecy…of you being ‘the Chosen One’…”
They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.
“I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?”
Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome
prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had
caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the
truth…or a bit of it.
“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.”
“Have you, have you…” said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye,
Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked
its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. “And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?”
“Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and
Scrimgeour’s tone, too, was light and friendly as he said,
“Oh, of course, if it’s a question of confidences, I wouldn’t want you to divulge…no, no…and
in any case, does it really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One’ or not?”
Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. “I don’t really know what
you mean, Minister.”
“Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,” said Scrimgeour with a laugh. “But to the
Wizarding community at large…it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s what people believe that’s
important.”
Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going
to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its
roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.
“People believe you are ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” said Scrimgeour. “They think you quite the
hero — which, of course, you are, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,” he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, “the point is,
you are a symbol of hope for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be
able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named — well, naturally, it
gives people a lift. And I can’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well,
almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.”
The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying
to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry
to the gnome, “Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you, Harry?”
“I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said Harry slowly. “‘Stand alongside the
Ministry’…What does that mean?”
“Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,” said Scrimgeour. “If you were to be seen
popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right
impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample opportunity to speak to
Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you
cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily…”
Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the
Ministry, was she?
“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, “you’d like to give the
impression that I’m working for the Ministry?”
“It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,” said Scrimgeour,
sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. “‘The Chosen One,’ you know…It’s all
about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening…”
“But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice
friendly, “won’t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry’s up to?”
“Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, that’s partly why we’d like —”
“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly. “You see, I don’t like some of the things
the Ministry’s doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.”
Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. “I would not
expect you to understand,” he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as
Harry had been. “These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen
years old —”
“Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t think Stan should be in Azkaban either,”
said Harry. “You’re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.”
They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth,
“I see. You prefer — like your hero, Dumbledore — to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?”
“I don’t want to be used,” said Harry.
“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the Ministry!”
“Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before
you chuck them in prison,” said Harry, his temper rising now. “You’re doing what Barty Crouch
did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we’ve got Fudge, pretending everything’s
lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we’ve got you, chucking the wrong people
into jail and trying to pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!” ‘
“So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour.
“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said Harry, with a bitter laugh. “Not to you
anyway.”
“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly. “It was tactless —”
“No, it was honest,” said Harry. “One of the only honest things you’ve said to me. You don’t
care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you’re winning the war
against Voldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister…”
He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which
Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.
“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was
back. The Ministry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.”
They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to
extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of
the rhododendron bush.
“What is Dumbledore up to?” said Scrimgeour brusquely. “Where does he go when he is absent
from Hogwarts?”
“No idea,” said Harry.
“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said Scrimgeour, “would you?”
“No, I wouldn’t,” said Harry.
“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out by other means.”
“You can try,” said Harry indifferently. “But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I’d have thought
you’d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he’s
not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d leave Dumbledore alone, if I were
you.”
There was a long pause.
“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,” said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold
and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, “Dumbledore’s man through and through, aren’t you,
Potter?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that out.”
And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house.
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
A SLUGGISH MEMORY
Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the
kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo
Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say
good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved
into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been
crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses
splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit).
“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her
shoulder. “It’s okay…”
“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his
cheek, “or about Percy. He’s such a prat, it’s not really a loss, is it?”
Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms.
“Promise me you’ll look after yourself…Stay out of trouble…”
“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet life, you know me.”
She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, then, all of you…”
Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted “Hogwarts!” He had one last fleeting view of
the Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. Weasley’s tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very
fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before
he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in
Professor McGonagall’s office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the
grate.
“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.”
“No, Professor.”
Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When
Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall’s office and off toward Gryffindor
Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over
grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see
Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.
“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler
than usual and winced at his loud voice.
“No,” she said.
“What d’you mean, ‘no’?
“There is a new password,” she said. “And please don’t shout.”
“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to —?”
“Harry! Ginny!”
Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves.
“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean
Witherwings,” she said breathlessly. “Did you have a good Christmas?”
“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim —”
“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign
that she had heard him. “Oh, hang on — password. Abstinence.”
“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole.
“What’s up with her?” asked Harry.
“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way
into the packed common room. “She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in
that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anyway…”
She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with
Dumbledore’s writing on it.
“Great,” said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was
scheduled for the following night. “I’ve got loads to tell him — and you. Let’s sit down —”
But at that moment there was a loud squeal of “Won-Won!” and Lavender Brown came hurtling
out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron’s arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a
tinkling laugh and said, “There’s a table over here…Coming, Ginny?”
“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she
did not sound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling,
match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table.
“So how was your Christmas?”
“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Nothing special. How was it at Won-Won’s?”
“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry. “Look, Hermione, can’t you —”
“No, I can’t,” she said flatly. “So don’t even ask.”
“I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas —”
“It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine, Harry, not me. So what was
this important news you wanted to tell me?”
She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and
recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione
sat in thought for a moment and then said, “Don’t you think —?”
“— he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s
doing?”
“Well, yes,” said Hermione.
“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said grudgingly. “But this definitely proves Malfoy’s
planning something, you can’t deny that.”
“No, I can’t,” she answered slowly.
“And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I said!”
“Hmm…did either of them actually mention Voldemort’s name?”
Harry frowned, trying to remember. “I’m not sure…Snape definitely said ‘your master,’ and
who else would that be?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “Maybe his father?”
She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron.
“How’s Lupin?”
“Not great,” said Harry, and he told her all about Lupin’s mission among the werewolves and
the difficulties he was facing. “Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?”
“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sounding startled. “And so have you, Harry!”
“When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened…”
“No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!” said Hermione. “Back
in Knockturn Alley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend
and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress!”
Harry gaped at her. “I forgot! But this proves Malfoys a Death Eater, how else could he be in
contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?”
“It is pretty suspicious,” breathed Hermione. “Unless…”
“Oh, come on,” said Harry in exasperation, “you can’t get round this one!”
“Well…there is the possibility it was an empty threat.”
“You’re unbelievable, you are,” said Harry, shaking his head. “We’ll see who’s right…You’ll be
eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as
well…”
And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic,
for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year,
they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.
The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had
been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.
APPARITION LESSONS
If you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are
eligible for a twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor.
Please sign below if you would like to participate. Cost: 12 Galleons.
Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to
write their names at the bottom. Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when
Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, “Guess who, Won-
Won?” Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay
behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way
beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word,
Hermione sped up to walk with Neville.
“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention
what had just happened. “Should be a laugh, eh?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “Maybe it’s better when you do it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when
Dumbledore took me along for the ride.”
“I forgot you’d already done it…I’d better pass my test first time,” said Ron, looking anxious.
“Fred and George did.”
“Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?”
“Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me”— Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a
gorilla — “so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much…not to his face anyway…”
“When can we take the actual test?”
“Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me!”
“Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle…”
“Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted.”
Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was
much talk about the forthcoming, lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and
reappear at will.
“How cool will it be when we can just —” Seamus clicked his ringers to indicate disappearance.
“Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I can do it back…He’ll never have another
peaceful moment…”
Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that
instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today’s Charms lesson, he let
out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face.
“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had
dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon
brandishing a stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him. Side-Along-Apparition, you know.”
“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear
what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other
sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off,
when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to
eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library,
so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore.
The lamps in Dumbledore’s office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring
gently in their frames, and the Pen-sieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledore’s hands
lay on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as ever. It did not seem to have
healed at all and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a
distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there
was, in any case, another subject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could say anything about
Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.
“I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s not very happy with me.”
“No,” sighed Dumbledore. “He is not very happy with me either. We must try not to sink
beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.”
Harry grinned.
“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry’s doing a wonderful job.”
Dumbledore smiled.
“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying
desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your
support —”
“After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry angrily. “After Umbridge?”
“I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left office. Within
hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you —”
“So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out. “It was in the Daily Prophet”
“The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,” said Dumbledore, “if only accidentally.
Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.”
“He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore’s man through and through.’”
“How very rude of him.”
“I told him I was.”
Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the
phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry’s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that
Dumbledore’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees. When
Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.
“I am very touched, Harry.”
“Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, still
looking fixedly at his knees.
“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought
it safe to look up again. “He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set
Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again
with the greatest regret.”
“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, hoping for more information on this
intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.
“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press
on, unless there’s anything else —?”
“There is, actually, sir,” said Harry. “It’s about Malfoy and Snape.”
“Professor Snape, Harry.”
“Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorns party…well, I followed them, actually…”
Dumbledore listened to Harry’s story with an impassive face. When Harry had finished he did
not speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that
you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.”
“Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously. “Professor, did you understand -?”
“Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told
me,” said Dumbledore, a little sharply. “I think you might even consider the possibility that I
understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure
you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.”
Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going on? Did this mean that
Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had
already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he
had heard, but pretending not to be?
“So, sir,” said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, “you definitely still trust—?”
“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,” said Dumbledore, but he did not
sound very tolerant anymore. “My answer has not changed.”
“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be
asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.
“And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with
you this evening.”
Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject,
if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry’s mind,
Dumbledore shook his head.
“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that
what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!”
“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir,” said Harry stiffly.
“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said Dumbledore briskly. “I have two more
memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them
is, I think, the most important I have collected.”
Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had
received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.
“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom
Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will
remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to
Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.
“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his
secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin
House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving
his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving.
“How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not
know — perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his
sense of self-importance.
“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in
their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or
aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention
and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet, and
thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.”
“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him at the orphanage?” asked
Harry.
“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for
how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that
chance.”
Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had opened his mouth to speak.
Here, again, was Dumbledore’s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they
did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something…
“But you didn’t really trust him, sir, did you? He told me…the Riddle who came out of that
diary said, ‘Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.’”
“Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,” said Dumbledore. “I had,
as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that
I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure,
that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was careful
never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor
what Mrs. Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he
charmed so many of my colleagues.
“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them
that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no
affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a
motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared
glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of
cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them
became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their
seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never
satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of
Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that
crime.
“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore, placing
his withered hand on the Pensieve. “Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they
are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort,
after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and
questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.
“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This
is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how
he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the
shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of
Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I
believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort,
and began his investigations into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you
will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human
weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew from those who ran the
orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name. Finally, after painstaking research, through old
books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer
of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his
Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand…”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with
swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. “As
you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the
surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed
upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.
It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside
him. The Gaunts’ house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The
ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table
amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet
of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was
slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But
then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right
hand and a short knife in his left.
The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy
Harry recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome — the teenage Voldemort.
Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a
few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at
his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.
“YOU!” he bellowed. “YOU!”
And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft.
“Stop.”
Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to
the floor. He stared at Riddle. There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The
man broke it.
“You speak it?”
“Yes, I speak it,” said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut
behind him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of
fear. His race merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.
“Where is Marvolo?” he asked.
“Dead,” said the other. “Died years ago, didn’t he?”
Riddle frowned.
“Who are you, then?”
“I’m Morfin, ain’t I?”
“Marvolo’s son?”
“‘Course I am, then…”
Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore
Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on his right hand.
“I thought you was that Muggle,” whispered Morfin. “You look mighty like that Muggle.”
“What Muggle?” said Riddle sharply.
“That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way,”
said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. “You look right like him. Riddle.
But he’s older now, in ‘e? He’s older’n you, now I think on it…”
Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching the edge of the table for support.
“He come back, see,” he added stupidly.
Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little
closer and said, “Riddle came back?”
“Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!” said Morfin, spitting on the floor again.
“Robbed us, mind, before she ran off., where’s the locket, eh, where’s Slytherin’s locket?”
Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a rage again; he brandished his
knife and shouted, “Dishonored us, she did, that little slut! And who’re you, coming here and asking
questions about all that? It’s over, innit…It’s over…”
He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural
darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin’s candle, extinguishing everything…
Dumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around Harry’s arm and they were soaring back into the
present again. The soft golden light in Dumbledore’s office seemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that
impenetrable darkness.
“Is that all?” said Harry at once. “Why did it go dark, what happened?”
“Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,” said Dumbledore,
gesturing Harry back into his seat. “When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite
alone. Marvolo’s ring had gone.
“Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street,
screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle
Senior and his mother and father.
“The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how
the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage…The
exception sits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harry’s scar. “The Ministry, on the
other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard’s murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-
hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had already been
imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people.
“So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or
Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know.
He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He
handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. And he
permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight. All that disturbed him was the fact that
his fathers ring had disappeared. ‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his captors over and over again.
‘He’ll kill me for losing his ring.’ And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the
remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last heirloom, and is buried beside
the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.”
“So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Harry, sitting up straight.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be
fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the
valley to ‘the big house over the way.’ There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his
witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the
unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he
returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false
memory in his uncle’s mind, laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient
ring he wore, and departed.”
“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession.”
“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,” said Dumbledore,
“and why should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind when he had already confessed to the
crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I
was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory with
difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin’s release from
Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.”
“But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?” Harry
asked angrily “He was underage at the time, wasn’t he? I thought they could detect underage magic!”
“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that
you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by —”
“Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you’re underage and you do magic
inside an adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t know?”
“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling
slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry’s face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to
enforce their offspring’s obedience while within their walls.”
“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what happened here, look what happened to
Morfin!”
“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed
for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory
before we part…”
Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once,
remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry
noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed
slightly; did memories go bad?
“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial. “We shall be
back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then…”
And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he
recognized at once.
It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight
of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had
his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His
mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as round as the
Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a
fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a
comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a
box of crystalized pineapple.
Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in
Slughorn’s office. Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than
his, and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once. His was the most handsome
face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of
his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s gold-and-black ring; he had already
killed his father.
“Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” he asked.
“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered
finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. “I must say, I’d like to know where
you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.”
Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.
“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the
people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite
—”
As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. The whole room was suddenly
filled with a thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was
standing beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, “You’ll go
wrong, boy, mark my words.”
The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did
anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a
small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock.
“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn. “You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all
be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”
Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the
boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately,
wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.
“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. “You don’t
want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect…”
“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.”
“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away…”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about…about Horcruxes?”
And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see
Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice
boomed out again, just as it had done before.
“I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once
and don’t let me catch you mentioning them again!”
“Well, that’s that,” said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry. “Time to go.”
And Harry’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the rug in front of Dumbledore’s
desk.
“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly.
Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what
was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it,
was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a
question and failed to get an answer.
“As you might have noticed,” said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, “that memory
has been tampered with.”
“Tampered with?” repeated Harry, sitting back down too.
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections.”
“But why would he do that?”
“Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,” said Dumbledore. “He has tried to
rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish
me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows
that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.
“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be your job to persuade
Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of
information of all.”
Harry stared at him.
“But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, “you don’t need me — you
could use Legilimency…or Veritaserum…”
“Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,” said Dumbledore.
“He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be
astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into
giving me this travesty of a recollection.
“No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force,
and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has
his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to
penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry…How
important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck…and good night.”
A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly. “Good night, sir.”
As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see
why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.”
“I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical
cry.
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
The next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him,
though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron’s presence longer than it took to give
him a contemptuous look.
Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.
“He loves you,” he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. “Won’t refuse you
anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask
him.”
Hermione, however, took a gloomier view.
“He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn’t get it out of
him,” she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break.
“Horcruxes…Horcruxes…I’ve never even heard of them…”
“You haven’t?”
Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as
to what Horcruxes were.
“They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know
about them? I think it’s going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you’ll have to be very
careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy…”
“Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon…”
“Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you’d better do it,” she said, flaring up at once. “After all,
when has Won-Won’s judgement ever been faulty?”
“Hermione, can’t you —”
“No!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow.
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had
to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to
Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron.
“What’ve you done?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione’s haughty profile.
But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room.
“Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon!
Golpalott’s Third Law…who can tell me —? But Miss Granger can, of course!”
Hermione recited at top speed: “Golpalott’s-Third-Law- states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-
poison-will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate- components.”
“Precisely!” beamed Slughorn. “Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott’s Third
Law as true…”
Harry was going to have to take Slughorn’s word for it that Golpalott’s Third Law was true,
because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what
Slughorn said next, either.
“…which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion’s
ingredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting
antidotes to those ingredients in a of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by
an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements —”
Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open, doodling absently on his new copy of
Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him
out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.
“…and so,” finished Slughorn, “I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from
my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good
luck, and don’t forget your protective gloves!”
Hermione had left her stool and was halfway towards Siughorn’s desk before the rest of the class
had realized it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron and Ernie returned to the table, she
had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.
“It’s a shame that the Prince won’t be able to help you much with this, Harry,” she said brightly
as she straightened up. “You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or
cheats!”
Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Sliughorn’s desk, which was a garish
shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest
idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking
rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.
“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” Ron muttered to Harry.
Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on
Antidotes. There was Golpalott’s Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but
not a single illuminating note in the Prince’s hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince,
like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.
“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.
Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they
could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incantations that
she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, “Specialis
revelio!” over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.
It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class
was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of
the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head
hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione’s expression could not have
been any smugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class. She was now
decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More
to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince’s
book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.
And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes.
Just shove a bezoar down their throats.
Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn’t he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn’t
Snape mentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? “A stone taken from the stomach of a goat,
which will protect from most poisons.”
It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry
would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the
store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs
until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word Bezoars.
He opened the box just as Slughorn called, “Two minutes left, everyone!” Inside were half a
dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized
one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.
“Time’s…UP!” called Slughorn genially. “Well, let’s see how you’ve done! Blaise…what have
you got for me?”
Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had
finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle
before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid
breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar
clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.
Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie’s potion and passed on to Ron’s with a
grimace. He did not linger over Ron’s cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.
“And you, Harry,” he said. “What have you got to show me?”
Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.
Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he
was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.
“You’ve got a nerve, boy!” he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could
see it. “Oh, you’re like your mother…well, I can’t fault you…a bezoar would certainly act as an
antidote to all these potions!”
Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished
antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly
behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.
“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?” she asked through gritted teeth.
“That’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!” said Slughorn happily, before Harry
could reply. “Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s
undoubtedly from Lily he gets it…yes, Harry, yes, if you’ve got a bezoar to hand, of course that
would do the trick…although as they don’t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it’s still worth
knowing how to mix antidotes…”
The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was
pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them
could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the
bell rang.
“Time to pack up!” said Slughorn. “And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!” Still
chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.
Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor
Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn
were the only two left in the room.
“Come on, now, Harry, you’ll be late for your next lesson,” said Slughorn affably, snapping the
gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase.
“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, “I wanted to ask you something.”
“Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away…”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about…about Horcruxes?”
Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely,
“What did you say?”
“I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see — “
“Dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered Slughorn.
His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He
fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow.
“Dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory,” said Slughorn. “Well? Hasn’t he?”
“Yes,” said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.
“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. “Of course…well, if
you’ve seen that memory, Harry, you’ll know that I don’t know anything — anything” — he
repeated the word forcefully — “about Horcruxes.”
He seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to
the dungeon door.
“Sir,” said Harry desperately, “I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory -”
“Did you?” said Slughorn. “Then you were wrong, weren’t you? WRONG!”
He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon
door behind him.
Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous
interview. Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work
properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar, too.
“It would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it!” said Harry irritably. “Look, I had to try
and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn’t I? Oh, will you get a grip!” he added
in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name.
Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione’s attitudes, Harry brooded for the next few
days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let
Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false
sense of security before returning to the attack.
When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual
affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an
invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to
reschedule Quidditch practice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked
with Hermione and Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew,
had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite
as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question
him.
Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first lime in living memory. She
was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar,
“I haven’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!” she told him. “Not a single one!
I’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell
you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduciion
to Magick Mostc Evile — listen — ‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not
speak nor give direction’…I mean, why mention it, then?” she said impatiently, slamming the old
book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. “Oh, shut up,” she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag.
The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness.
Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns
slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years’ first Apparition lesson, which was
scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the
Great Hall instead of in the grounds.
When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found
that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling
swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and
Sprout — the Heads of House — and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition
Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an
insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether
constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this
frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.
“Good morning,” said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of
House had called for quiet. “My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition
Instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this
time —”
“Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor McGonagall.
Everybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away
from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced
quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less
because of Malfoy’s rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house.
“— by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,” Twycross continued, as though
there had been no interruption.
“As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The
Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable
you to practice. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall,
and that you would be unwise to try.
“I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in
front of you.”
There was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and
ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them
into position and breaking up arguments.
“Harry, where are you going?” demanded Hermione.
But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where
Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted
to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by
dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd,
directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument
with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.
“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing
right behind him. “It’s taking longer than I thought it would.”
Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say.
“Look, it’s none of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you’re told
and keep a lookout!”
“I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,” Harry said, just loud
enough for Malfoy to hear him.
Malfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at that precise moment the four
Heads of House shouted, “Quiet!” and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front.
“Thank you,” said Twycross. “Now then…”
He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of
every student.
“The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D’s!” said Twycross.
“Destination, Determination, Deliberation!
“Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,” said Twycross. “In this case, the
interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.”
Everybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then
hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop
and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn’t stop puzzling over
what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts.
“Step two,” said Twycross, “focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your
yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body! “
Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was
contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining
to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.
“Step three,” called Twycross, “only when I give the command…turn on the spot, feeling your
way into nothingness, moving with deliberation. On my command, now…one —”
Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to
Apparate so quickly.
“— two — ”
Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three D’s
stood for.
“— THREE!”
Harry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The
whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on
the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled,
until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him.
“Never mind, never mind,” said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything
better. “Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions…”
The second atlempt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth
did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around,
terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five
feet away where she had started.
The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke,
which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified.
“Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,” said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately,
“occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your
destination, and move, without haste, but with deliberation…thus.”
Twycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and
vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. “Remember the three D’s,” he said,
“and try again…one — two — three”
But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened.
Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, “Until next
Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destination. Determination. Deliberation.”
With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by
Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall.
“How did you do?” asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. “I think I felt something the last time I
tried — a kind of tingling in my feet.”
“I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,” said a voice behind them, and Hermione
stalked past, smirking.
“I didn’t feel anything,” said Harry, ignoring this interruption. “But I don’t care about that
now-”
“What d’you mean, you don’t care…don’t you want to learn to Apparate?” said Ron
incredulously.
“I’m not fussed, really. I prefer flying,” said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where
Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. “Look, hurry up, will you, there’s
something I want to do…”
Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily
detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone
pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of
their trusted shortcuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.
“Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?” asked Ron, panting slightly.
“Up here,” said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to
the boys’ staircase.
Their dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to
rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.
“Harry…”
“Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. I want to
know…aha.”
He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out
and tapped with the tip of his wand. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good…or Malfoy is.”
At once, the Marauder’s Map appeared on the parchment’s surface. Here was a detailed plan of
every one of the castle’s floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each
of the castle’s occupants.
“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently.
He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.
“There!” said Ron, after a minute or so. “He’s in the Slytherin common room, look…with
Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle…”
Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.
“Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now on,” he said firmly. “And the moment I see him
lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old
Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he’s —”
He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed
material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of
weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to
the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious.
Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than
usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only
nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry
toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how
he could be doing it, given the very high level of security now operating within the castle. He could
only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As
for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were
usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older — Ron and Hermione, Harry
reflected sadly, were living proof.
February moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as
well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common-room noticeboards that the next
trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious.
“It was on my birthday!” he said, “I was looking forward to that!”
“Not a big surprise, though, is it?” said Harry. “Not after what happened to Katie.”
She had still not returned from St. Mungo’s. What was more, further disappearances had been
reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.
“But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!” said Ron grumpily. “Big birthday
treat…”
Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had
managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-
feeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three D’s, which had inspired a number of nicknames for
him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head.
“Happy birthday, Ron,” said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and
Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. “Have a present.”
He threw the package across on to Ron’s bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must,
Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.
“Cheers,” said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his
own trunk and began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map, which he hid after every use. He
turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in
which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.
“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly and murmuring, “I
solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the
time, would not hear.
“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves
Harry had given him.
“No problem,” said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for
Malfoy. “Hey…I don’t think he’s in his bed…”
Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an
exclamation of pleasure.
“Seriously good haul this year!” he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols
around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. “See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I
think I’ll come of age next year too…”
“Cool,” muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map.
Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating
breakfast…he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study…he wasn’t in any of the
bathrooms or in the hospital wing…
“Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.
“No thanks,” said Harry, looking up. “Malfoy’s gone again!”
“Can’t have done,” said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to
get dressed. “Come on if you don’t hurry up you’ll have to Apparate on an empty-stomach…might
make it easier, I suppose…”
Ron looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself
to a third.
Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, “Mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been,
and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy’s periodic disappearances,
but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him,
but even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice,
homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence
being remarked upon,
“Ready?” he said to Ron.
He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that Ron had not moved, but was
leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un-focused look on
his face.
“Ron? Breakfast.”
“I’m not hungry.”
Harry stared ai him.
“I thought you just said —?”
“Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, “but I don’t want to eat.”
Harry scrutinised him suspiciously.
“You’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven’t you?”
“It’s not that,” Ron sighed again. “You…you wouldn’t understand.”
“Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.
“Harry!” said Ron suddenly.
“What?”
“Harry, I can’t stand it!”
“You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale
and looked as though he was about to be sick.
“I can’t stop thinking about her!” said Ron hoarsely.
Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends
they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender “Lav-Lav”, he would have to put his foot down.
“Why does that stop you having breakfast?” Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common
sense into the proceedings.
“I don’t think she knows I exist,” said Ron with a desperate gesture.
“She definitely knows you exist,” said Harry, bewildered. “She keeps snogging you, doesn’t she?”
Ron blinked.
“Who are you talking about?”
“Who are you talking about?” said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped
out of the conversation.
“Romilda Vane,” said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though
hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry
said, “This is a joke, right? You’re joking.”
“I think…Harry, I think I love her,” said Ron in a strangled voice.
“Okay,” said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid
complexion, “Okay…say that again with a straight face.”
“I love her,” repeated Ron breathlessly. “Have you seen her hair, it’s all black and shiny and
silky…and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her “
“This is really funny and everything,” said Harry impatiently, “but joke’s over, all right? Drop
it.”
He turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the
right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron’s fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with
rage; he was about to strike again.
Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind
without conscious thought: Levicorpus!
Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his
robes hanging off him.
“What was that for?” Harry bellowed.
“You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!” shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple
in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.
“This is insane!” said Harry. “What’s got into —?”
And then he saw the box lying open on Ron’s bed and the truth hit him with the force of a
stampeding troll.
“Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?”
“They were a birthday present!” shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get
free. “I offered you one, didn’t I?”
“You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you?”
“They’d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!”
“They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand? They were mine, I chucked them
out of my trunk when I was looking for the map. They’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave
me before Christmas and they’re all spiked with love potion!”
But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.
“Romilda?” he repeated. “Did you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce
me?”
Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a
strong desire to laugh. A part of him — the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen
on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore
off…but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he
had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to
declare undying love for Romilda Vane.
“Yeah, I’ll introduce you,” said Harry, thinking fast. “I’m going to let you down now, okay?”
He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to
his feet again, grinning.
“She’ll be in Slughorn’s office,” said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door.
“Why will she be in there?” asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.
“Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,” said Harry, inventing wildly.
“Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?” said Ron eagerly.
“Great idea,” said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry
had not foreseen.
“You’re late, Won-Won!” she pouted. “I’ve got you a birthday —”
“Leave me alone,” said Ron impatiently, “Harry’s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.”
And without another word to her, he pushed his way out of the portrait hole. Harry tried to
make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she
looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.
Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office
door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing-gown and matching nightcap and looking
rather bleary-eyed.
“Harry,” he mumbled. “This is very early for a call…I generally sleep late on a Saturday…”
“Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you,” said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on
tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, “but my friend Ron’s swallowed a love potion
by mistake. You couldn’t make him an antidote, could you? I’d take him to Madam Pomfrey, but
we’re not supposed to have anything from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and, you know…awkward
questions…”
“I’d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like
you?” asked Slughorn.
“Er,” said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in
an attempt to force his way into the room, “well, I’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir,
and by the time I get it right Ron might’ve done something serious “
Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, “I can’t see her. Harry — is he hiding her?”
“Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest.
“They can strengthen, you know, the longer they’re kept.”
“That would explain a lot,” panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from
knocking Slughorn over. “It’s his birthday, Professor,” he added imploringly.
“Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,” said Slughorn, relenting. “I’ve got the necessary here in
my bag, it’s not a difficult antidote…”
Ron burst through the door into Slughorn’s overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled
footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered, “She didn’t see that,
did she?”
“She’s not here yet,” said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few
pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.
“That’s good,” said Ron fervently. “How do I look?”
“Very handsome,” said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. “Now drink that
up, it’s a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know,”
“Brilliant,” said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.
Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his
grin sagged and vanished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.
“Back to normal, then?” said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. “Thanks a lot, Professor.”
“Don’t mention it, m’boy, don’t mention it,” said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby
armchair, looking devastated. “Pick-me-up, that’s what he needs,” Slughorn continued, now-
bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. “I’ve got butterbeer, I’ve got wine, I’ve got one last bottle
of this oak-matured mead…hmm…meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas…ah well…”
he shrugged “…he can’t miss what he’s never had! Why don’t we open it now and celebrate Mr.
Weasley’s birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love…”
He chortled again and Harry joined in. This was the first time he had found himself almost
alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps,
if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood…perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-
matured mead…
“There you are, then,” said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each, before
raising his own. “Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph —”
“— Ron —” whispered Harry.
But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his
mouth and swallowed it.
There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something
terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not.
“— and may you have many more —”
“Ron!”
Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking
uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.
“Professor!” Harry bellowed. “Do something!”
But Slughorn seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue.
“What — but —” spluttered Slughorn.
Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughorn’s open potion kit, pulling out jars
and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron’s gargling breath filled the room. Then he found it -
the shrivelled kidney-like stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions.
He hurtled back to Ron’s side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron
gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still.
CHAPTER NINETEEN
ELF TAILS
“So, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays?” said Fred.
It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit. Ron’s was the
only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day
waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. Madam
Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o’clock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past.
“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our present,” said George grimly, putting down a
large wrapped gift on Ron’s bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny.
“Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,” said Fred.
“There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him —” said George.
“You were in Hogsmeade?” asked Ginny, looking up.
“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred gloomily. “A Hogsmeade branch, you know,
but a fat lot of good it’ll do us if you lot aren’t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff
anymore…But never mind that now.”
He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron’s pale face.
“How exactly did it happen, Harry?”
Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore, to
McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny.
“…and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for
help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon
he’ll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says he’ll have to stay here a week or so…keep taking essence of
rue…”
“Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,” said George in a low voice.
“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Harry, who kept turning cold at the thought of what
would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone.
Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having
hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had
happened., she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny’s obsessive discussion about how Ron
had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until ai last
they had been allowed in to see him.
“Do Mum and Dad know?” Fred asked Ginny.
“They’ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago — they’re in Dumbledore’s office now, but
they’ll be back soon…”
There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep.
“So the poison was in the drink?” said Fred quietly.
“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to
start discussing it again. “Slughorn poured it out —”
“Would he have been able to slip something into Ron’s glass without you seeing?”
“Probably,” said Harry, “but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron?”
“No idea,” said Fred, frowning. “You don’t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake?
Meaning to get you?”
“Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?” asked Ginny.
“I dunno,” said Fred, “but there must be loads of people who’d like to poison Harry, mustn’t
there? ‘The Chosen One’ and all that?”
“So you think Slughorn’s a Death Eater?” said Ginny.
“Anything’s possible,” said Fred darkly.
“He could be under the Imperius Curse,” said George.
“Or he could be innocent,” said Ginny. “The poison could have been in the bottle, in which case
it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.”
“Who’d want to kill Slughorn?”
“Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side,” said Harry. “Slughorn was in
hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And…” He thought of the memory Dumbledore had
not yet been able to extract from Slughorn. “And maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way,
maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore.”
“But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas,”
Ginny reminded him. “So the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore.”
“Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,” said Hermione, speaking for the first time
in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. “Anyone who knew Slughorn would have
known there was a good chance he’d keep something that tasty for himself.”
“Er-my-nee,” croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them
They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment
he merely started snoring.
The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his
hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of
muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor.
“Bin in the forest all day!” he panted. “Aragog’s worse, I bin readin’ to him — didn’ get up ter
dinner till jus’ now an’ then Professor Sprout told me abou’ Ron! How is he?”
“Not bad,” said Harry. “They say he’ll be okay.”
“No more than six visitors at a time!” said Madam Pomfrey, hurrying out of her office.
“Hagrid makes six,” George pointed out.
“Oh…yes…” said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people
due to his vastness. To cover her confusion, she hurried off to clear up his muddy foot prints with
her wand.
“I don’ believe this,” said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at
Ron. “Jus’ don’ believe it…Look at him lyin’ there…Who’d want ter hurt him, eh?”
“That’s just what we were discussing,” said Harry. “We don’t know.”
“Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryfinndor Quidditch team, could they?” said
Hagrid anxiously. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron…”
“I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,” said George.
“Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it,” said Fred fairly.
“Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a connection between the attacks,” said
Hermione quietly
“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred.
“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren’t, although that was pure
luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who
was supposed to be killed. Of course,” she added broodingly, “that makes the person behind this
even more dangerous in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many people they finish off
before they actually reach their victim.”
Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, the dormitory doors opened
again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward. They had done no more than satisfy
themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley
seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tighty.
“Dumbledore’s told us how you saved him with the bezoar,” she sobbed. “Oh, Harry, what can
we say? You saved Ginny…you saved Arthur…now you’ve saved Ron
“Don’t be…I didn’t…” muttered Harry awkwardly.
“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,” Mr. Weasley
said in a constricted voice. “Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron
decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express Harry.”
Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded
them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ron’s bed; he and Hermione rose at
once to leave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.
“It’s terrible,” growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three of them walked back along the
corridor to the marble staircase. “All this new security, an kids are still gettin’ hurt…Dumbledore’s
worried sick…He don’ say much, but I can tell…”
“Hasn’t he got any ideas, Hagrid?” asked Hermione desperately.
“I spect he’s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,” said Hagrid. “But he doesn’ know who sent
that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they’dve bin caught, wouldn they? Wha’ worries me,”
said Hagrid, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure, checked
the ceiling for Peeves), “is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein’ attacked. Chamber o’
Secrets all over again, isn’ it? There’ll be panic, more parents takin their kids outta school, an nex’
thing yeh know the board o’ governors…”
Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired woman drifted serenely past, then resumed
in a hoarse whisper, “…the board o’ governors’ll be talkin about shuttin’ us up fer good.”
“Surely not?” said Hermione, looking worried.
“Gotta see it from their point o’ view,” said Hagrid heavily. “I mean, it’s always bin a bit of a risk
sendin a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it? Yer expect accidents, don’ yeh, wit hundreds of underage wizards
all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha’s diff’rent. ‘S’no wonder Dumbledore’s angry
with Sn —”
Hagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above
his tangled black beard.
“What?” said Harry quickly. “Dumbledore’s angry with Snape?”
“I never said tha’,” said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway.
“Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter —”
“Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?” Harry asked loudly.
“Shhhh!” said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. “Don’ shout stuff like that, Harry, d’yeh
wan’ me ter lose me job? Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d care, would yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care
of Mag —”
“Don’t try and make me feel guilty, it wont work!” said Harry forcefully. “What’s Snape done?”
“I dunno, Harry, I shouldn’ta heard it at all! I — well, I was comin’ outta the forest the other
evenin’ an’ I overheard ‘em talking — well, arguin’. Didn’t like ter draw attention to meself, so I
sorta skulked an’ tried not ter listen, but it was a — well, a heated discussion an’ it wasn’ easy ter
block it out.”
“Well?” Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.
“Well — I jus’ heard Snape sayin’ Dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he —
Snape — didn’ wan’ ter do it anymore —”
“Do what?”
“I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin’ a bit overworked, tha’s all — anyway,
Dumbledore told him flat out he’d agreed ter do it an’ that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with
him. An’ then he said summat abou’ Snape makin’ investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well,
there’s nothin’ strange abou’ that!” Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks
full of meaning. “All the Heads o’ Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business —”
“Yeah, but Dumbledore’s not having rows with the rest of them, is he?” said Harry.
“Look,” Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering
sound and it snapped in two. “I know what yeh’re like abou’ Snape, Harry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter
go readin’ more inter this than there is.”
“Look out,” said Hermione tersely.
They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them
before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.
“Oho!” he wheezed. “Out of bed so late, this’ll mean detention!”
“No it won’, Filch,” said Hagrid shortly. “They’re with me, aren’ they?”
“And what difference does that make?” asked Filch obnoxiously.
“I’m a ruddy teacher, aren’ I, yeh sneakin’ Squib!” said Hagrid, firing up at once.
There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and
was twisting herself sinuously around Filch’s skinny ankles.
“Get goin,” said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.
Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagrid’s and Filch’s raised
voices echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower,
but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,
When there’s strife and when there’s trouble
Call on Peevsie, he’ll make double!
The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow
them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people
knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione
bade him good night and set off for the girls’ dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a
seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.
So Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his
insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him…He did not think that
Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins…or, perhaps, to investigate a single
Slytherin: Malfoy?
Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his
own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry’s suspicions? That seemed likely. It
might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from
procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide
suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds…
“There you are, Potter!”
Harry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the
common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out
of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.
“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said McLaggen, disregarding Harry’s drawn wand.
“Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look
like he’ll be fit for next week’s match.”
It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.
“Oh…right…Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running
a hand wearily through his hair. “Yeah…he might not make it.”
“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said McLaggen.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so…”
He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed
second-best in the trials.
“Excellent,” said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. “So when’s practice?”
“What? Oh…there’s one tomorrow evening.”
“Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I’ve got some ideas on strategy you
might find useful.”
“Right,” said Harry unenthusiastically. “Well, I’ll hear them tomorrow, then. I’m pretty tired
now…see you…”
The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation
that Katie’s attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that
he had been in the Potions master’s room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote
immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more
interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see
Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary
during the opening match against Slytherin.
Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed
with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder’s Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes
made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out
of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the
map…
But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with Quidditch practice,
homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and
Lavender Brown.
He could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of
hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that
Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he
was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that
more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain.
Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which Harry found almost more
wearing than McLaggen’s Quidditch lectures. At first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody
had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing — “I mean, I am his girlfriend!”— but
unfortunately she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots
of in-depth chats with him about Ron’s feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would
have happily forgone.
“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” Harry asked, after a particularly long
interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her
new drew robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender
to be “serious.”
“Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said Lavender fretfully.
“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to
the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snape’s row and keen
abuse McLaggen as much as possible.
“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender demanded suddenly.
“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Harry uncomfortably.
“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Lavender scornfully. “She didn’t talk to him for weeks after
he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he’s all
interesting…”
“Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” asked Harry. “Anyway — sorry, got to go
— there’s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,” said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed
sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take
him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him.
On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry dropped in on the hospital
wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him
go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him.
“So how’s McLaggen shaping up?” he asked Harry nervously, apparently forgetting that he had
already asked the same question twice.
“I’ve told you,” said Harry patiently, “he could be world-class and I wouldn’t want to keep him.
He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the
rest of us. I can’t wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people,” Harry added,
getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, “will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender
comes to see you? She’s driving me mad as well.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking sheepish. “Yeah. All right.”
“If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,” said Harry.
“Yeah…well…it’s not that easy, is it?” said Ron. He paused. “Hermione going to look in before
the match?” he added casually.
“No, she’s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking rather glum. “Right. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag— I
mean, Smith.”
“I’ll try,” said Harry, shouldering his broom. “See you after the match.”
He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was outside, either already
seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. He was looking out of the windows he passed,
trying to gauge how much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he
saw Malfoy walking toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and
resentful.
Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short, humorless laugh and continued
walking.
“Where’re you going?” Harry demanded.
“Yeah, I’m really going to tell you, because it’s your business, Potter,” sneered Malfoy. “You’d
better hurry up, they’ll be waiting for ‘the Chosen Captain’ — ‘the Boy Who Scored’ — whatever
they call you these days.”
One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her. She blushed. Malfoy pushed past
Harry and she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.
Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. This was infuriating; he was
already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the
rest of the school was absent: Harry’s best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to. The
silent seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where
Malfoy had vanished…
“Where have you been?” demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted into the changing rooms. The
whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs
nervously against their legs.
“I met Malfoy,” Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head. “So I wanted
to know how come he’s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down
here…”
“Does it matter right now?”
“Well, I’m not likely to find out, am I?” said Harry, seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses
straight. “Come on then!”
And without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos.
There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there were dazzling flashes of
bright sunlight.
“Tricky conditions!” McLaggen said bracingly to the team. “Coote, Peakes, you’ll want to fly out
of the sun, so they don’t see you coming —”
“I’m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions,” said Harry angrily. “Just get up
by the goal posts!”
Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.
“Make sure you do fly out of the sun,” he told them grudgingly.
He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hooch’s whistle, kicked off
and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the
Snitch. If he could catch it good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the
castle, seize the Marauder’s Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing…
“And that’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,” said a dreamy voice, echoing over the
grounds. “He did the commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think
probably on purpose, it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he
regrets that now he’s playing them — oh, look, he’s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I do
like her, she’s very nice…”
Harry stared down at the commentator’s podium. Surely nobody in their right mind would have
let Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long, dirty-
blonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks…Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking
slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment.
“…but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the Quaffle from her, I can’t remember his name,
it’s something like Bibble — no, Buggins —”
“It’s Cadwallader!” said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna. The crowd laughed.
Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored.
McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with
the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.
“McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else
alone!” bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper.
“You’re not setting a great example!” McLaggen shouted back, red-faced and furious.
“And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his Keeper,” said Luna serenely, while both
Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. “I don’t think that’ll help him
find the Snitch, but maybe it’s a clever ruse…”
Swearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for
some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.
Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below
something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not
seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and
kept attempting to draw the crowd’s attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the
possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for
longer than a minute, was suffering from something called “Loser’s Lurgy.”
“Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!” barked Professor McGonagall into Luna’s megaphone.
“Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely. “Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper’s got hold of one of the
Beater’s bats.”
Harry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had
pulled Peakes’s bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an
oncoming Cadwallader.
“Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!” roared Harry, pelting toward
McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.
A blinding, sickening pain…a flash of light…distant screams…and the sensation of falling down
a long tunnel…
And the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and
looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his
head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.
“Nice of you to drop in,” said Ron, grinning.
Harry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was
indigo streaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago…as had any hope of
cornering Malfoy. Harry’s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of
bandages.
“What happened?”
“Cracked skull,” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows.
“Nothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I’m keeping you in overnight. You shouldn’t over
exert yourself for a few hours.”
“I don’t want to stay here overnight,” said Harry angrily, sitting up and throwing back his
covers. “I want to find McLaggen and kill him.”
“I’m afraid that would come under the heading of ‘overexertion,’” said Madam Pomfrey,
pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. “You will stay
here until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.”
She bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.
“D’you know how much we lost by?” he asked Ron through clenched teeth.
“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apologetically. “Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty.”
“Brilliant,” said Harry savagely. “Really brilliant! When I get hold of McLaggen —”
“You don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a troll,” said Ron reasonably. “Personally, I
think there’s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest
of the team might’ve dealt with him before you get out of here, they’re not happy…”
There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short
of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly. Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light
on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender
underneath all the bandaging.
“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter.
“I hope Luna always commentates from now on…Loser’s Lurgy…”
But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and after a while Ron’s snorts
subsided.
“Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said, after a long pause, and Harry’s
imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his
lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his
blessing…”She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early
enough.”
“Oh…” said Harry, as the scene in his mind’s eye imploded. “Yeah…well, I saw Malfoy
sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted to be with him, and that’s the
second time he’s made sure he isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he
skipped the last match too, remember?” Harry sighed. “Wish I’d followed him now, the match was
such a fiasco…”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron sharply. “You couldn’t have missed a Quidditch match just to
follow Malfoy, you’re the Captain!”
“I want to know what he’s up to,” said Harry. “And don’t tell me its all in my head, not after
what I overheard between him and Snape —”
“I never said it was all in your head,” said Ron, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and
frowning at Harry, “but there’s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in
this place! You’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match
just to follow him…”
“I want to catch him at it!” said Harry in frustration. “I mean, where’s he going when he
disappears off the map?”
“I dunno…Hogsmeade?” suggested Ron, yawning.
“I’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map. I thought they were
being watched now anyway?”
“Well then, I dunno,” said Ron.
Silence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamp light above him, thinking…
If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would have been able to set a tail upon Malfoy, but
unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of Aurors at his command…He thought fleetingly of
trying to set something up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be
missed from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules…
There was a low, rumbling snore from Ron’s bed. After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her
office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto
his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps
dimmed, and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was
off to bed.
This was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been brought to the hospital
wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of
dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm
by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart…That had been his most painful injury by far…he
remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the
arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the —
Harry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He had the solution at
last: There was a way to have Malfoy followed — how could he have forgotten, why hadn’t he
thought of it before?
But the question was, how to call him? What did you do? Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into
the darkness.
“Kreacher?”
There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron
awoke with a yelp.
“What’s going —?”
Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey’s office and muttered,
“Muffliato!” so that she would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a
better look at what was going on.
Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a
shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like
a loincloth. Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above
the wrestling elves.
“I was watching that, Potty!” he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before
letting out a loud cackle. “Look at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy—”
“Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won’t, or Dobby will shut
Kreacher’s mouth for him!” cried Dobby in a high-pitched voice.
“— kicky, scratchy!” cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of’ chalk at the elves to enrage them
further. “Tweaky, pokey!”
“Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of
Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher’s mistress say —?”
Exactly what Kreacher’s mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment
Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacher’s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry
and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try
and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, “Stick
your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies —”
Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlock!” Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then
swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his
tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.
“Nice one,” said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer
made contact with Kreacher. “That was another Prince hex, wasn’t it?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, twisting Kreacher’s wizened arm into a half nelson. “Right — I’m forbidding
you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you’re forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I’m not
allowed to give you orders —”
“Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry
Potter wants him to do!” said Dobby, tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his
jumper.
“Okay then,” said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did
not continue fighting.
“Master called me?” croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that
plainly wished him a painful death.
“Yeah, I did,” said Harry, glancing toward Madam Pomfrey’s office door to check that the
Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. “I’ve
got a job for you.”
“Kreacher will do whatever Master wants,” said Kreacher, sinking so low that his lips almost
touched his gnarled toes, “because Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a
master, yes —”
“Dobby will do it, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, his tennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming in
tears. “Dobby would be honored to help Harry Potter!”
“Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,” said Harry. “Okay then…I want
you to tail Draco Malfoy.”
Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron’s face, Harry went on, “I want to
know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what he’s doing. I want you to follow him around
the clock.”
“Yes, Harry Potter!” said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with excitement. “And if Dobby
does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry Potter!”
“There won’t be any need for that,” said Harry hastily.
“Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?” croaked Kreacher. “Master wants me
to spy upon the pureblood great-nephew of my old mistress?”
“That’s the one,” said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it
immediately. “And you’re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what you’re up to, or
to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or…or to contact him in any way. Got it?”
He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just
been given and waited. After a moment or two, and to Harry’s great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed
deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, “Master thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey
him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy, oh yes…”
“That’s settled, then,” said Harry. “I’ll want regular reports, but make sure I’m not surrounded
by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And don’t tell anyone what you’re doing.
Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters.”
CHAPTER TWENTY
LORD VOLDEMORT’S REQUEST
Harry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by
the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out
and poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione even
escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean. The
drowsing creature in Harry’s chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.
“What did they row about?” he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor
corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in
tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass
scales she was carrying.
“It’s all right!” said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her. “Here…”
She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, “Reparo.” The girl did not say thank you,
but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at
her.
“I swear they’re getting smaller,” he said.
“Never mind her,” said Harry, a little impatiently. “What did Ginny and Dean row about,
Hermione?”
“Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you,” said Hermione
“It must’ve looked funny,” said Ron reasonably
“It didn’t look funny at all!” said Hermione hotly, “It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes
hadn’t caught Harry he could have been badly hurt!”
“Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,” said Harry, still trying to
sound casual. “Or are they still together?”
“Yes, they are — but why are you so interested?” asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look.
“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up again!” he said hastily, but Hermione
continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, “Harry!”
giving him an excuse to turn his back on her.
“Oh, hi, Luna.”
“I went to the hospital wing to find you,” said Luna, rummaging in her bag. “But they said
you’d left…”
She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable
amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron’s hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of
parchment that she handed to Harry.
“…I’ve been told to give you this.”
It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson
with Dumbledore.
“Tonight,” he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it.
“Nice commentary last match!” said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the
toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.
“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” she said. “Everyone says I was dreadful.”
“No, I’m serious!” said Ron earnestly. “I can’t remember enjoying commentary more! What is
this, by the way?” he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level.
“Oh, it’s a Gurdyroot,” she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. “You
can keep it if you like, I’ve got a few of them. They’re really excellent for warding off Gulping
Plimpies.” And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.
“You know, she’s grown on me, Luna,” he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. “I know
she’s insane, but it’s in a good —” He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing
at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous.
“Hi,” said Ron nervously.
“C’mon,” Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard
Lavender say, “Why didn’t you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?”
Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and
though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were
together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice
Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good
mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words,
finish writing) Harry’s Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this
point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work.
“Thanks a lot, Hermione,” said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his
watch and saw that it was nearly eight o’clock. “Listen, I’ve got to hurry or I’ll be late for
Dumbledore…”
She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way.
Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmaster’s office. The
gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a
time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.
“Enter,” called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched
open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney.
“Aha!” she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying
spectacles. “So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office,
Dumbledore!”
“My dear Sybill,” said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, “there is no question of
throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really
don’t think there is any more to be said —”
“Very well,” said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. “If you will not banish the
usurping nag, so be it…Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated…”
She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway
down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls.
“Please close the door and sit down, Harry,” said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired.
Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore’s desk that the Pensieve
lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.
“Professor Trelawney still isn’t happy Firenze is teaching, then?” Harry asked.
“No,” said Dumbledore, “Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have
foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where
he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of
the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know — and I think it would be unwise
to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.”
Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, “But never mind my staffing problems. We have
much more important matters to discuss. Firstly — have you managed the task I set you at the end
of our previous lesson?”
“Ah,” said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron
being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy
was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract
from Professor Slughorn. “Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but,
er, he wouldn’t give it to me.” There was a little silence.
“I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles
and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. “And you feel that you have exerted
your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable
ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the
memory?”
“Well,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the
memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. “Well…the day Ron swallowed love potion by
mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good
enough mood —”
“And did that work?” asked Dumbledore.
“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned —”
“— which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have
expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley
was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set
you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to
impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time
without it.”
A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry’s head all the way down his body.
Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred
him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.
“Sir,” he said, a little desperately, “it isn’t that I wasn’t bothered or anything, I’ve just had other
— other things…”
“Other things on your mind,” Dumbledore finished the sentence for him. “I see.”
Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced
with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the
portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore’s head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he
had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said,
“Professor Dumbledore, I’m really sorry. I should have done more…I should have realized you
wouldn’t have asked me to do it if it wasn’t really important.”
“Thank you for saying that, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “May I hope, then, that you will
give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight
unless we have that memory.”
“I’ll do it, sir, I’ll get it from him,” he said earnestly.
“Then we shall say no more about it just now,” said Dumbledore more kindly, “but continue
with our story where we left off. You remember where that was?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry quickly. “Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it
look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked…he asked
Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes,” he mumbled shamefacedly.
“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Now, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very
outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my
deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?”
Harry nodded.
“But now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “now things become murkier and stranger. If it was
difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone
prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart
from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have
two last memories that I would like to share with you.” Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal
bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. “I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the
conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.”
The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply
ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in
his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.
“I hope you are not tired of diving into other people’s memories, for they are curious
recollections, these two,” he said. “This first one came from a very old house-elf by the name of
Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left
Hogwarts.
“He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in
every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were
to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom
Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that
several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic,
offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The
next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.”
“At Borgin and Burkes?” Harry repeated, stunned.
“At Borgin and Burkes,” repeated Dumbledore calmly. “I think you will see what attractions the
place held for him when we have entered Hokey’s memory. But this was not Voldemort’s first choice
of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time — I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster
confided — but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at
Hogwarts as a teacher.”
“He wanted to stay here? Why?” asked Harry, more amazed still.
“I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,” said
Dumbledore. “Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school
than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place
he had felt at home.”
Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts
too.
“Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated
many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt
that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.
“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and
wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on
best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an
instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he
saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.”
“But he didn’t get the job, sir?”
“No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him
to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach.”
“How did you feel about that, sir?” asked Harry hesitantly.
“Deeply uneasy,” said Dumbledore. “I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did
not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and
convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not
in a position of power.”
“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?”
Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name
of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.
“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what
a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no
mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that
only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with
unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures
for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.”
“I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain himself.
“Well, quite,” said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. “And now it is time to hear from Hokey the
house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.”
Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling
memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After you, Harry.”
Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until
his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front
of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that
flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small
jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the
tiniest and oldest house-elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.
“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously. “He said he’d come at four, it’s only a couple of
minutes to and he’s never been late yet!”
She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top of the elf’s head
barely reached the seat of Hepzibah’s chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp
linen sheet she wore draped like a toga.
“How do I look?” said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the
mirror.
“Lovely, madam,” squeaked Hokey.
Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s contract that she must lie through her
teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his
opinion.
A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.
“Quick, quick, he’s here, Hokey!” cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which
was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across
it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes,
cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted
plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a
conservatory.
The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty
whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little
longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked
more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he
had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah’s fat little hand, brushing it with his
lips.
“I brought you flowers,” he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere.
“You naughty boy, you shouldn’t have!” squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she
had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. “You do spoil this old lady, Tom…Sit
down, sit down…Where’s Hokey? Ah…”
The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set
at her mistress’s elbow.
“Help yourself, Tom,” said Hepzibah, “I know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You
look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I’ve said it a hundred times…”
Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.
“Well, what’s your excuse for visiting this time?” she asked, batering her lashes.
“Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,” said Voldemort.
“Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair —”
“Now, now, not so fast, or I’ll think you’re only here for my trinkets!” pouted Hepzibah.
“I am ordered here because of them,” said Voldemort quietly. “I am only a poor assistant,
madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire —”
“Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!” said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. “I’ve something to show you that
I’ve never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won’t tell Mr.
Burke I’ve got it? He’d never let me rest if he knew I’d shown it to you, and I’m not selling, not to
Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you’ll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you
can get for it.”
“I’d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,” said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah
gave another girlish giggle.
“I had Hokey bring it out for me…Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest
treasure…In fact, bring both, while you’re at it…”
“Here, madam,” squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the
other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding
them over her head as she wended her way between tables, pouffes, and footstools.
“Now,” said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and
preparing to open the topmost one, “I think you’ll like this, Tom…Oh, if my family knew I was
showing you…They can’t wait to get their hands on this!”
She opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a
small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.
“I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!” whispered
Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out
of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy
expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah’s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon
Voldemort’s handsome features.
“A badger,” murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. “Then this was…?”
“Helga Hufflepuff’s, as you very well know, you clever boy!” said Hepzibah, leaning forward
with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. “Didn’t I tell you I was
distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn’t it?
And all sorts of powers it’s supposed to possess too, but I haven’t tested them thoroughly, I just keep
it nice and safe in here…”
She hooked the cup back off Voldemort’s long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too
intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort’s
face as the cup was taken away.
“Now then,” said Hepzibah happily, “where’s Hokey? Oh yes, there you are — take that away
now, Hokey.”
The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter
box in her lap.
“I think you’ll like this even more, Tom,” she whispered. “Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can
see…Of course, Burke knows I’ve got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he’d love to get
it back when I’m gone…”
She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson
velvet lay a heavy golden locket.
Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring
at it.
“Slytherin’s mark,” he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S.
“That’s right!” said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her
locket, transfixed. “I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn’t let it pass, not a real treasure
like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking
woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value —”
There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort’s eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry
saw his knuckles whiten on the locket’s chain.
“— I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are…Pretty, isn’t it? And again, all kinds of
powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe…”
She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going
to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.
“So there you are, Tom, clear, and I hope you enjoyed that!”
She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter.
“Are you all right, dear?”
“Oh yes,” said Voldemort quietly. “Yes, I’m very well…”
“I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose —” said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry
guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemort’s eyes.
“Here, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again…The usual enchantments…”
“Time to leave, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the
boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through
oblivion and back to Dumbledore’s office.
“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and
indicating that Harry should do the same. “Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of
poisoning her mistress’s evening cocoa by accident.”
“No way!” said Harry angrily.
“I see we are of one mind,” said Dumbledore. “Certainly, there are many similarities between
this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a
clear memory of having caused the death —”
“Hokey confessed?”
“She remembered putting something in her mistress’s cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but
a lethal and little-known poison,” said Dumbledore. “It was concluded that she had not meant to do
it, but being old and confused —”
“Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!”
“Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said Dumbledore. “And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was
predisposed to suspect Hokey —”
“— because she was a house-elf,” said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the
society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W.
“Precisely,” said Dumbledore. “She was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink,
and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I
traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over — but her memory, of
course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.
“By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah’s family had realized that two of her greatest
treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places,
having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that
the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the
young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post
and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his
disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time.
“Now,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your
attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was
his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have
seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor,
besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage,
just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin’s ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibahs cup and locket.”
“But,” said Harry, frowning, “it seems mad…Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for
those…”
“Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,” said Dumbledore. “I hope you will understand in
due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not
difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.”
“The locket maybe,” said Harry, “but why take the cup as well?”
“It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” said Dumbledore. “I think he still felt a
great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history.
There were other reasons, I think…I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course.
“And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve
Professor Slughorn’s memory for us. Ten years separates Hokey’s memory and this one, ten years
during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing…”
Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve.
“Whose memory is it?” he asked.
“Mine,” said Dumbledore.
And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he
had just left. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was
Dumbledore, who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both hands
were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between
the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting
past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge.
The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after
their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, “Enter.”
Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those
Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-
like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome
Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly
distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were
not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his
face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.
The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently this visit had been made
by appointment.
“Good evening, Tom,” said Dumbledore easily. “Won’t you sit down?”
“Thank you,” said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured — the
very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present. “I heard that you had become
headmaster,” he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. “A worthy
choice.”
“I am glad you approve,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “May I offer you a drink?”
“That would be welcome,” said Voldemort. “I have come a long way.”
Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve, but which
then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he
returned to the seat behind his desk.
“So, Tom…to what do I owe the pleasure?”
Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.
“They do not call me ‘Tom’ anymore,” he said. “These days, I am known as —”
“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, smiling, pleasantly. “But to me, I’m afraid,
you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that
they never quite forget their charges’ youthful beginnings.”
He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless.
Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use
Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and
Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such.
“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a short pause. “I always
wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.”
“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more
important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you
once saw the attraction of teaching too.”
“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why you — who are so often asked for advice
by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister —”
“Three times at the last count, actually,” said Dumbledore. “But the Ministry never attracted me
as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think.”
Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine. Dumbledore did not
break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy,
for Voldemort to talk first.
“I have returned,” he said, after a little while, “later, perhaps, than Professor Dippet
expected…but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young
to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you
must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your
students things they can gain from no other wizard.”
Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking.
“Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us,” he said quietly.
“Rumors of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of
them.”
Voldemort’s expression remained impassive as he said, “Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders
spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.”
“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do you?” asked Dumbledore delicately.
“Certainly,” said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. “I have experimented; I have
pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed —”
“Of some kinds of magic,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly. “Of some. Of others, you
remain…forgive me…woefully ignorant.”
For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a
look of rage.
“The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your
famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.”
“Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” suggested Dumbledore.
“Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts?” said
Voldemort. “Will you let me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I
place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.”
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “And what will become of those whom you command? What
will happen to those who call themselves — or so rumor has it — the Death Eaters?”
Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw
Voldemort’s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.
“My friends,” he said, after a moment’s pause, “will carry on without me, I am sure.”
“I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,” said Dumbledore. “I was under the
impression that they are more in the order of servants.”
“You are mistaken,” said Voldemort.
“Then if I were to go to the Hog’s Head tonight, I would not find a group of them — Nott,
Rosier, Muldber, Dolohov — awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with
you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.”
There could be no doubt that Dumbledore’s detailed knowledge of those with whom he was
traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied almost at once.
“You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.”
“Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said Dumbledore lightly. “Now, Tom…”
Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers
together in a very characteristic gesture.
“Let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a
job we both know you do not want?”
Voldemort looked coldly surprised. “A job I do not want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want
it very much.”
“Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you
wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you’re after, Tom? Why not try an open request for
once?”
Voldemort sneered. “If you do not want to give me a job —”
“Of course I don’t,” said Dumbledore. “And I don’t think for a moment you expected me to.
Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose.”
Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage.
“This is your final word?”
“It is,” said Dumbledore, also standing.
“Then we have nothing more to say to each other.”
“No, nothing,” said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. “The time is long gone
when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your
crimes. But I wish I could, Tom…I wish I could…”
For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that
Voldemort’s hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed,
Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone.
Harry felt Dumbledore’s hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing
together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and
Dumbledore’s hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.
“Why?” said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore’s face. “Why did he come back? Did
you ever find out?”
“I have ideas,” said Dumbledore, “but no more than that.”
“What ideas, sir?”
“I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,” said
Dumbledore. “When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear…to
both of us.”
Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and
was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.
“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t say…”
“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,” said Dumbledore. “The
aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over
the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing
what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the
Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before.
“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening.
“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been for the Prince, Ron wouldn’t be sitting
here now.”
“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first year,” said Hermione dismissively.
Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation (“Sectumsempra!”) scrawled in a margin
above the intriguing words “For enemies,” and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in
front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.
They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow
sixth years. There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from
dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test.
Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the
option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in
Hogsmeade.
Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he
would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little
more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the
test whether ready or not.
“At least you can Apparate, though!” said Ron tensely. “You’ll have no trouble come July!”
“I’ve only done it once,” Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and
rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson.
Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish
a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully
expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle
dementors, but he did not care: Slughorns memory was the most important thing to him now.
“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with this, Harry!” said
Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that’s
the Imperius Curse, which is illegal —”
“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book. “That’s why I’m looking
for something different. Dumbledore says Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something
else, a potion or a spell…”
“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “Only you can get the memory,
Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people can’t. It’s not a
question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that —”
“How do you spell ‘belligerent’?” said Ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his
parchment. “It can’t be B — U — M —”
“No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s essay toward her. “And ‘augury’ doesn’t begin O —
R — G either. What kind of quill are you using?”
“It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones, but I think the charm must be wearing off.”
“Yes, it must,” said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, “because we were asked how
we’d deal with dementors, not ‘Dug-bogs’, and I don’t remember you changing your name to
‘Roonil Wazlib’ either.”
“Ah no!” said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. “Don’t say I’ll have to write the
whole thing out again!”
“It’s okay, we can fix it,” said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand.
“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily.
Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender hear you saying that.”
“I won’t,” said Ron into his hands. “Or maybe I will, then she’ll ditch me.”
“Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” asked Harry.
“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said Ron. “You and Cho just —”
“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry.
“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione
silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected
themselves on the page. “But the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It’s like
going out with the giant squid.”
“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron’s essay.
“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion?” Harry, who had
found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes so far, looked around; the three of them were
now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and
his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph
on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning,
when —
Crack.
Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry
said, “Kreacher!”
The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. “Master said he wanted regular
reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to give —”
Crack.
Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew. “Dobby has been helping too,
Harry Potter!” he squeaked, casting Kreacher a resentful look. “And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby
when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together!”
“What is this?” asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. “What’s
going on, Harry?”
Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Hermione about setting Kreacher and
Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her.
“Well…they’ve been following Malfoy for me,” he said.
“Night and day,” croaked Kreacher.
“Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!” said Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood.
Hermione looked indignant.
“You haven’t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn’t tell him not to —”
“No, of course I didn’t,” said Harry quickly. “Dobby, you can sleep, all right? But has either of
you found out anything?” he hastened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again.
“Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,” croaked Kreacher at once.
“His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of —”
“Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily. “A bad boy who — who —” He
shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though
about to dive into it. Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the
middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.
“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted. “Dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old
masters.”
Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher, “But
Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry told Kreacher. “Let’s
fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he
sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been going anywhere he
shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, “the Malfoy
boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been
making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him
while he enters —”
“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced
Potion-Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him. “That’s where he’s been sneaking off to! That’s
where he’s doing…whatever he’s doing! And I bet that’s why he’s been disappearing off the map —
come to think of it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on there!”
“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,” said Ron.
“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said Hermione. “If you need it to be unplottable,
it will be.”
“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s doing?” said Harry eagerly.
“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby.
“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our headquarters there last year, so I’ll be
able to get in and spy on him, no problem.”
“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione slowly. “Malfoy already knew exactly how
we were using the room, didn’t he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room
to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room becomes
when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform into.”
“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry dismissively. “You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby.”
“Kreachers done well too,” said Hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher
averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, “The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher,
Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear —”
“Get out of it,” Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated.
“You’d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.”
“Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby happily, and he too vanished.
“How good is this?” said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the
room was elf-free again. “We know where Malfoy’s going! We’ve got him cornered now!”
“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink chat
had recently been an almost completed essay. Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning
the ink off with her wand.
“But what’s all this about him going up there with a variety of students’?” said Hermione. “How
many people are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s doing—”
“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it wasn’t Crabbe’s
business what he was doing…so what’s he telling all these…all these…” Harry’s voice tailed away;
he was staring at the fire. “God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon…He could’ve nicked some any time during that lesson…”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.
“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions
lesson…There aren’t a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy…it’s just Crabbe and
Goyle as usual…Yeah, it all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire.
“They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them what he’s up to, but he
doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he’s got them
taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people…Those two girls I saw him with when he
missed Quidditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle!”
“Do you mean to say,” said Hermione in a hushed voice, “that that little girl whose scales I
repaired —?”
“Yeah, of course!” said Harry loudly, staring at her. “Of course! Malfoy must’ve been inside the
room at the time, so she — what am I talking about? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to
come out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn
too! We’ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!”
“He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?” guffawed Ron. “Blimey…no wonder they
don’t look too happy these days. I’m surprised they don’t tell him to stuff it.”
“Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them his Dark Mark?” said Harry.
“Hmmm…the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said Hermione skeptically, rolling up Ron’s
dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.
“We’ll see” said Harry confidently.
“Yes, we will,” Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. “But, Harry, before you get all
excited, I still don’t think you’ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing
what’s there first. And I don’t think you should forget”— she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and
gave him a very serious look — “that what you’re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that
memory from Slughorn. Good night.”
Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the girls’ dormitories had
closed behind her he rounded on Ron. “What d’you think?”
“Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,” said Ron, staring at the spot where Dobby had
vanished. “I’d have that Apparition Test in the bag.”
Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how
Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there
the following day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see
the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy’s, what could it be? A meeting place? A
hideout? A store-room? A workshop? Harry’s mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he
finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who
turned into Snape…
Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; he had a free
period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the
Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered
plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he thought she might be a lot
of help if she wanted to.
“Look,” he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet, which she had
just removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. “I haven’t
forgotten about Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a
brain wave why shouldn’t I find out what Malfoy’s doing?”
“I’ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,” said Hermione. “It’s not a question of
tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing
around outside the Room of Requirement”— she jerked the Prophet out from under Harry’s hand
and unfolded it to look at the front page — “you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to
his better nature.”
“Anyone we know —?” asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.
“Yes!” said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast. “But it’s all right,
he’s not dead — its Mundungus, he’s been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with
impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary, and someone called Octavius Pepper has
vanished. Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his
grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse.”
They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron
for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape’s dementor essay, and
Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas
the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.
Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not
have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether
his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out, but at least his first
attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an
eleven-year-old girl.
He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirement’s door was
concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year.
Concentrating with all his might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here…I need to see
what Malfoy’s doing in here…I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here…
Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his
eyes and faced it — but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall. He moved forward
and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding.
“Okay,” said Harry aloud. “Okay…I thought the wrong thing…” He pondered for a moment
then set off again, eyes closed, concentrating as hard as he could. I need to see the place where Malfoy
keeps coming secretly…I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly…After three walks past,
he opened his eyes expectantly.
There was no door.
“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall irritably. “That was a clear instruction. Fine.” He thought
hard for several minutes before striding off once more. I need you to become the place you become for
Draco Malfoy…
He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard,
as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant
twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes.
There was still no door.
Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back
around the corner, apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly
foulmouthed ghost.
Harry tried every variation of I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you that he could
think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have
had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frus-trated and annoyed, he set off for
Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he
went.
“Late again, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. “Ten
points from Gryfrindor.” Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron. Half
the class were still on their feet, taking out books and organizing their things; he could not be much
later than any of them.
“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that
twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. “And I
hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse.
Now, if you will all open your books to page — what is it, Mr. Finnigan?”
“Sir,” said Seamus, “I’ve been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and
a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius —”
“No, there wasn’t,” said Snape in a bored voice.
“But sir, I heard people talking —”
“If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the
so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.”
“I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered Harry to Ron and
Hermione. “Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest —”
“But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back
of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. “Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference
between an Inferius and a ghost.”
The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told
him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn. “Er — well — ghosts are transparent —” he
said.
“Oh, very good,” interrupted Snape, his lip curling. “Yes, it in easy to see that nearly six years of
magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. ‘Ghosts are transparent.’”
Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other people were smirking. Harry took a
deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent,
but Inferi are dead bodies, aren’t they? So they’d be solid —”
“A five-year-old could have told us as much,” sneered Snape. “The Inferius is a corpse that has
been reanimated by a Dark wizard’s spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the
wizard’s bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul
left upon the earth, and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent.”
“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them apart!” said Ron. “When we
come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we’re going to be having a look to see if its solid,
aren’t we, we’re not going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?’”
There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class.
“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I would expect nothing more sophisticated
from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.”
“No!” whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as he opened his mouth furiously. “There’s no
point, you’ll just end up in detention again, leave it!”
“Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,” said Snape, smirking a little, “and
read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse.”
Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson,
Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she
approached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron’s Apparition, but this seemed to merely
irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with Harry.
“Snape’s right, though, isn’t he?” said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or
two. “I dunno whether it’s worth me taking the test. I just can’t get the hang of Apparition.”
“You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,” said
Harry reasonably. “It’ll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if
you’re still not — you know — as good as you’d like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me
over the summer — Myrtle, this is the boys’ bathroom!”
The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in
midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. “Oh,” she said glumly. “It’s you two.”
“Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.
“Nobody,” said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. “He said he’d come back and see
me, but then you said you’d pop in and visit me too”— she gave Harry a reproachful look — “and I
haven’t seen you for months and months. I’ve learned not to expect too much from boys.”
“I thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom?” said Harry, who had been careful to give the place
a wide berth for some years now.
“I do,” she said, with a sulky little shrug, “but that doesn’t mean I can’t visit other places. I came
and saw you in your bath once, remember?”
“Vividly,” said Harry.
“But I thought he liked me,” she said plaintively. “Maybe if you two left, he’d come back again.
We had lots in common. I’m sure he felt it.”
And she looked hopefully toward the door. “When you say you had lots in common,” said Ron,
sounding rather amused now, “d’you mean he lives in an S-bend too?”
“No,” said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. “I mean
he’s sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn’t got anybody to talk to, and he’s
not afraid to show his feelings and cry!”
“There’s been a boy in here crying?” said Harry curiously. “A young boy?”
“Never you mind!” said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely
grinning. “I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone, and I’ll take his secret to the —”
“— not the grave, surely?” said Ron with a snort. “The sewers, maybe.” Myrtle gave a howl of
rage and dived back into the toilet, causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading
Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. “You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back
over his shoulder, “I’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.”
And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would
turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get
ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day,
one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to
attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement.
“You’d do better,” said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance
hall, “to go straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get that memory from him.”
“I’ve been trying!” said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every
Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the
dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and
knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly
stifled sounds of an old gramophone.
“He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I’ve been trying to get him on his own
again, and he’s not going to let it happen!”
“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?”
The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his usual prodding act with
the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by
the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble
staircase again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of
Requirement.
Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map and his Invisibility
Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, “I solemnly swear that
I am up to no good,” and scanned it carefully.
As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the
Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the
Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the
library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventh-
floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was
not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map
was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the
corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl,
clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited
until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering, “Hello…you’re very pretty,
aren’t you?”
Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away,
vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the
corri-dor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco
Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to
make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what
form of words he had not yet tried.
Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried many more variations of
his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated
beyond belief Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of
evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and
kicked it.
“OUCH!”
He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the
Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.
“Harry?”
He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks,
walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.
“What’re you doing here?” he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find
him lying on the floor?
“I came to see Dumbledore,” said Tonks. Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual,
her mouse-colored hair lank.
“His office isn’t here,” said Harry, “it’s round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle—”
“I know,” said Tonks. “He’s not there. Apparently he’s gone away again.”
“Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. “Hey — you don’t
know where he goes, I suppose?”
“No,” said Tonks.
“What did you want to see him about?”
“Nothing in particular,” said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe.
“I just thought he might know what’s going on. I’ve heard rumors…people getting hurt.”
“Yeah, I know, it’s all been in the papers,” said Harry. “That little kid trying to kill his —”
“The Prophet’s often behind the times,” said Tonks, who didn’t seem to be listening to him.
“You haven’t had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?”
“No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said Harry, “not since Sirius —” He saw that
her eyes had filled with tears.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly. “I mean…I miss him, as well.”
“What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. “Well…I’ll see you around,
Harry…”
And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her.
After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the
Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the
knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt
and leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to
come.
He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.
“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. “I was
supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up
near Scrivenshafts, but at least I moved!”
“Good one,” said Harry. “How’d you do, Hermione?”
“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before Hermione could answer. “Perfect
deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in
the Three Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross going on about her — I’ll be
surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon —”
“And what about you?” asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. “Have you been up at the Room of
Requirement all this time?”
“Yep,” said Harry. “And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!”
“Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.
“Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore.”
“If you ask me,” said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks,
“she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry.”
“It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. “She’s supposed to
be guarding the school, why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when
he’s not even here?”
“I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more
Hermione’s territory than his. “You don’t think she can have been…you know…in love with
Sirius?”
Hermione stared at him. “What on earth makes you say that?”
“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging, “but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name, and
her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. I wondered whether it hadn’t become…you
know…him.”
“It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly. “But I still don’t know why she’d be bursting into the
castle to see Dumbledore, if that’s really why she was here.”
“Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his
mouth. “She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,” he said wisely to Harry, “they’re easily
upset.”
“And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I doubt you’d find a woman who sulked
for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and
the Mimbulus mimbletonia.”
Ron scowled.
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
AFTER THE BURIAL
Patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets, but these signs of
approaching summer did not lift Harry’s mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find
out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead,
somehow, to Slughorn hand-ing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades.
“For the last time, just forget about Malfoy,” Hermione told Harry firmly.
They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch. Hermione and Ron
were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet — Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid
Them — for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not
proved soothing to the nerves.
Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner.
“It isn’t Lavender,” said Hermione wearily.
“Oh, good,” said Ron, relaxing.
“Harry Potter?” said the girl. “I was asked to give you this.”
“Thanks…”
Harry’s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he
said, “Dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!”
“Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” suggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the
parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledore’s long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy
sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink
had run.
Dear Harry, Ron and Hermione!
Aragog died last night. Harry and Ron, you met him and you know how special he was.
Hermione, I know you’d have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if you’d nip down for the burial
later this evening. I’m planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day.
I know you’re not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldn’t ask, but I can’t
face it alone.
Hagrid
“Look at this,” said Harry, handing the note to Hermione.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake,” she said, scanning it quickly and passing it to Ron, who read it through
looking increasingly incredulous.
“He’s mental!” he said furiously. “That thing told its mates to eat Harry and me! Told them to
help themselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!”
“It’s not just that,” said Hermione. “He’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows
security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught.”
“We’ve been down to see him by night before,” said Harry.
“Yes, but for something like this?” said Hermione. “We’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but
after all — Aragog’s dead. If it were a question of saving him —”
“— I’d want to go even less,” said Ron firmly. “You didn’t meet him, Hermione. Believe me,
being dead will have improved him a lot.”
Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it. Tears had clearly
fallen thick and fast upon the parchment…
“Harry, you can’t be thinking of going,” said Hermione. “It’s such a pointless thing to get
detention for.”
Harry sighed. “Yeah, I know,” he said. “I s’pose Hagrid’ll have to bury Aragog without us.”
“Yes, he will,” said Hermione, looking relieved. “Look, Potions will be almost empty this
afternoon, with us all off doing our tests…Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then!”
“Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think?” said Harry bitterly.
“Lucky,” said Ron suddenly. “Harry, that’s it — get lucky!”
“What d’you mean?”
“Use your lucky potion!”
“Ron, that’s — that’s it!” said Hermione, sounding stunned. “Of course! Why didn’t I think of
it?”
Harry stared at them both. “Felix Felicis?” he said. “I dunno…I was sort of saving it…”
“What for?” demanded Ron incredulously.
“What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?” asked Hermione.
Harry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his
imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with
Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the
depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and
waking…
“Harry? Are you still with us?” asked Hermione.
“Wha —? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling himself together. “Well…okay. If I can’t get
Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.”
“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful
pirouette. “Destination…determination…deliberation…” she murmured.
“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as it is — quick, hide me!”
“It isn’t Lavender!” said Hermione impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the
courtyard and Ron dived behind her.
“Cool,” said Ron, peering over Hermiones shoulder to check. “Blimey, they don’t look happy,
do they?”
“They’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they don’t look happy, didn’t you hear what
happened to their little brother?” said Hermione.
“I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s relatives, to be honest,” said Ron.
“Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is that their mother refused to help
the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungos, they couldn’t save
him.”
“He died?” repeated Harry, shocked. “But surely werewolves don’t kill, they just turn you into
one of them?”
“They sometimes kill,” said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. “I’ve heard of it happening
when the werewolf gets carried away.”
“What was the werewolf’s name?” said Harry quickly.
“Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,” said Hermione.
“I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me about!” said Harry
angrily.
Hermione looked at him bleakly.
“Harry, you’ve got to get that memory,” she said. “It’s all about stopping Voldemort, isn’t it?
These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him…”
The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking
terrified.
“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest
of the people taking their Apparition Test. “Good luck.”
“And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off to the dungeons.
There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and Draco Malfoy.
“All too young to Apparate just yet?” said Slughorh genially, “Not turned seventeen yet?”
They shook their heads.
“Ah well,” said Slughorn cheerily, “as we’re so few, we’ll do something for fun. I want you all to
brew me up something amusing!”
“That sounds good, sir,” said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his hands together. Malfoy, on the
other hand, did not crack a smile.
“What do you mean, ‘something amusing’?” he said irritably.
“Oh, surprise me,” said Slughorn airily.
Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making with a sulky expression. It could not have
been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching
him over the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending
in the Room of Requirement.
Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner! Certainly he looked paler; his
skin still had that grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was
no air of smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts
Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort…There could
be only one conclusion, in Harry’s opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly.
Cheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making and
found a heavily corrected Half-Blood Prince’s version of “An Elixir to Induce Euphoria,” which
seemed not only to meet Slughorn’s instructions, but which might (Harry’s heart leapt as the
thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over
that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some…
“Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,” said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping
his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harry’s cauldron.
“Euphoria, I take it? And what’s that I smell? Mmmm…you’ve added just a sprig of peppermint,
haven’t you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would tend to
counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking…I really don’t
know where you get these brain waves, my boy…unless —”
Harry pushed the Half-Blood Prince’s book deeper into his bag with his foot.
“— it’s just your mother’s genes coming out in you!”
“Oh…yeah, maybe,” said Harry, relieved.
Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry for once, he had most rashly
invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of
his cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping
Solution merely “passable.”
The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once. “Sir,” Harry began, but Slughorn
immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and
Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could.
“Professor — Professor, don’t you want to taste my po —?” called Harry desperately.
But Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the caul-dron, packed up his things, left
the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.
Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon.
“Harry!” cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. “Harry, I passed!”
“Well done!” he said. “And Ron?”
“He — he just failed,” whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most
morose. “It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that he’d left half an eyebrow
behind…How did it go with Slughorn?”
“No joy,” said Harry, as Ron joined them. “Bad luck, mate, but you’ll pass next time — we can
take it together.”
“Yeah, I s’pose,” said Ron grumpily. “But half an eyebrow – like that matters!”
“I know,” said Hermione soothingly, “it does seem really harsh…”
They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner, and Ron looked
fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the
continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory.
“So, Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?” Ron demanded.
“Yeah, I s’pose I’d better,” said Harry. “I don’t reckon I’ll need all of it, not twelve hours’ worth,
it can’t take all night…I’ll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.”
“It’s a great feeling when you take it,” said Ron reminiscently. “Like you can’t do anything
wrong.”
“What are you talking about?” said Hermione, laughing. “You’ve never taken any!”
“Yeah, but I thought I had, didn’t I?” said Ron, as though ex-plaining the obvious. “Same
difference really…”
As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time
over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to
Slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the
level of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after check-
ing carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys’
dormitory.
Harry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming
bottle.
“Well, here goes,” said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp.
“What does it feel like?” whispered Hermione.
Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite
opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all…and
getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only pos-sible, but positively easy…
He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.
“Excellent,” he said. “Really excellent. Right…I’m going down to Hagrid’s.”
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast.
“No, Harry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?” said Hermione.
“No,” said Harry confidently. “I’m going to Hagrid’s, I’ve got a good feeling about going to
Hagrid’s.”
“You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked Ron, looking stunned.
“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. “I feel like it’s the place to be
tonight, you know what I mean?”
“No,” said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now.
“This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?” said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light.
“You haven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t know —”
“Essence of Insanity?” suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders.
Harry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed.
“Trust me,” he said. “I know what I’m doing…or at least” he strolled confidently to the door —
“Felix does.”
He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione
hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door.
“What were you doing up there with her” shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry
at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys’ dormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering
behind him as he darted across the room away from them.
Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came
through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against
Ginny.
“Don’t push me, please, Dean,” she said, sounding annoyed. “You’re always doing that, I can get
through perfectly well on my own…”
The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry
retort…His feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to
creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. This
evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.
Why he knew that going to Hagrid’s was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though
the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the final destination,
he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that
memory. When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door.
Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before
walking down the steps into the dusk.
It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to
pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid’s. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to
Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he directed his feet immediately toward the
vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in
conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the
world and listening to their conversation.
“I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,” Slughorn was saying courteously, “most
authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.”
“Oh, I quite agree,” said Professor Sprout warmly. “That enough for you?”
“Plenty, plenty,” said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. “This
should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews
them…Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!”
Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and
Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible.
Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pullet I off the cloak with a flourish.
“Good evening, Professor.”
“Merlin’s beard, Harry, you made me jump,” said Slughotn, stopping dead in his tracks and
looking wary. “How did you get out of the castle?”
“I think Filch must’ve forgotten to lock the doors,” said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to
see Slughorn scowl.
“I’ll be reporting that man, he’s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask
me…But why are you out then, Harry?”
“Well, sir, it’s Hagrid,” said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the
truth. “He’s pretty upset…But you won’t tell anyone, Professor? I don’t want trouble for him…”
Slughorn’s curiosity was evidently aroused. “Well, I can’t promise that,” he said gruffly. “But I
know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I’m sure he can’t be up to anything very
dreadful…”
“Well, it’s this giant spider, he’s had it for years…It lived in the forest…It could talk and
everything —”
“I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,” said Slughorn softly, looking over at the
mass of black trees. “It’s true, then?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He’s
devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said I’d go.”
“Touching, touching,” said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the
distant lights of Hagrid’s cabin. “But acromantula venom is very valuable…If the beast only just
died it might not yet have dried out…Of course, I wouldn’t want to do anything insensitive if
Hagrid is upset…but if there was any way to procure some…I mean, it’s almost impossible to get
venom from an acromantula while it’s alive…”
Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. “…seems an awful waste not to
collect it…might get a hundred Galleons a pint…To be frank, my salary is not large…”
And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. “Well,” he said, with a most convincing
hesitancy, “well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased…Give
Aragog a better send-off, you know…”
“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with en-thusiasm. “I tell you what, Harry,
I’ll meet you down there with a bottle or two…We’ll drink the poor beast’s — well — not health —
but we’ll send it off in style, anyway, once it’s buried. And I’ll change my tie, this one is a little
exuberant for the occasion…”
He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid’s, delighted with himself.
“Yeh came,” croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the
Invisibility Cloak in front of him.
“Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though,” said Harry. “They’re really sorry.”
“Don — don matter…Hed’ve bin touched yeh’re here, though, Harry…”
Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag
dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on
the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach.
“Where are we burying him?” he asked. “The forest?”
“Blimey, no,” said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bot-tom of his shirt. “The other
spiders won’ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog’s gone. Turns out it was only on his
orders they didn’ eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?”
The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had
come face-to-face with the aero-mantulas. They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing
that stopped them from eating Hagrid.
“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” said Hagrid, shaking his head. “It wasn’
easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead, see…But I
wanted ter give ‘im a nice burial…a proper send-off…”
He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for
the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), “Professor Slughorn met me coming
down here, Hagrid.”
“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in
the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”
“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay his last respects to
Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into something more suitable, I think…and he said
he’d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog’s memory…”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him,
that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn
before…Comin’ ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well…he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would…”
Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample
amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where
he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled
and tangled.
“Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?”
“Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said Hagrid in a choked voice. “I’ve already dug
the — yeh know — grave. Jus’ thought we’d say a few nice things over him — happy memories, yeh
know —”
His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it,
blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold,
several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat.
“Hagrid,” he said, in a deep, grave voice. “So very sorry to hear of your loss.”
“Tha’s very nice of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Thanks a lot. An’ thanks fer not givin Harry detention
neither…”
“Wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said Slughorn. “Sad night, sad night…Where is the poor
creature?”
“Out here,” said Hagrid in a shaking voice. “Shall we — shall we do it, then?”
The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through
the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate
Aragogs body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot- high mound of freshly dug earth.
“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spiders head, where eight milky eyes stared
blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thougln
he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous
hairy head.
“Its not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are’ said H grid to Slughorn’s back, tears leaking
from the corners of his crinkled eyes. “I didn’ know yeh were interested in creatures like Aragog,
Horace.”
“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said Slughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry
saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more,
noticed nothing. “Now…shall we proceed to the burial?”
Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and, with an
enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud.
Hagrid started to cry again.
“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” said Slughorn, who like Harry could reach
no higher than Hagrid’s elbow, but patted it all the same. “Why don’t I say a few words?”
He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a
satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell,
Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget!
Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest
home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the
loss they have sustained.”
“Tha was…tha was…beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying
harder than ever.
“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then
fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. “Lets get inside
and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry…That’s it…Up you come, Hagrid…Well done…”
They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during
the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry’s lap as usual.
Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought.
“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of
Hagrid’s bucket-sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. “Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what
happened to your poor friend Rupert.”
Harry saw, in his mind’s eye, the expression on Hermione’s face if she ever heard about this
abuse of houseelves, and decided never to mention it to her.
“One for Harry…” said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two mugs, “…and one for
me. Well”— he raised his mug high — “to Aragog.”
“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together. Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry,
however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so
he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him.
“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “‘Tiny little thing he was when he
hatched. ‘Bout the size of a Pekingese”
“Sweet,” said Slughorn.
“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until…well…”
Hagrid’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown
out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be
listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long,
silky skein of bright white hair.
“That’s not unicorn hair, Hagrid?”
“Oh, yeah,” said Hagrid indifferently. “Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches
an’ stuff in the forest, yeh know…”
“But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth?”
“I use it fer bindin’ on bandages an’ stuff if a creature gets in jured,” said Hagrid, shrugging. “It’s
dead useful…very strong.”
Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin
now, looking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful suply
of oak-matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smoking jackets. He refilled Hagrid’s mug
and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how
Hagrid was able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming expan-sive under the influence of the drink
and Slughorn’s flattering interest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long
explanation of bowtruckle husbandry.
The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink
that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the
Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it
tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn
(now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the able at the
emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.
After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to
Dumbledore, to elf-made wine, and to —
“Harry Potter!” bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin
as he drained it.
“Yes, indeed,” cried Slughorn a little thickly, “Parry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who — well —
something of that sort,” he mumbled, and drained his mug too.
Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon
Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, “To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!”
And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each
other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.
“Aaargh, the good die young,” muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed,
while Slughorn continued to war-ble the refrain. “Me dad was no age ter go…nor were yer mum’ an’
dad, Harry…”
Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid’s crinkled eyes again; he grasped Harry’s arm
and shook it
“Bes’ wiz and witchard o’ their age…I never knew…terrible thing…terrible thing…”
And Odo the hero, they bore him back home
To the place that he’d known as a lad,
sang Slughorn plaintively.
They laid him to rest with his hat inside out.
And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.
“…terrible,” Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell
asleep, snoring deeply.
“Sorry,” said Slughorn with a hiccup. “Can’t carry a tune to save my life.”
“Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said Harry quietly. “He was talking about my mum
and dad dying.”
“Oh,” said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. “Oh dear. Yes, that was — was terrible indeed.
Terrible…terrible…”
He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their mugs.
“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry?” he asked awkwardly.
“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle
flickering in Hagrid’s heavy snores. “But I’ve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad
died first. Did you know that?”
“I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice.
“Yeah…Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum,” said
Harry.
Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from
Harry’s face.
“He told her to get out of the way,” said Harry remorselessly. “He told me she needn’t have
died. He only wanted me. She could have run.”
“Oh dear,” breathed Slughorn. “She could have…she needn’t…That’s awful…”
“It is, isn’t it?” said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. “But she didn’t move. Dad was
already dead, but she didn’t want me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort…but he just
laughed…”
“That’s enough!” said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking hand. “Really, my dear boy,
enough…I’m an old man…I don’t need to hear…I don’t want to hear…”
“I forgot,” lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. “You liked her, didn’t you?”
“Liked her?” said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more. “I don’t imagine anyone
who met her wouldn’t have liked her…Very brave…Very funny…It was the most horrible thing…”
“But you won’t help her son,” said Harry. “She gave me her life, but you won’t give me a
memory.”
Hagrid’s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily into Slughorn’s tear-filled eyes.
The Potions master seemed unable to look away.
“Don’t say that,” he whispered. “It isn’t a question…If it were to help you, of course…but no
purpose can be served…”
“It can,” said Harry clearly. “Dumbledore needs information. I need information.”
He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the
morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little.
“I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.”
Slughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat.
“You are the Chosen One?”
“Of course I am,” said Harry calmly.
“But then…my dear boy…you’re asking a great deal…you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in
your attempt to destroy —”
“You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?’”
“Harry, Harry, of course I do, but —”
“You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?”
Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified.
“Be brave like my mother, Professor…”
Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a
moment like an enormously overgrown baby.
“I am not proud…” he whispered through his fingers. “I am ashamed of what — of what that
memory shows…I think I may have done great damage that day…”
“You’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,” said Harry. “It would be a very
brave and noble thing to do.”
Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the
guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait.
Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other
hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harry’s eyes, Slughorn
touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory
came away too, clinging to the wand tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and
swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then
spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the
table to Harry.
“Thank you very much, Professor.”
“You’re a good boy,” said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus
mustache. “And you’ve got her eyes…Just don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it…”
And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep.
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
HORCRUXES
Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door
had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided
detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of
the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most
unhelpful mood.
“What sort of time do you call this?”
“I’m really sorry — I had to go out for something important —”
“Well, the password changed at midnight, so you’ll just have to sleep in the corridor, won’t
you?”
“You’re joking!” said Harry. “Why did it have to change at midnight?”
“That’s the way it is,” said the Fat Lady. “If you’re angry, go and take it up with the headmaster,
he’s the one who’s tightened security.”
“Fantastic,” said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. “Really brilliant. Yeah, I would
go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he’s the one who wanted me to —”
“He is here,” said a voice behind Harry. “Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour
ago.”
Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.
“I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,” said Nick. “He appeared, according to
the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.”
“Where is he?” said Harry, his heart leaping,”
“Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it’s a, favorite pastime of his —”
“Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!”
“Oh — in his office,” said Nick. “I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to
attend to before turning in —”
“Yeah, he has,” said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore
he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who
was calling after him.
“Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password’s still ‘tapeworm’!”
But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying
“toffee eclairs” to Dumbledore’s gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the
spiral staircase.
“Enter,” said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the
door. There was Dumbledore’s office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies
beyond the windows.
“Good gracious, Harry,” said Dumbledore in surprise. “To what do I owe this very late
pleasure?”
“Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.”
Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the
headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile.
“Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!”
All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the
bottle with Slughorn’s memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi
the Pensieve.
“And now,” said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents
of the bottle into it. “Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly…”
Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor…Once again he
fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn’s office many years before. There was the
much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache,
sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a
small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple. And there
were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them,
Marvolo’s gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger.
Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, “Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought
is retiring?”
“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at
Riddle, though winking at the same time. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get your
information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.”
Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.
“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the
people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite
—” Several of the boys tittered again. “— I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic
within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the
Ministry.”
Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means
the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader.
“I don’t know that politics would suit me, sir,” he said when the laughter had died away. “I
don’t have the right kind of background, for one thing.”
A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a
private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader’s famous
ancestor.
“Nonsense,” said Slughorn briskly, “couldn’t be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock,
abilities like yours. No, you’ll go far, Tom, I’ve never been wrong about a student yet.”
The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock behind him and he
looked around.
“Good gracious, is it that time already? You’d better get going boys, or we’ll all be in trouble.
Lestrange, I want your essay by in morrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”
One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and
carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was
still standing there.
“Look sharp, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect…”
“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.”
“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away…”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about…about Horcruxes?’
Slughorn stared at him, his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass.
“Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?”
But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork.
“Not exactly, sir,” said Riddle. “I came across the term while reading and I didn’t fully
understand it.”
“No…well…you’d be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that’ll give you details on
Horcruxes, Tom, that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,” said Slughorn.
“But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you — sorry, I mean, if you
can’t tell me, obviously —I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could—so I just thought I’d–”
It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of
it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of
reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information
very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks.
“Well,” said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of
crystallized pineapple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you
understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part
of their soul.”
“I don’t quite understand how that works, though, sir,” said Riddle.
His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement.
“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in an object outside the
body. Then, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains
earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form…”
Slughorn’s face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two
years before: “I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost…but still, I
was alive.”
“…few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.”
But Riddle’s hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his
longing.
“How do you split your soul?”
“Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain
intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.”
“But how do you do it?”
“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart.
The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would
encase the torn portion —”
“Encase? But how —?”
“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughoin shaking his head like an old
elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry…I didn’t mean to offend…”
“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn gruffly, “It is natural to feel some curiosity
about these things…Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic…”
“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, though — just out of curiosity — I mean,
would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn’t it be better, make
you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully
magical number, wouldn’t seven —?”
“Merlin’s beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Seven! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one
person? And in any case…bad enough to divide the soul…but to rip it into seven pieces…”
Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him
plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all.
“Of course,” he muttered, “this is all hypothetical, what we’re discussing, isn’t it? All
academic…”
“Yes, sir, of course,” said Riddle quickly.
“But all the same, Tom…keep it quiet, what I’ve told — that’s to say, what we’ve discussed.
People wouldn’t like to think we’ve been chatting about Horcruxes. It’s a banned subject at
Hogwarts, you know…Dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it…”
“I won’t say a word, sir,” said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face,
which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a
wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow,
less human…
“Thank you, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Let us go…”
When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was; already sitting down behind his
desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak.
“I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,” said Dumbledore at last. “It
confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far
there is still to go…”
Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the
portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed
wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet.
“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “I am sure you understood the significance of what we just
heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he
could to find out how to make himself immortal.”
“You think he succeeded then, sir?” asked Harry. “He made a Horcrux? And that’s why he didn’t
die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?”
“A bit…or more,” said Dumbledore. “You heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from
Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux,
what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to
murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcrux.
No book would have given him that information. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort
knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.”
Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, “Four years ago, I
received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.”
“Where?” asked Harry. “How?”
“You handed it to me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “The diary, Riddles diary, the one giving
instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.”
“I don’t understand, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me
was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A
mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much
more sinister had lived inside that book…a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had
been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me
most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.”
“I still don’t understand,” said Harry.
“Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the fragment of soul
concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its
owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of
his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin’s monster would be unleashed again.”
“Well, he didn’t want his hard work to be wasted,” said Harry. “He wanted people to know he
was Slytherin’s heir, because he couldn’t take credit at the time.”
“Quite correct,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “But don’t you see, Harry, that if he intended the
diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase
about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor
Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else’s path
and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul
is no more; you saw to that.
“The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It
suggested that he must have made — or had been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the
loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to
make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his
body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I who have gone
further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you told me he said.
‘Further than anybody!’ And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He
was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I don’t believe any other
wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing
years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was
mutitated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’…”
“So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?” said Harry. “Why couldn’t
he make a Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?”
“Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,” said Dumbledore. “But there are
several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer’s Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord
Voldemort.
“While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if
the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on
the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like
any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the
thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if
it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but
only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes.
He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you
see…or as close to immortal as any man can be.
“But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in
procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been
before. You heard him, Harry: ‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more
pieces…isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number…’ Isn’t seven the most powerfully magical
number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.”
“He made seven Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls
made similar noises of shock mid outrage. “But they could be anywhere in the world — hidden —
buried or invisible —”
“I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But
firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides
inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years
during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that
anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body.”
“But the six Horcruxes, then,” said Harry, a little desperately, “how are we supposed to find
them?”
“You are forgetting…you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.”
“You have?” said Harry eagerly.
“Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. “The ring,
Harry. Marvolo’s ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the
lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape’s timely action when
I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a
withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort’s soul. The ring
is no longer a Horcrux.”
“But how did you find it?”
“Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can
about Voldemort’s past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled
across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunt’s house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded
in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by
many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been
carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the
ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment.
“However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the
ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.”
“And they could be anything?” said Harry. “They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty
potion bottles…”
“You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But
would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are
forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred
objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his
determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me
that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the
honor.”
“The diary wasn’t that special.”
“The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that
Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.”
“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know what they are, sir?”
“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord
Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled
back through Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared
around him.”
“The locket!” said Harry loudly, “Hufflepuff’s cup!”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand —
but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming
again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having
secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by
Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a
powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find
anything of Ravenclaw’s. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains
safe.”
Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted
sword reposed within a glass case.
“Do you think that’s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?” said Harry. “To try
and find something from one of the other founders?”
“My thoughts precisely,” said Dumbledore. “But unfortunately, that does not advance us much
further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced
to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders’ objects. He definitely
had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.”
“Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of Gryffindor’s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,” said
Harry, counting on his fingers. “Unless he’s got both?”
“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore. “I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what
you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake,
Nagini?”
“The snake?” said Harry, startled. “You can use animals as Horcruxes?”
“Well, it is inadvisable to do so,” said Dumbledore, “because to confide a part of your soul to
something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my
calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he
entered your parents’ house with the intention of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process
of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He
believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he
was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your
death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old
Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She
underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mystique; I think he is
perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to
have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.”
“So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still
intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?”
“An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,” said Dumbledore, bowing his head.
“So…are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you’ve been going when you’ve been
leaving the school?”
“Correct,” said Dumbledore. “I have been looking for a very long time. I think…perhaps…I
may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.”
“And if you do,” said Harry quickly, “can I come with you and help get rid of it?”
Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, “Yes, I think so.”
“I can?” said Harry, thoroughly taken aback.
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I think you have earned that right.”
Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once.
The headmasters and head-mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore’s
decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.
“Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?” Harry asked, ignoring
the portraits.
“A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed
in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do.
Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss…but he was not aware, for instance,
that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort
discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger
was terrible to behold.”
“But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?”
“Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still
Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished
shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything
with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius’s fear of
a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not
know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the
Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a
portion of his masters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence
— but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary
upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating
magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius…what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he
threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be
surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.”
Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed,
Voldemort could be killed?”
“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man
with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged
beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and
power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.”
“But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.
“Yes, you have,” said Dumbledore firmly. “You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You
can —”
“I know!” said Harry impatiently. “I can love!” It was only with difficulty that he stopped
himself adding, “Big deal!”
“Yes, Harry, you can love,” said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what
Harry had just refrained from saying. “Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great
and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.”
“So, when the prophecy says that I’ll have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not,’ it just means —
love?” asked Harry, feeling a little let down.
“Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is
only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort
singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made
you the person who would be most dangerous to him!”
“But it comes to the same —”
“No, it doesn’t!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black,
withered hand, he said, “You are setting too much store by the prophecy!”
“But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means —”
“If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have
meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been
fulfilled?”
“But,” said Harry, bewildered, “but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other —”
“Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s
words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious
desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have
given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you see?
Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how
much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many
victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different!
Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he
leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he
handed him uniquely deadly weapons!”
“But —”
“It is essential that you understand this!” said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the
room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. “By
attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front
of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort’s fault that you were able to see into his
thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders,
and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort’s world (which, incidentally, is a gift
any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for
a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort’s followers!”
“Of course I haven’t!” said Harry indignantly. “He killed my mum and dad!”
“You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said Dumbledore loudly. “The only
protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort’s! In spite of all the
temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at
the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s desire, and it showed you
only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea
how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then
what he was dealing with, but he did not!
“But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort’s mind without damage to yourself,
but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not
think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he
never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.”
“But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, “it all comes to the
same thing, doesn’t it? I’ve got to try and kill him, or —”
“Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you’ve got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because
you, yourself, will never rest until you’ve tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment,
that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”
Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of
his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible
deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.
“I’d want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I’d want to do it.”
“Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to
do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal…In other words,
you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort
continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you…which makes it certain, really,
that —”
“That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry. “Yes.”
But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the
difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the
arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose
between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce
pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
SECTUMSEMPRA
Exhausted but delighted with his night’s work, Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that
had happened during next morning’s Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those
nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out
of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemort’s Horcruxes and
Dumbledore’s promise to take Harry along, should he find another one.
“Wow,” said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his
wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what
he was doing. “Wow. You’re actually going to go with Dumbledore…and try and destroy…wow.”
“Ron, you’re making it snow,” said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his
wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender
Brown, Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and
Hermione immediately let go of Rons arm.
“Oh yeah,” said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. “Sorry…looks like we’ve
all got horrible dandruff now…”
He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermiones shoulder. Lavender burst into tears. Ron
looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her.
“We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth, “Last night. When she saw me
coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn’t see you, so she thought it had
just been the two of us.”
“Ah,” said Harry. “Well — you don’t mind it’s over, do you?”
“No,” Ron admitted. “It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish
it.”
“Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. “Well, it was a bad night for romance all
around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.”
Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that, but she could not
possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile and
his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?”
“Oh, something really silly…She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole,
like she couldn’t climb in herself…but they’ve been a bit rocky for ages.”
Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. He certainly looked unhappy.
“Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn’t it?” said Hermione.
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
“The Quidditch team,” said Hermione. “If Ginny and Dean aren’t speaking…”
“Oh — oh yeah,” said Harry.
“Flitwick,” said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way
toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass
flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry’s and Ron’s were still murky
brown.
“Now, now, boys,” squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. “A little less talk, a little more
action…Let me see you try…”
Together they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their
flasks. Harry’s vinegar turned to ice; Rons flask exploded.
“Yes…for homework,” said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling
shards of glass out of the top of his hat, “practice.”
They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room
together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender,
and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said,
“It’s a nice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside
Harry’s brain:
She’s Rons sister.
But she’s ditched Dean!
She’s still Rons sister.
I’m his best mate!
That’ll make it worse.
If I talked to him first —
He’d hit you.
What if I don’t care?
He’s your best mate!
Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common
room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until
Hermione cried, “Katie! You’re back! Are you okay?”
Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her
jubilant friends.
“I’m really well!” she said happily. “They let me out of St. Mungos on Monday, I had a couple
of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just telling
me about McLaggen and the last match, Harry…”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “well, now you’re back and Ron’s fit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing
Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie…”
He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his
brain. He dropped his voice as Katie’s friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were
late for Transfiguration.
“…that necklace…can you remember who gave it to you now?”
“No,” said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. “Everyone’s been asking me, but I haven’t got a
clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies’ in the Three Broomsticks.”
“You definitely went into the bathroom, then?” said Hermione.
“Well, I know I pushed open the door,” said Katie, “so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was
standing just behind it. After that, my memory’s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo’s.
Listen, I’d better go, I wouldn’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day
back…”
She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and
Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them.
“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,” said Hermione, “to be in
the ladies’ bathroom.”
“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said Harry. “Don’t forget, there was a
cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got stolen…”
In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past, all transformed into
girls.
“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said Harry, “and have a go at the Room of
Requirement again.”
“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said Hermione flatly, putting down the copy of
Spellmans Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. “Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The
situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment,
though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion! You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore
takes you along with him…” She dropped her voice to a whisper.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione. “It’d be great to have a
stock of it…Have a look in the book…”
Harry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bap, and looked up Felix Felicis.
“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. “And it
takes six months…You’ve got to let it stew…”
“Typical,” said Ron.
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down;
turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned “For Enemies,” that he had marked a few
weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it
around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind
him unawares.
The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean
Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow
stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct
feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back.
The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team
was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying
extremely well.
Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life
and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal
posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being
knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an
innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice
because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.
The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-
Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron’s
expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base
treachery if Harry so much as held her hand…
Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from
practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get
her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron
would not be around — but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice
Harry considered asking for Hermione’s help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug
look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny
or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn’t do it,
somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she
was too popular for her own good.
All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day,
for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, “tweaking the circumstances”? The balmy days slid
gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry’s shoulder every time he saw Ginny.
Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that
nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to
leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the
final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time
and had little thought for anything else.
Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running
extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was
still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and
yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they
won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a
hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they
would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had
been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.
The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting
to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being
rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all
the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had
become inextricably linked in Harry’s mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could
not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a
nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis.
In the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out
what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder’s Map,
and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time
within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the
Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he
reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless.
A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner
alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet
again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she
might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his
usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder’s Map as he went. For a
moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of
Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy’s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the
floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle.
Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor.
The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed
down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear
against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.
Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink,
his white-blond head bowed.
“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of the cubicles. “Don’t…tell me what’s
wrong…I can help you…”
“No one can help me,” said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. “I can’t do it…I can’t…It
won’t work…and unless I do it soon…he says he’ll kill me…”
And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was
crying — actually crying — tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped
and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into flu-cracked mirror and saw Harry staring
at him over his shoulder.
Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy’s hex
missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways,
thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for
another —
“No! No! Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room.
“Stop! STOP!”
There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse
that backfired off the wall behind Malfoy’s ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myr-tle,
who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted,
cried, “Cruci —”
“SECTUMSEMPRA!” bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.
Blood spurted from Malfoy’s face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible
sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his
wand falling from his limp right hand.
“No —” gasped Harry.
Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now
shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest.
“No — I didn’t —”
Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking
uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream:
“MURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!”
The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room,
his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over
the deep wounds Harry’s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song.
The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy’s face and repeated his spell.
Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.
Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in
blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had
performed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy into a standing position.
“You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany
immediately we might avoid even that…Come…”
He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury,
“And you, Potter…You wait here for me.”
It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down
at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not
even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with
increasingly evident enjoyment.
Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind
him.
“Go,” he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence
behind her.
“I didn’t mean it to happen,” said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. “I
didn’t know what that spell did.”
But Snape ignored this. “Apparently I underestimated you, Potter,” he said quietly. “Who would
have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?”
“I — read about it somewhere.”
“Where?”
“It was — a library book,” Harry invented wildly. “I can’t remember what it was call —”
“Liar,” said Snape. Harry’s throat went dry. He knew what Snape was going to do and he had
never been able to prevent it…
The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block out all thought, but try
as he might, the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront
of his mind.
And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He
stared into Snape’s black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but —
“Bring me your schoolbag,” said Snape softly, “and all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring
them to me here. Now!”
There was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom. Once in
the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walking the other
way; they gaped at him, drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at
him as he ran past.
He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince
been thinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it?
Would he tell Slughorn — Harry’s stomach churned — how Harry had been achieving such good
results in Potions all year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so
much…the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? Harry could not let it happen…He
could not…
“Where’ve you —? Why are you soaking —? Is that blood.” Ron was standing at the top of the
stairs, looking bewildered at, the sight of Harry.
“I need your book,” Harry panted. “Your Potions book. Quick…give it to me…”
“But what about the Half-Blood —”
“I’ll explain later!”
Ron pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and handed it over; Harry
sprinted off past him and back to the common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the
amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the
portrait hole, and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor.
He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk.
I need a place to hide my book…I need a place to hide my book…I need a place to hide my book…
Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. When he opened his
eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung him
self inside, and slammed it shut.
He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he
could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a
large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city
with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts
inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by tetering piles of broken and damaged
furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-
proud house-elves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or
stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to
hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of
congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles
whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe.
Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He
turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing
Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard
that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard’s
creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since
died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the Half-Blood Princes book behind the cage and
slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the
clutter…Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an
ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book
was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more
distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to
the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once
back into stone.
Harry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ron’s copy of Advanced
Potion-Making into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out
his hand wordlessly for Harry’s schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest,
and waited.
One by one, Snape extracted Harry’s books and examined them. Finally, the only book left was
the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking.
“This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry, still breathing hard.
“You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry, with a touch more defiance.
“This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?”
“Yes,” said Harry firmly.
“Then why,” asked Snape, “does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front
cover?”
Harry’s heart missed a beat. “That’s my nickname,” he said.
“Your nickname,” repeated Snape.
“Yeah…that’s what my friends call me,” said Harry.
“I understand what a nickname is,” said Snape. The cold, black eyes were boring once more into
Harry’s; he tried not to look into them. Close your mind…Close your mind…But he had never
learned how to do it properly…
“Do you know what I think, Potter?” said Snape, very quietly. “I think that you are a liar and a
cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. What do you
think, Potter?”
“I — I don’t agree, sir,” said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape’s eyes.
“Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,” said Snape. “Ten o’clock Saturday
morning, Potter. My office.”
“But sir…” said Harry, looking up desperately. “Quidditch…the last match of the…”
“Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. “Poor
Gryffindor…fourth place this year, I fear…”
And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror,
feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life.
“I won’t say ‘I told you so,’” said Hermione, an hour later in the common room.
“Leave it, Hermione,” said Ron angrily.
Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron,
Hermione, and Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The
news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every
bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by
Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff
precisely what had happened. Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure
fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he
was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape’s punishment of
detention every Saturday until the end of term.
“I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,” Hermione said, evidently
unable to stop herself. “And I was right, wasn’t I.”
“No, I don’t think you were,” said Harry stubbornly.
He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor
team’s faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst
punishment of all. He could feel Ginny’s eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want
to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on
Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won,
Ginny and Dean would make up during the post-match euphoria…The thought went through
Harry like an icy knife…
“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up for that book when that spell —”
“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry. “The Prince only copied it out! It’s
not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that
had been used against him!”
“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending —“
“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done it, and not just
because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on
Malfoy, but you can’t blame the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was
just making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else…”
“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back —?”
“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without the Prince I’d never have
won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”
“— got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said Hermione nastily.
“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. “By
the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had
something good up his sleeve!”
“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said Hermione, clearly stung. “But you can’t call
that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it’s landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing
what this has done to your chances in the match —”
“Oh, don’t start acting as though you understand Quidditch,” snapped Ginny, “you’ll only
embarrass yourself.”
Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were
now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry,
then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, little though he knew he
deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the
rest of the evening.
His lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to
mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got
himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have
told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking
down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn
away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and
hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk
until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to
hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan.
“Ah, Potter,” said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly
familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as
ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls.
Ominously, there were many cob-webbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed
to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them.
“Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,” said Snape softly. “They
are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown
faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and
punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes.
You will not use magic.”
“Right, Professor,” said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three
syllables.
“I thought you could start,” said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, “with boxes one thousand
and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should
add interest to the task. Here, you see…”
He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, “‘James Potter and
Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubreys head twice normal size.
Double detention.’” Snape sneered. “It must be such a comforting thing that, though they are gone, a
record of their great achievements remains.”
Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent
himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.
It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned)
with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius’s names, usually
coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and
Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered
what was going on outside, where the match would have just started…Ginny playing Seeker against
Cho…
Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half
as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been
here for only half an hour…an hour…an hour and a half…
Harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not
spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one.
“I think that will do,” he said coldly. “Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten
o’clock next Saturday.”
“Yes, sir.”
Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could
change his mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch,
but all was quiet…It was over, then…
He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether
Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common
room.
“Quid agis?” he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside.
Her expression was unreadable as she replied, “You’ll see.”
And she swung forward.
A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream
at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room.
“We won!” yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. “We won!
Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!”
Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her
face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without
worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.
After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit
days — they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and
there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny’s head to see Dean
Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw
something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry’s eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still
clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For
a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry
understood to mean, Well — if you must.
The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly
out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which — if they had
time — they might discuss the match.
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
THE SEER OVERHEARD
The fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number
of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over
the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something
that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than
because he had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark magic.
“You’d think people had better things to gossip about,” said Ginny, as she sat on the common-
room floor, leaning against Harry’s legs and reading the Daily Prophet. “Three Dementor attacks in a
week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a Hippogriff tattooed across your
chest.”
Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.
“What did you tell her?”
“I told her it’s a Hungarian Horntail,” said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. “Much
more macho.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning. “And what did you tell her Ron’s got?”
“A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.”
Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing.
“Watch it,” he said, pointing wamingly at Harry and Ginny. “Just because I’ve given my
permission doesn’t mean I can’t withdraw it —”
“Your permission”, scoffed Ginny. “Since when did you give me permission to do anything?
Anyway, you said yourself you’d rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean.”
“Yeah, I would,” said Ron grudgingly. “And just as long as you don’t start snogging each other
in public —”
“You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrashing around like a pair of eels all over
the place?” demanded Ginny.
But Ron’s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginny’s
time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginny’s O.W.L.s were approaching and she was
therefore forced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to
the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his
Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake
with Ginny at lunch-time, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an
unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.
“I want to talk to you, Harry.”
“What about?” said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, Hermione had told him off for
distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations.
“The so-called Half-Blood Prince.”
“Oh, not again,” he groaned. “Will you please drop it? “
He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his
performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had
jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given
up hope of laying hands on the Prince’s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while
Snape remained on the lookout.
“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until you’ve heard me out. Now, I’ve been trying
to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells -”
“He didn’t make a hobby of it -”
“He, he - who says it’s a he?”
“We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly. “Prince, Hermione, Prince!”
“Right!” said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of
newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry. “Look at that!
Look at the picture!”
Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed
with age; Ron leaned over for a look, too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She
was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face.
Underneath the photograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones
Team.
“So?” said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather
dull story about inter-school competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.”
They looked at each other and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out
laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think she was the Half-Blood…? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the wizarding world! It’s either a
nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn’t
it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard whose surname was “Prince”, and her mother was a
Muggle, then that would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione…”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,” said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?” said Harry,
stung by this. “It’s the way he writes. I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t
got anything to do with it. Where did you get this, anyway?”
“The library,” said Hermione, predictably. “There’s a whole collection of old Prophets up there.
Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.”
“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably.
“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” she shot at him, as she reached the
portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!”
Harry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky.
“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,” said Ron, returning to his copy of
One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.
“You don’t think I’m mad, wanting that book back, do you?”
“Course not,” said Ron robustly. “He was a genius, the Prince. Anyway…without his bezoar
tip…” he drew his finger significantly across his own throat, “I wouldn’t be here to discuss it, would
I? I mean, I’m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great -”
“Nor am I,” said Harry quickly.
“But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in no time.”
“Yeah,” said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his conscience squirmed slightly all the
same. “Thanks to Snape…”
“You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?” Ron continued.
“Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,’“sighed Harry. “And he’s hinting
now that if I don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we’ll carry on next year.”
He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited
time he could have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether
Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed
asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.
Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes,
who was holding out a scroll of parchment.
“Thanks, Jimmy…hey, it’s from Dumbledore!” said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment
and scanning it. “He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can!”
They stared at each other.
“Blimey,” whispered Ron. “You don’t reckon…he hasn’t found…?”
“Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said Harry, jumping to his feet.
He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing
nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a
routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry’s defensive jinx. Once Peeves had
vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people
had already returned to their common rooms.
And then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening.
“How - dare - you - aaaaargh!”
The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted towards it, his wand at the ready,
hurtled round another corner and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head
covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.
“Professor —”
Harry hurried forwards and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads
had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccoughed loudly, patted her hair and pulled herself up
on Harry’s helping arm.
“What happened, Professor?”
“You may well ask!” she said shrilly. “I was strolling along, brooding upon certain Dark portents
happen to have glimpsed…”
But Harry was not paying much attention. He had just noticed where they were standing: there
on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and, on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of
stone wall that concealed —
“Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement?”
“…omens I have been vouchsafed — what?”
She looked suddenly shifty.
“The Room of Requirement,” repeated Harry. “Were you trying to get in there?”
“I — well — I didn’t know students knew about -”
“Not all of them do,” said Harry. “But what happened? You screamed…it sounded as though
you were hurt…”
“I — well,” said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring
down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. “I wished to — ah — deposit certain – um - personal
items in the Room…” And she muttered something about ‘nasty accusations’.
“Right,” said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. “But you couldn’t get in and hide
them?”
He found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide
the Half-Blood Prince’s book.
“Oh, I got in all right,” said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. “But there was somebody
already in there.”
“Somebody in —? Who?”demanded Harry. “Who was in there?”
“Who? I have no idea,” said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in
Harry’s voice. “I walked into the Room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all
my years of hiding — of using the Room, I mean.”
“A voice? Saying what? “
“I don’t know that it was saying anything,” said Professor Trelawney. “It was…whooping.”
“Whooping?”
“Gleefully,” she said, nodding.
Harry stared at her.
“Was it male or female?”
“I would hazard a guess at male,” said Professor Trelawney.
“And it sounded happy?”
“Very happy,” said Professor Trelawney sniffily.
“As though it was celebrating?”
“Most definitely.”
“And then —?”
“And then I called out, ‘Who’s there?’”
“You couldn’t have found out who it was without asking?” Harry asked her, slightly frustrated.
“The Inner Eye,” said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many
strands of glittering beads, “was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping
voices.”
“Right,” said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney’s Inner Eye all too often
before. “And did the voice say who was there?”
“No, it did not,” she said. “Everything went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was being
hurled headfirst out of the Room!”
“And you didn’t see that coming?” said Harry, unable to help himself.
“No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch —” She stopped and glared at him suspiciously.
“I think you’d better tell Professor Dumbledore,” said Harry. “He ought to know Malfoy’s
celebrating — I mean, that someone threw you out of the Room.”
To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty.
“The Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,” she said coldly. “I
am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore
the warnings the cards show —”
Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harry’s wrist.
“Again and again, no matter how I lay them out —”
And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls.
“— the lightning-struck tower,” she whispered. “Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the
time…”
“Right,” said Harry again. “Well…I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and
everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room…”
“You think so?” Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry
could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure.
“I’m going to see him right now,” said Harry. “I’ve got a meeting with him. We could go
together.”
“Oh, well, in that case,” said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her
sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a
nearby niche.
“I miss having you in my classes, Harry,” she said soulfully, as they set off together. “You were
never much of a Seer…but you were a wonderful Object…”
Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney’s continual
predictions of doom.
“I am afraid,” she went on, “that the nag — I’m sorry, the centaur — knows nothing of
cartomancy. I asked him — one Seer to another — had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of
coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!”
Her voice rose rather hysterically and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the
bottles had been left behind.
“Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother’s
gift. Those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such
people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me
all these years, had I not proved myself to him?”
Harry mumbled something indistinct.
“I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,” went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty
tones. “He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed…I was staying at the Hog’s Head,
which I do not advise, incidentally — bed bugs, dear boy — but funds were low. Dumbledore did
me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn. He questioned me…I must confess that,
at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed towards Divination…and I remember I was starting to feel
a little odd, I had not eaten much that day…but then…”
And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened
then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the
prophecy about him and Voldemort.
“…but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!’
“What?”
“Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather
uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the
stairs, although I’m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on
my interview with Dumbledore — you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt
hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give
me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast
between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young
man who was prepared to listen at keyholes — Harry, dear?”
She looked back over her shoulder, having only just realized that Harry was no longer with her;
he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.
“Harry?” she repeated uncertainly.
Perhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing
stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the
information that had been kept from him for so long…
It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the
prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily
and James and their son…
Nothing else mattered to Harry just now.
“Harry?” said Professor Trelawney again. “Harry — I thought we were going to see the
Headmaster together?”
“You stay here,” said Harry through numb lips.
“But, dear…I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of —”
“You stay here!” Harry repeated angrily.
She looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledore’s corridor, where the
lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral
staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore’s door, he hammered; and the
calm voice answered ‘Enter’ after Harry had already flung himself into the room.
Fawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the
sunset beyond the window. Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a
long, black travelling cloak in his arms.
“Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.”
For a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the conversation with Trelawney had driven
everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly.
“Come…with you…?”
“Only if you wish it, of course.”
“If I…”
And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledore’s office in the first
place.
“You’ve found one? You’ve found a Horcrux?”
“I believe so.”
Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: for several moments, Harry could not speak.
“It is natural to be afraid,” said Dumbledore.
“I’m not scared!” said Harry at once, and it was perfectly true; fear was one emotion he was not
feeling at all. “Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?”
“I am not sure which it is — though I think we can rule out the snake — but I believe it to be
hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very
long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorised two children from his orphanage on their
annual trip; you remember?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “How is it protected?”
“I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.” Dumbledore hesitated, then said,
“Harry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be
very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.”
“I’m coming,” said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking. Boiling with anger
at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few
minutes. This seemed to show on Harry’s face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window, and
looked more closely at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.
“What has happened to you?”
“Nothing,” lied Harry promptly.
“What has upset you?”
“I’m not upset.”
“Harry, you were never a good Occlumens —”
The word was the spark that ignited Harry’s fury.
“Snape!” he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. “Snape’s what’s
happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door,
Trelawney told me!”
Dumbledore’s expression did not change, but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody
tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing.
“When did you find out about this?” he asked at last.
“Just now!” said Many, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then,
suddenly, he could not stop himself. “AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD
VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!”
Breathing hard as though he were fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had
not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and
exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and
storm at Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted
to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore
would not take him along unless he mastered his anger…
“Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Please listen to me.”
It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting
his lip, and looked into Dumbledore’s lined face.
“Professor Snape made a terrible —”
“Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!”
“Please let me finish.” Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly, then went on.
“Professor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Voldemort’s employ on the night he
heard the first half of Professor Trelawney’s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what
he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know — he had no possible
way of knowing — which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onwards, or that the parents he
would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your
mother and father —”
Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.
“He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven’t you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape
hates tend to end up dead?”
“You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realized how Lord Voldemort
had interpreted the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason
that he returned —”
“But he’s a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir?” said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the
effort of keeping it steady. “And isn’t Voldemort convinced that Snape’s on his side, even now?
Professor…how can you be sure Snape’s on our side?”
Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his
mind about something. At last he said, “I am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.”
Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work.
“Well, I don’t!” he said, as loudly as before. “He’s up to something with Draco Malfoy right
now, right under your nose, and you still —”
“We have discussed this, Harry,” said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again. “I have
told you my views.”
“You’re leaving the school tonight and I’ll bet you haven’t even considered that Snape and
Malfoy might decide to —”
“To what?” asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. “What is it that you suspect them of doing,
precisely?”
“I…they’re up to something!” said Harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it. “Professor
Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard
Malfoy whooping, celebrating! He’s trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me
he’s fixed it at last and you’re about to just walk out of school without —”
“Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew
that he had finally crossed some invisible line. “Do you think that I have once left the school
unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be
additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students
seriously, Harry.”
“I didn’t —” mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him.
“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.”
Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of
accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, “Do you wish to come with me tonight?”
“Yes,” said Harry at once.
“Very well, then: listen.”
Dumbledore drew himself up to his full height.
“I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once,
and without question.”
“Of course.”
“Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow even such orders as ‘run’, ‘hide’
or ‘go back’. Do I have your word?”
“I - yes, of course.”
“If I tell you to hide, you will do so?”
“Yes.”
“If I tell you to flee, you will obey?”
“Yes.”
“If I tell you to leave me, and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?”
“I —”
“Harry?”
They looked at each other for a moment.
“Yes, sir.”
“Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in
five minutes’ time.”
Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby-red glare
along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was
oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do.
Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. “What does
Dumbledore want?” Hermione said at once. “Harry, are you okay?” she added anxiously.
“I’m fine,” said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory,
where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder’s Map and a pair of balled-up socks.
Then he stepped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and
Hermione sat, looking stunned.
“I haven’t got much time,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore thinks I’m getting my Invisibility
Cloak. Listen…”
Quickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Hermione’s
gasps of horror or for Ron’s hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves
later.
“…so you see what this means?” Harry finished at a gallop. “Dumbledore won’t be here tonight,
so Malfoy’s going to have another clear shot at whatever he’s up to. No, listen to me!” he hissed
angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. “I know it was Malfoy
celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here —” He shoved the Marauder’s Map into Hermione’s
hand. “You’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to watch Snape, too. Use anyone else who you can
rustle up from the DA. Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says
he’s put extra protection in the school, but if Snape’s involved, he’ll know what Dumbledore’s
protection is, and how to avoid it — but he won’t be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?”
“Harry —” began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear.
“I haven’t got time to argue,” said Harry curtly. “Take this as well —” He thrust the socks into
Ron’s hands.
“Thanks,” said Ron. “Er — why do I need socks?”
“You need what’s wrapped in them, it’s the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny
too. Say goodbye to her from me. I’d better go, Dumbledore’s waiting —”
“No!” said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking
awestruck. “We don’t want it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to be facing?”
“I’Il be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore,” said Harry. “I want to know you lot are okay…don’t
look like that, Hermione, I’ll see you later…”
And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall.
Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out
on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side.
“I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,” said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had
thrown it on before saying, “Very good. Shall we go?”
Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the
still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still panting and sweating
rather a lot.
“But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?” Harry asked, his mind on
Malfoy and Snape.
“That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,” said Dumbledore lightly. “I sometimes offer
Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog’s Head…or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of
disguising one’s true destination.”
They made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight. The air was full of the smells of
warm grass, lake water and wood smoke from Hagrid’s cabin. It was difficult to believe that they
were heading for anything dangerous or frightening.
“Professor,” said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, “will we
be Apparating?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “You can Apparate now, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “but I haven’t got a licence.”
He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from
where he was supposed to go?
“No matter,” said Dumbledore, “I can assist you again.”
They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended
fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights
twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous
shouting.
“— and stay out!” shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. “Oh,
hello, Albus…you’re out late”
“Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening…forgive me, I’m off to the Hog’s Head…no offence,
but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight…”
A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog’s Head’s sign creaked a
little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be
completely empty.
“It will not be necessary for us to enter,” muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. “As long as
nobody sees us go…now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I
am merely guiding you. On the count of three — one…two…three…”
Harry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a
thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being com-pressed almost past
endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst
open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
THE CAVE
Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked
out at moon-lit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water
foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind
them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which
Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at
some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or
sweep of grass or sand.
“What do you think?” asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harry’s opinion on
whether it was a good site for a picnic.
“They brought the kids from the orphanage here?” asked Harry, who could not imagine a less
cozy spot for a day trip.
“Not here, precisely,” said Dumbledore. “There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs
behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I
think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could
reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the
cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would
have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the
pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don’t you?”
Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps.
“But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on. Come.”
Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made
footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a
treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The
lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face.
“Lumos,” said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of
golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the
black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. “You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his
wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. “You will not
object to getting a little wet?”
“No,” said Harry.
“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the
plunge.”
And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed
in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit
wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed.
The water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down.
Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the
shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff.
The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at
high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light
of Dumbledore’s wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it
extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore’s wake, the tips of his benumbed
fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.
Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming.
When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them,
water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and
freezing air.
Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on
the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.
“Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore.
“How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper.
“It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply.
Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness
or to the same awareness of enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the
spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see.
“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” said Dumbledore after a moment or two.
“We need to penetrate the inner place…Now it is Lord Voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way,
rather than those nature made…”
Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips,
murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked
right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing,
running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand
pressed flat against the wall.
“Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.”
Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this,
simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more
often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.
Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment,
an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the
crack.
“You’ve d-done it!” said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips
the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around.
“Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harry’s
clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.
“Thank you,” said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to
the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as
though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want
to break Dumbledores concentration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, “Oh,
surely not. So crude.”
“What is it, Professor?”
“I rather think,” said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out
a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, “that we are required to make
payment to pass.”
“Payment?” said Harry. “You’ve got to give the door something?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Blood, if I am not much mistaken.”
“Blood?”
“I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though
Voldemort had fallen short of higher standards Dumbledore expected. “The idea, as I am sure you
will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him — or herself to enter. Once again, Lord
Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.”
“Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it…” said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be
keen for more.
“Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,” said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes
and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.
“Professor!” protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife. “I’ll do it, I’m -”
He did not know what he was going to say — younger, fitter?
But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face
was peppered with dark, glistening drops.
“You are very kind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut
he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy’s wound,
“But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn’t it?”
The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not
fade away: The blood-spattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed
total darkness. “After me, I think,” said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with
Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went.
An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that
Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight.
A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in
the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only
things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry
would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to
me.”
He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps
made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on
they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the
boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious
greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving.
“Professor?” he said finally. “Do you think the Horcrux is here?”
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, I’m sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?”
“We couldn’t…we couldn’t just try a Summoning Charm?” Harry said, sure that it was a stupid
suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as
soon as possible.
“Certainly we could,” said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into
him. “Why don’t you do it?”
“Me? Oh…okay…” Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand
aloft, “Accio Horcrux!”
With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some
twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash
that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the
wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.
“What was that?”
“Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.”
Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The
ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry’s heart, however, was still pounding.
“Did you think that would happen, sir?”
“I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the
Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are
facing.”
“But we don’t know what the thing was,” said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water.
“What the things are, you mean,” said Dumbledore. “I doubt very much that there is only one
of them. Shall we walk on?”
“Professor?”
“Yes, Harry?”
“Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?”
“Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.”
“You don’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?”
“Oh no…I think the Horcrux is in the middle.” And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty
green light in the center of the lake.
“So we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?”
“Yes, I think so.” Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant
serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites…
“Aha,” said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a
moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly
around his upper arm, pulling him back. “So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back
against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.”
Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other
bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it.
This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though
expecting to find and grip something invisible.
“Oho,” said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something
Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of
Dumbledore’s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in
midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.
Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of
the water into Dumbledore’s clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide
through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off
the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly
prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple,
toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.
“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in astonishment.
“Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump,
“sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.”
“Is…is this boat safe?”
“Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the
wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his
Horcrux.”
“So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort’s boat?”
“I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord
Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.”
“But why have they let us?” asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising
out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.
“Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have
been able to find the boat,” said Dumbledore. “I think he would have been prepared to risk what
was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he
had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he was
right.”
Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. “It doesn’t look like it was built for
two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?”
Dumbledore chuckled. “Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount
of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon
this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.”
“But then —?”
“I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would
never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will
register compared to mine.”
These words did nothing to raise Harry’s morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added,
“Voldemort’s mistake, Harry, Voldemort’s mistake…Age is foolish and forgetful when it
underestimates youth…Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.”
Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too,
coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit,
but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once. There was
no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat’s prow cleaving the water; it moved without their
help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they
could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no
waves.
Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the
black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the
dark mirror…
And then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface.
“Professor!” he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water.
“Harry?”
“I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!”
“Yes, I am sure you did,” said Dumbledore calmly.
Harry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his
throat.
“So that thing that jumped out of the water —?”
But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh
patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his
open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke.
“There are bodies in here!” said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most
unlike his own.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore placidly, “but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.”
“At the moment?” Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore.
“Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,” said Dumbledore. “There is nothing to
be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord
Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of
wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.”
Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies
floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they
were not dangerous.
“But one of them jumped,” he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore’s.
“When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less
peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth,
which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,” Dumbledore added with
a smile, in response to Harry’s bewildered expression.
“Oh…right…” said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward
which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The
great black lake, teeming with the dead…It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor
Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis…He suddenly wished he had said a
better good-bye to them…and he hadn’t seen Ginny at all…
“Nearly there,” said Dumbledore cheerfully.
Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat
had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he
raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center
of the lake.
“Careful not to touch the water,” said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat.
The island was no larger than Dumbledore’s office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood
nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to.
Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light
was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal.
Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it.
The basin was full of an emerald liq-uid emitting that phosphorescent glow.
“What is it?” asked Harry quietly.
“I am not sure,” said Dumbledore. “Something more worrisome than blood and bodies,
however.”
Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand, and stretched out the
tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion.
“Sir, no, don’t touch —!”
“I cannot touch,” said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. “See? I cannot approach any nearer than
this. You try.”
Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an
invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his
fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air.
“Out of the way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated
movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except
perhaps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked,
but after a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside
down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But how to reach it? This potion cannot be
penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured,
Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then
caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.”
“But what if — what if it kills you?”
“Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,” said Dumbledore easily. “Lord Voldemort would not
want to kill the person who reached this island.”
Harry couldn’t believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore’s insane determination to see good in
everyone?
“Sir,” said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, “sir, this is Voldemort we’re —”
“I’m sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to immediately kill the person who
reached this island,” Dumbledore corrected himself. “He would want to keep them alive long
enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and, most
importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord
Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.”
Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning
slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard.
“Undoubtedly,” he said, finally, “this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the
Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am
distracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job
to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You
understand?”
Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not
speak. Was this why he had been invited along — so that he could forcefeed Dumbledore a potion
that might cause him unendurable pain?
“You remember,” said Dumbledore, “the condition on which I brought you with me?”
Harry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the
basin.
“But what if —?”
“You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?”
“Yes, but —”
“I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “but —”
“Well, then,” said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty
goblet, “you have my orders.”
“Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked Harry desperately.
“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,” said Dumbledore. “Once
and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep
drinking?”
“Couldn’t —?”
“Do I have it?”
“But —”
“Your word, Harry.”
“I — all right, but —”
Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the
potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the
goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim,
Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth.
“Your good health, Harry.”
And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so
hard that his fingertips were numb.
“Professor?” he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. “How do you feel?”
Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain.
Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more.
In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. Then, halfway through the fourth
goblet, he staggered and fell forward against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy.
“Professor Dumbledore?” said Harry, his voice strained. “Can you hear me?”
Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep, but
dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from
it. Harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady.
“Professor, can you hear me?” he repeated loudly, his voice echoing around the cavern.
Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize, for he had never heard
Dumbledore frightened like this.
“I don’t want…Don’t make me…”
Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon
spectacles, and did not know what to do.
“…don’t like…want to stop…” moaned Dumbledore.
“You…you can’t stop, Professor,” said Harry. “You’ve got to keep drinking, remember? You told
me you had to keep drinking. Here…”
Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back toward
Dumbledore’s mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside.
“No…” he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him. “I
don’t want to…I don’t want to…Let me go…”
“It’s all right, Professor,” said Harry, his hand shaking. “Its all right, I’m here —”
“Make it stop, make it stop,” moaned Dumbledore.
“Yes…yes, this’ll make it stop,” lied Harry. He tipped the contents of the goblet into
Dumbledore’s open mouth.
Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black
water.
“No, no, no, no, I can’t, I can’t, don’t make me, I don’t want to…”
“It’s all right, Professor, it’s all right!” said Harry loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could
hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion; the basin was now half empty. “Nothing’s happening
to you, you’re safe, it isn’t real, I swear it isn’t real — take this, now, take this…”
And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an antidote Harry offered him, but upon
draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably.
“It’s all my fault, all my fault,” he sobbed. “Please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please
make it stop and I’ll never, never again…”
“This will make it stop, Professor,” Harry said, his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass
of potion into Dumbledore’s mouth.
Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand
almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harry’s trembling hands as he moaned, “Don’t hurt them,
don’t hurt them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead…”
“Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said Harry desperately, and once again
Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from
head to foot.
And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the ground, while Harry
filled the ninth goblet.
“Please, please, please, no…not that, not that, I’ll do anything…”
“Just drink, Professor, just drink…”
Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as
though his insides were on fire. “No more, please, no more…”
Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin.
“We’re nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it…”
He supported Dumbledore’s shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was
on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than
ever, “I want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!”
“Drink this, Professor. Drink this…”
Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, “KILL ME!”
“This — this one will!” gasped Harry. “Just drink this…It’ll be over…all over!”
Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp,
rolled over onto his face.
“No!” shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into
the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back;
Dumbledore’s glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. “No.” said Harry, shaking
Dumbledore, “no, you’re not dead, you said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — Rennervate!” he
cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledores chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened.
“Rennervate — sir — please —”
Dumbledore’s eyelids flickered; Harry’s heart lept.
“Sir, are you —?”
“Water,” croaked Dumbledore.
“Water,” panted Harry. “Yes —”
He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he barely registered the
golden locket lying curled beneath it.
“Aguamenti!” he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.
The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his
head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.
“But I had some — wait — Aguamenti!” said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once
more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledores mouth, the
water vanished again.
“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore
could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded
agoniz-ing. “Aguamenti — Aguamenti — AGUAMENTI!”
The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledores breathing was fading. His
brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort
had planned it so…
He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it
up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.
“Sir — here!” Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over
Dumbledore’s face.
It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the
lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it
belonged was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The surface of the lake was no longer
mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were
emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were
moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water.
“Petrificus Totalus!” yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island
as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm. It released him, falling backward into the
water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the
rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing
waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.
“Petrificus Totalus!” Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air;
six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. “Impedimenta! Incarcerous!”
A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock
behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand,
Harry yelled, “Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!”
But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill:
They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away
still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left
the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he
knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of
a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soul…
But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the
rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through
the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell,
grazing his arms, then scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around.
Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too,
the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames,
like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting,
blindly, to escape the fire in which they were enclosed…
Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his
robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi
seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of
fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge,
where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.
Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to
climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into
maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his
seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black
water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming
below them did not dare resurface.
“Sir,” panted Harry, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they were coming at me and I panicked -”
“Quite understandable,” murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice
was.
They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help
Dumbledore. The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of
fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water
once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great
sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.
“I am weak…” he said.
“Don’t worry, sir,” said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore’s extreme pallor and by his
air of exhaustion. “Don’t worry, I’ll get us back…Lean on me, sir…”
And pulling Dumbledore’s uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster
back around the lake, bearing most of his weight.
“The protection was…after all…well-designed,” said Dumbledore faintly. “One alone could not
have done it…You did well, very well, Harry…”
“Don’t talk now,” said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledore’s voice had become, how much
his feet dragged. “Save your energy, sir…We’ll soon be out of here…”
“The archway will have sealed again…My knife…” ‘
“There’s no need, I got cut on the rock,” said Harry firmly. “Just tell me where…”
“Here…”
Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having re-ceived its tribute of blood, the
archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into
the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.
“It’s going to be all right, sir,” Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore’s
silence than he had been by his weakened voice. “We’re nearly there…I can Apparate us both
back…Don’t worry…”
“I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing
water. “I am with you.”
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
THE LIGHTNING-STRUCK TOWER
Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder
and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore’s weight still upon him, Harry concentrated
harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping
Dumbledore’s arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible
compression.
He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He
and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade.
For one horrible moment Harry’s imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him
around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that noth-ing was stirring; all was still, the
darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.
“We did it, Professor!” Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realized that he had a
searing stitch in his chest. “We did it! We got the Horcrux!”
Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition
had thrown Dumbledore off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant
light of a streetlamp.
“Sir, are you all right?”
“I’ve been better,” said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. “That
potion…was no health drink…”
And to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank on to the ground.
“Sir — it’s okay, sir, you’re going to be all right, don’t worry -”
He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think
was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing.
“We need to get you up to the school, sir…Madam Pomfrey…”
“No,” said Dumbledore. “It is…Professor Snape whom I need…but I do not think…I can walk
very far just yet…”
“Right — sir, listen — I’m going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay — then I can run
and get Madam —”
“Severus,” said Dumbledore clearly. “I need Severus…”
“All right then, Snape — but I’m going to have to leave you for a moment so I can —”
Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard running footsteps. His heart leapt:
somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help — and looking around he saw Madam
Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk
dressing-gown embroidered with dragons.
“I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I
couldn’t think what to — but what’s wrong with Albus?”
She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at Dumbledore.
“He’s hurt,” said Harry. “Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go
up to the school and get help for him?”
“You can’t go up there alone! Don’t you realize — haven’t you seen —?”
“If you help me support him,” said Harry, not listening to her, “I think we can get him inside — ”
“What has happened?” asked Dumbledore. “Rosmerta, what’s wrong?”
“The — the Dark Mark, Albus.”
And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of
the words…he turned and looked.
There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue,
the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building…wherever they had
murdered…
“When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harry’s
shoulder as he struggled to his feet.
“Must have been minutes ago, it wasn’t there when I put the cat out, but when I got upstairs —”
“We need to return to the castle at once,” said Dumbledore. “Rosmerta,” and though he
staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation, “we need transport - brooms -”
“I’ve got a couple behind the bar,” she said, looking very frightened. “Shall I run and fetch —?”
“No, Harry can do it.”
Harry raised his wand at once.
“Accio Rosmerta’s brooms.”
A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had
shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry’s side, where they stopped dead,
quivering slightly, at waist height.
“Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,” said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom
nearest him. “It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong…Harry,
put on your Invisibility Cloak.”
Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom;
Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off
from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at
Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted
upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark,
his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the
skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other
discomfort from his mind…
How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Ginny’s luck run out by now? Was it
one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some
other member of the DA? And if it was…he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors,
he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds…would he be responsible, again, for the death of
a friend?
As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over
the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He
thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the
boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set
around the castle, so that they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the
Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?
Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed
next to him seconds later and looked around.
The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was
closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.
“What does it mean?” Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpent’s
tongue glinting evilly above them. “Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been — Professor?”
In the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumbledore clutching at his chest with his
blackened hand.
“Go and wake Severus,” said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. “Tell him what has happened and
bring him to me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody else and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait
here.”
“But —”
“You swore to obey me, Harry — go!”
Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but his hand had only just closed
upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round
at Dumbledore, who gestured to him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.
The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: “Expelliarmus!”
Harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the
Tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand
how it had happened — Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm —
Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore’s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the
ramparts and understood…Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had
taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.
Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic
or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, “Good evening, Draco.”
Malfoy stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone.
His eyes fell upon the second broom.
“Who else is here?”
“A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?”
Harry saw Malfoy’s pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark.
“No,” he said. “I’ve got back-up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.”
“Well, well,” said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework
project. “Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?”
“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who was panting. “Right under your nose and you never realized!”
“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “Yet…forgive me…where are they now? You seem
unsupported.”
“They met some of your guard. They’re having a fight down below. They won’t be long…I
came on ahead. I - I’ve got a job to do.”
“Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,” said Dumbledore softly.
There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralyzed body, staring at
the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of
him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who, incredibly, smiled.
“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.”
“How do you know?” said Malfoy at once.
He seemed to realize how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Mark’s
greenish light.
“You don’t know what I’m capable of,” said Malfoy more forcefully, “you don’t know what I’ve
done!”
“Oh, yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly. “You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley.
You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they
have been feeble attempts…so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really
in it…”
“It has been in it!” said Malfoy vehemently. “I’ve been working on it all year, and tonight—”
Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and
glanced over his shoulder.
“Somebody is putting up a good fight,” said Dumbledore conversationally. “But you were
saying…yes, you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought
impossible…how did you do it?”
But Malfoy said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed
almost as paralysed as Harry was.
“Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,” suggested Dumbledore. “What if your backup
has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realized, there are members of the Order of the
Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you don’t really need help…I have no wand at the
moment…I cannot defend myself.”
Malfoy merely stared at him.
“I see,” said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke. “You are afraid to act
until they join you.”
“I’m not afraid!” snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. “It’s you
who should be scared!”
“But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent
believe…so tell me, while we wait for your friends…how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to
have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.”
Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and
took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter’s heart.
Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, “I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet
that no one’s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.”
“Aaaah.” Dumbledore’s sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment. “That was
clever…there is a pair, I take it?”
“The other’s in Borgin and Burkes,” said Malfoy, “and they make a kind of passage between
them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but
sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the
shop, as if the Cabinet was traveling between them, but he couldn’t make anyone hear him…in the
end he managed to Apparate out, even though he’d never passed his test. He nearly died doing it.
Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realized what it meant —
even Borgin didn’t know — I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts through
the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.”
“Very good,” murmured Dumbledore. “So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and
Burkes into the school to help you…a clever plan, a very clever plan…and, as you say, right under
my nose…”
“Yeah,” said Malfoy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledore’s
praise. “Yeah, it was!”
“But there were times,” Dumbledore went on, “weren’t there, when you were not sure you
would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such
as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands…poisoning mead there
was only the slightest chance I might drink…”
“Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind that stuff, did you?” sneered Malfoy, as
Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry
struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him.
“As a matter of fact, I did,” said Dumbledore. “I was sure it was you.”
“Why didn’t you stop me, then?” Malfoy demanded.
“I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders —”
“He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my mother —”
“Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but —”
“He’s a double-agent, you stupid old man, he isn’t working for you, you just think he is!”
“We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape —”
“Well, you’re losing your grip, then!” sneered Malfoy. “He’s been offering me plenty of help —
wanting all the glory for himself — wanting a bit of the action — ‘What are you doing? Did you do
the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything —’ But I haven’t told him what I’ve
been doing in the Room of Requirement, he’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll all be over and
he won’t be the Dark Lord’s favorite any more, he’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!”
“Very gratifying,” said Dumbledore mildly. “We all like appreciation for our own hard work, of
course…but you must have had an accomplice, all the same…someone in Hogsmeade, someone
who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah”
Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep. “…of
course…Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?”
“Got there at last, have you?” Malfoy taunted.
There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his
shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on, “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in
her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room
unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead…well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you
before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present…yes, very
neat…very neat…poor Mr. Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta’s…tell
me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of
communication in and out of the school monitored.”
“Enchanted coins,” said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand
hand was shaking badly. “I had one and she had the other and I could send her messages-”
“Isn’t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore’s
Army used last year?” asked Dumbledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him
slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it.
“Yeah, I got the idea from them,” said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. “I got the idea of poisoning
the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not
recognising potions…”
“Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,” said Dumbledore.
Malfoy gave a harsh laugh.
“You care about me saying ‘Mudblood’ when I’m about to kill you?”
“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to
remain upright. “But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now.
We are quite alone. I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you
have not acted…”
Malfoy’s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter.
“Now, about tonight,” Dumbledore went on, “I am a little puzzled about how it
happened…you knew that I had left the school? But of course,” he answered his own question,
“Rosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I’m sure…”
“That’s right,” said Malfoy. “But she said you were just going for a drink, you’d be back…”
“Well, I certainly did have a drink…and I came back…after a fashion,” mumbled Dumbledore.
“So you decided to spring a trap for me?”
“We decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here, to see who’d
been killed,” said Malfoy. “And it worked!”
“Well…yes and no…” said Dumbledore. “But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been
murdered?”
“Someone’s dead,” said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. “One of
your people…I don’t know who, it was dark…I stepped over the body…I was supposed to be
waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way…”
“Yes, they do that,” said Dumbledore.
There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were
fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy and Harry stood, and
Harry’s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest…someone was dead…Malfoy had stepped
over the body…but who was it?
“There is little time, one way or another,” said Dumbledore. “So let us discuss your options,
Draco.”
“My options!” said Malfoy loudly. “I’m standing here with a wand — I’m about to kill you—”
“My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would
have done it when you first dsarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about
ways and means.”
“I haven’t got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was suddenly as white as Dumbledore. “I’ve got
to do it! He’ll kill me! He’ll kill my whole family!”
“I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said Dumbledore. “Why else do you think I have
not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord
Voldemort realized that I suspected you.”
Malfoy winced at the sound of the name.
“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case
he used Legilimency against you,” continued Dumbledore. “But now at last we can speak plainly to
each other…no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your
unintentional victims survived…I can help you, Draco.”
“No, you can’t,” said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. “Nobody can. He told
me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.”
“Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can
possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide
her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban…when the time comes we can protect
him too…come over to the right side, Draco…you are not a killer…”
Malfoy stared at Dumbledore.
“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly. “They thought I’d die in the attempt, but I’m
here…and you’re in my power…I’m the one with the wand…you’re at my mercy…”
“No, Draco,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.”
Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Harry thought he
saw it drop by a fraction —
But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out
of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ramparts. Still paralysed,
his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters
had won the fight below.
A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.
“Dumbledore cornered!” he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though
she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. “Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone!
Well done, Draco, well done!”
“Good evening, Amycus,” said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party.
“And you’ve brought Alecto too…charming…”
The woman gave an angry little titter.
“Think your little jokes’ll help you on your death bed, then?” she jeered.
“Jokes? No, no, these are manners,” replied Dumbledore.
“Do it,” said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and
whiskers, whose black Death Eater’s robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that
Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat
and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails.
“Is that you, Fenrir?” asked Dumbledore.
“That’s right,” rasped the other. “Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?”
“No, I cannot say that I am…”
Fenrir Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his
lips slowly, obscenely.
“But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.”
“Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most
unusual…you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?”
“That’s right,” said Greyback. “Shocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?”
“Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,” said Dumbledore. “And, yes, I am a little
shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live…”
“I didn’t,” breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Greyback; he did not seem to want to even
glance at him. “I didn’t know he was going to come —”
“I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,” rasped Greyback. “Not when there
are throats to be ripped out…delicious, delicious…”
And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore.
“I could do you for afters, Dumbledore…”
“No,” said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. “We’ve got
orders. Draco’s got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.”
Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore’s
face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.
“He’s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!” said the lopsided man, to the
accompaniment of his sister’s wheezing giggles. “Look at him — what’s happened to you, then,
Dumby?”
“Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,” said Dumbledore. “Old age, in short…one
day, perhaps, it will happen to you…if you are lucky…”
“What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?” yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent.
“Always the same, weren’t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don’t even know
why the Dark Lord’s bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!”
But at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted,
“They’ve blocked the stairs - Reducto! REDUCTO!”
Harry’s heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through
the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them —
“Now, Draco, quickly!” said the brutal-faced man angrily.
But Malfoy’s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.
“I’ll do it,” snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his
teeth bared.
“I said no!” shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted
out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry’s heart was hammering so
hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore’s
spell — if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak —
“Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us —” screeched the woman, but at that precise moment
the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his
hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four
Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.
“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike
upon Dumbledore, “the boy doesn’t seem able —”
But somebody else had spoken Snape’s name, quite softly.
“Severus…”
The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time,
Dumbledore was pleading.
Snape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three
Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.
Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the
harsh lines of his face.
“Severus…please…”
Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.
“Avada Kedavra!”
A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest.
Harry’s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as
Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the
shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of
sight.
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE
Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened… It could not have
happened…
“Out of here, quickly,” said Snape.
He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest;
Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they
vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him
paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside
as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.
“Petrificus Totalus!”
The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground,
rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and
running down the darkened staircase.
Terror tore at Harry’s heart…He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch
Snape…Somehow the two things were linked…He could reverse what had happened if he had them
both together…Dumbledore could not have died…
He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised.
The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was
raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the
hated voice shout, “It’s over, time to go!” and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end
of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As
Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it
was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell
backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and
mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat —
“Petrificus Totalus!”
Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and
onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the
fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two
bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry
now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy
Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was
giggling, enjoying the sport: “Crucio - Crucio - you can’t dance forever, pretty -”
“Impedimenta!” yelled Harry.
His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and
slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor
McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry
saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so
that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window —
“Harry, where did you come from?” Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put
his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering
them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape —
“Take that!” shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto,
sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He
launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across
someone’s legs. Looking around, he saw Neville’s pale, round face flat against the floor.
“Neville, are you -?”
“M’all right,” muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, “Harry…Snape ‘n’
Malfoy…ran past…”
“I know, I’m on it!” said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater
who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He
wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up
from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him,
the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did
not yet know…
He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head
start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had
the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear
nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty
corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters
was heading toward the front doors — perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked —
He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor
that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed
jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran
screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts
and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken…
He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and
Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step
halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a
corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.
“Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark —” began Ernie
Macmillan.
“Out of the way!” yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and
down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were
smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one
or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by
a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.
Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three
figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate — by the
looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy…
The cold night air ripped at Harry’s lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the
distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to
run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse —
Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from
his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred
his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head
said: not Hagrid…not Hagrid too…
Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the
ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that
the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him…
“Impedimenta!” he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and
miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to
his feet and sprinted on after Snape.
And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon
revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the
gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his
giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they
would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate —
Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape’s back, and yelled, “Stupefy!”
He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape’s head; Snape shouted, “Run, Draco!”and
turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands
simultaneously.
“Cruc —”
But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it;
Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled,
“Incendio!” Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them:
Hagrid’s house was on fire.
“Fang’s in there, yer evil —!” Hagrid bellowed.
“Cruc —” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the
dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.
“No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!” he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid’s
yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. “You haven’t got the nerve or the ability —”
“Incarc —”Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.
“Fight back!” Harry screamed at him. “Fight back, you cowardly —”
“Coward, did you call me, Potter?” shouted Snape. “Your father would never attack me unless it
was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?”
“Stupe —”
“Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind
closed, Potter!” sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. “Now come!” he shouted at the huge
Death Eater behind Harry. “It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up —”
“Impedi —”
But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass.
Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death
or madness —
“No!” roared Snape’s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled
on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, “Have
you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord — we are to leave him! Go! Go!”
And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous
Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that
instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly
toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself —
“Sectum —!”
Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now
and he could see Snape’s face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames
showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi —
“No, Potter!” screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward,
hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid
yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and
defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape’s pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was
suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.
“You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them — I, the Half-
Blood Prince! And you’d turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don’t think
so…no!”
Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and
out of sight.
“Kill me then,” panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. “Kill me like
you killed him, you coward —”
“DON’T —” screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was
in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them —”CALL ME
COWARD!”
And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and
was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment
all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and
something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as
the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still
swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the
enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech —
Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but
even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure
enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates.
Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries.
“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. “HAGRID?”
He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames
carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in
every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.
“Yeh all righ’, Harry? Yeh all righ’? Speak ter me, Harry…”
Hagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell
burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang’s reassuringly warm and alive body
quivering beside him.
“I’m all right,” panted Harry. “Are you?”
“‘Course I am…take more’n that ter finish me.”
Hagrid put his hands under Harry’s arms and raised him up with such force that Harry’s feet
momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling
down Hagrid’s cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.
“We should put out your house,” said Harry, “the charm’s ‘Aguamenti’…”
“Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery
umbrella and said, “Aguamenti!”
A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and
murmured “Aguamenti” too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last
flame was extinguished.
“S’not too bad,” said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck.
“Nothin Dumbledore won’ be able to put righ’…”
Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness,
horror rose inside him.
“Hagrid…”
“I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ‘em coming,” said Hagrid sadly, still
staring at his wrecked cabin. “They’ll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things…”
“Hagrid…”
“But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death Eaters runnin down from the castle, but
what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ‘em? Where’s he gone — was he chasin’ them?”
“He…” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. “Hagrid, he killed…”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed? What’re yeh on abou’
Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed…Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank,
uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him…”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be stupid, Harry. Wha’s
made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that
Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the
aftereffects of a jinx…
“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,”
Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the
school. Come on, Harry…”
Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would
find out soon enough, too soon…As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that
many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved
from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over
Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed…
The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn.
Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around
nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry’s eyes, however, were
fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black,
huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort.
Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought Dumbledore’s body must lie, however, he
saw people beginning to move toward it.
“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang
keeping as close as he could to their ankles. “Wha’s that lyin’ on the grass?” Hagrid added sharply,
heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. “See
it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark…Blimey…yeh don’ think someone
got thrown —?”
Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside
him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour
had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them.
What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest…
He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the
dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.
Harry heard Hagrid’s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward
until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known
there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon
him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no
preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would
ever, meet.
Dumbledore’s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have
been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and
wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old
face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would
Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help …
The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that
he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.
The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore’s
pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could
not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that
there was something wrong …
He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered
seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was
supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded
parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.
Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment
of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:
To the Dark Lord
I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered
your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more.
R.A.B.
Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a
Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry
crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to
howl.
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
THE PHOENIX LAMENT
“C ‘mere, Harry…”
“No.”
“Yeh can’ stay here, Harry…Come on, now…”
“No.”
He did not want to leave Dumbledores side, he did not want to move anywhere. Hagrid’s hand
on his shoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, “Harry, come on.”
A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its
pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he
realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the
castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry
and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry’s
vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the
floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.
“We’re going to the hospital wing,” said Ginny.
“I’m not hurt,” said Harry.!
“It’s McGonagalls orders,” said Ginny. “Everyone’s up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and
everyone —”
Fear stirred in Harry’s chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.
“Ginny, who else is dead?”
“Don’t worry, none of us.”
“But the Dark Mark — Malfoy said he stepped over a body —”
“He stepped over Bill, but its all right, he’s alive.”
There was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew boded ill.
“Are you sure?”
“Of course I’m sure…he’s a — a bit of a mess, that’s all. Greyback attacked him. Madam
Pomfrey says he won’t — won’t look the same anymore…”
Ginny’s voice trembled a little.
“We don’t really know what the aftereffects will be — I mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but
not transformed at the time.”
“But the others…There were other bodies on the ground…”
“Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says they’ll be all right. And
a Death Eater’s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere —
Harry, if we hadn’t had your Felix potion, I think we’d all have been killed, but everything seemed
to just miss us —”
They had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors, Harry saw Neville lying,
apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered
around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked
up. Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.
“Are you all right, Harry?”
“I’m fine…How’s Bill?”
Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione’s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying
on Bill’s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing
at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. Harry remembered how Snape had
mended Malfoy’s Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.
“Can’t you fix them with a charm or something?” he asked the matron.
“No charm will work on these,” said Madam Pomfrey. “I’ve tried everything I know, but there is
no cure for werewolf bites.”
“But he wasn’t bitten at the full moon,” said Ron, who was gazing down into his brother’s face
as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring. “Greyback hadn’t transformed, so
surely Bill won’t be a — a real —?”
He looked uncertainly at Lupin.
“No, I don’t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,” said Lupin, “but that does not mean that
there won’t be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully,
and — and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on.”
“Dumbledore might know something that’d work, though,” Ron said. “Where is he? Bill fought
those maniacs on Dumbledore’s orders, Dumbledore owes him, he can’t leave him in this state -”
“Ron — Dumbledores dead,” said Ginny.
“No!” Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the latter might contradict
her, but when Harry did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill’s bed, his hands over his face.
Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something
private, indecent. He turned away and caught Ron’s eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that
confirmed what Ginny had said.
“How did he die?” whispered Tonks. “How did it happen?”
“Snape killed him,” said Harry. “I was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower
because that’s where the Mark was…Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was
a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldn’t do anything, I
was under the Invisibility Cloak — and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him —”
Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned. Luna’s mouth trembled.
“— more Death Eaters arrived — and then Snape — and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.”
Harry couldn’t go on.
Madam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny, who whispered,
“Shh! Listen!”
Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in
the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of
terrible beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside
him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and
through the castle windows.
How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a
little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door
opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the
recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.
“Molly and Arthur are on their way,” she said, and the spell of the music was broken: Everyone
roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their
own eyes shake their heads. “Harry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with Professor
Dumbledore when he — when it happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some —”
“Snape killed Dumbledore,” said Harry.
She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have
pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under
McGonagall.
“Snape,” repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. “We all wondered…but he
trusted…always…Snape…I can’t believe it…”
“Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,” said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh.
“We always knew that.”
“But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!” whispered Tonks. “I always thought Dumbledore
must know something about Snape that we didn’t…”
“He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape,” muttered Professor
McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. “I
mean…with Snapes history…of course people were bound to wonder…but Dumbledore told me
explicitly that Snape’s repentance was absolutely genuine — Wouldn’t hear a word against him!”
“I’d love to know what Snape told him to convince him,” said Tonks.
“I know,” said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. “Snape passed Voldemort the
information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he
hadn’t realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he’d done it, sorry that they were dead.”
They all stared at him.
“And Dumbledore believed that?” said Lupin incredulously. “Dumbledore believed Snape was
sorry James was dead? Snape hated James…”
“And he didn’t think my mother was worth a damn either,” said Harry, “because she was
Muggle-born…‘Mudblood,’ he called her…”
Nobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to
digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.
“This is all my fault,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her
wet handkerchief in her hands. “My fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him
to come and help us! If I hadn’t alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined
forces with the Death Eaters. I don’t think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don’t
think he knew they were coming.”
“It isn’t your fault, Minerva,” said Lupin firmly. “We all wanted more help, we were glad to
think Snape was on his way…”
“So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters’ side?” asked Harry, who
wanted every detail of Snape’s duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him,
to swear vengeance.
“I don’t know exactly how it happened,” said Professor McGonagall distractedly. “It’s all so
confusing…Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we
were to patrol the corridors just in case…Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us…and so we
patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody
could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don’t know
how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered…”
“I do,” said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the
magical pathway they formed. “So they got in through the Room of Requirement.”
Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.
“I messed up, Harry,” said Ron bleakly. “We did like you told us: We checked the Marauder’s
Map and we couldn’t see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so
me, Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on it…but Malfoy got past us.”
“He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch,” said Ginny. “He was
on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm —”
“His Hand of Glory,” said Ron. “Gives light only to the holder, remember?”
“Anyway,” Ginny went on, “he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the
Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went
pitch-black —”
“— Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said Ron bitterly. “Fred and George’s. I’m going to be
having a word with them about who they let buy their products.”
“We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,” said Ginny. “Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all
we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people
rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but
we didn’t dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we’d reached a
corridor that was light, they’d gone.”
“Luckily,” said Lupin hoarsely, “Ron, Ginny, and Neville ran into us almost immediately and
told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of
the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn’t expected more people to be on the watch; he
seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they
scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs -”
“To set off the Mark?” asked Harry.
“He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of
Requirement,” said Lupin. “But I don’t think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for
Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing
Curse that just missed me.”
“So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville,” said Harry,
turning to Hermione, “were you —?”
“Outside Snape’s office, yes,” whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, “with Luna.
We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened…We didn’t know what was going on
upstairs, Ron had taken the map — It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting
down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don’t think he really
registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape’s office and we heard
him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and
Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and — and —”
“What?” Harry urged her.
“I was so stupid, Harry!” said Hermione in a high-pitched whisper. “He said Professor Flitwick
had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he — while he went to help fight the
Death Eaters —” She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her
voice was muffled. “We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him
unconscious on the floor…and oh, it’s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we
didn’t realize, Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let Snape go!”
“It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly. “Hermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of
the way, he probably would have killed you and Luna.”
“So then he came upstairs,” said Harry, who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase
in his mind’s eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his
cloak as he ascended, “and he found the place where you were all fighting…”
“We were in trouble, we were losing,” said Tonks in a low voice. “Gibbon was down, but the
rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been
savaged by Greyback…It was all dark…curses flying everywhere…The Malfoy boy had vanished, he
must have slipped past, up the stairs…then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the
stair behind them with some kind of curse…Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air —”
“None of us could break through,” said Ron, “and that massive Death Eater was still firing off
jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us…”
“And then Snape was there,” said Tonks, “and then he wasn’t —”
“I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right afterward
and I ducked and lost track of things,” said Ginny.
“I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn’t there,” said Lupin. “I tried
to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville…”
“He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered McGonagall. “After all — he was the
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher…I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the
Death Eaters who’d escaped up to the tower…”
“He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not to stop them…and I’ll bet you had to
have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier — so what happened when he came back down?”
“Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also
broke the curse blocking the stairs,” said Lupin. “We all ran forward — those of us who were still
standing anyway — and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust — obviously, none of us
attacked them —”
“We just let them pass,” said Tonks in a hollow voice. “We thought they were being chased by
the Death Eaters — and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were
fighting again — I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I don’t know what —”
“He shouted, ‘It’s over,’” said Harry. “He’d done what he’d meant to do.”
They all fell silent. Fawkes’s lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. As the music
reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry’s mind…Had they
taken Dumbledore’s body from the foot of the tower yet? What would happen to it next? Where
would it rest? He clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of the
fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.
The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were
striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.
“Molly — Arthur —” said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. “I
am so sorry —”
“Bill,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bill’s
mangled face. “Oh, Bill!”
Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer
to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.
“You said Greyback attacked him?” Mr. Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly. “But
he hadn’t transformed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Bill?”
“We don’t yet know,” said Professor McGonagall, looking helplessly at Lupin.
“There will probably be some contamination, Arthur,”.said Lupin. “It is an odd case, possibly
unique…We don’t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens…”
Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at
Bill’s wounds.
“And Dumbledore…” said Mr. Weasley. “Minerva, is it true…Is he really…?”
As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her. Her
slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression
on her face.
“Dumbledore gone,” whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son;
she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated face.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks…It’s not r-really important…but he was a very
handsome little b-boy…always very handsome…and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What do you mean, ‘he was
going to be married?’”
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only that —”
“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” demanded Fleur. “You theenk, because of
these bites, he will not love me?”
“No, that’s not what I —”
“Because ‘e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long
mane of silver hair. “It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!”
“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I thought perhaps — given how— how he—”
“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per’aps, you hoped?” said Fleur, her nostrils
flaring. “What do I care how he looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these
scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!” she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley
aside and snatching the ointment from her.
Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bill’s wounds with a
most curious expression upon her face. Nobody said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like
everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.
“Our Great-Auntie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, “has a very beautiful tiara —
goblin-made — which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond
of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.”
“Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be lovely.”
And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both, women were crying and hugging each
other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron
looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.
“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still wants to marry him, even
though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!
“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. “Bill will not be a
full werewolf. The cases are completely —”
“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupin’s robes and shaking
them. “I’ve told you a million times…”
And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the reason she had come
running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback,
all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.
“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor,
“that I am too old for you, too poor…too dangerous…”
“I’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur’s
shoulder as she patted her on the back.
“I am not being ridiculous,” said Lupin steadily. “Tonks deserves somebody young and whole.”
“But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. “And after all, Remus, young and
whole men do not necessarily remain so.”
He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.
“This is…not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, avoiding everybody’s eyes as he looked
around distractedly. “Dumbledore is dead…”
“Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love
in the world,” said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid
walked in.
The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; he was
shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his hand.
“I’ve…I’ve done it, Professor,” he choked. “M-moved him. Professor Sprout’s got the kids back
in bed. Professor Flitwick’s lyin down, but he says he’ll be all righ’ in a jiffy, an’ Professor Slughorn
says the Ministry’s bin informed.”
“Thank you, Hagrid,” said Professor McGonagall, standing up at once and turning to look at
the group around Bill’s bed. “I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell
the Heads of Houses — Slughorn can represent Slytherin — that I want to see them in my office
forthwith. I would like you to join us too.”
As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry.
“Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If you’ll come with me….”
Harry stood up, murmured “See you in a bit” to Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and followed
Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound
was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not
heading for Professor McGonagall’s office, but for Dumbledore’s, and another few seconds before he
realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress…. Apparently she was now
headmistress…so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers.
In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not
know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that
Dumbledore’s body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he
and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on
their spindle legged tables, Gryffindor’s sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the
Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk, the Fawkes’s perch stood empty, he was still crying his
lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and
headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half-
moon spectacle perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.
After glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though
steeling herself, then rounded the’ desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined.
“Harry,” she said, “I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this
evening when you left the school.”
“I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said Harry. He had expected the question and had his answer
ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the
contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.
“Harry, it might be important,” said Professor McGonagall.
“It is,” said Harry, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell anyone.”
Professor McGonagall glared at him. “Potter” — Harry registered the renewed use of his
surname — “in the light of Professor Dumbledore’s death, I think you must see that the situation
has changed somewhat —”
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging. “Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop
following his orders if he died.”
“But —”
“There’s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here though. Madam Rosmerta’s
under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that’s how the necklace
and the poisoned mead —”
“Rosmerta?” said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but before she could go on, there was a
knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn traipsed into the
room, followed by Hagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his huge frame trembling with grief.
“Snape!” ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating. “Snape! I taught
him! I thought I knew him!”
But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A
sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas.
“Minerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just Disapparated from the Ministry.”
“Thank you, Everard,” said Professor McGonagall, and she turned quickly to her teachers.
“I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here,” she said quickly.
“Personally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year. The death of the
headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts’s history. It is
horrible.”
“I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open,” said Professor Sprout.
“I feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that pupil.”
“But will we have a single pupil after this?” said Slughorn, now dabbing his sweating brow with a
silken handkerchief. “Parents will want to keep their children at home and I can’t say I blame them.
Personally, I don’t think we’re in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can’t
expect mothers to think like that. They’ll want to keep their families together, it’s only natural.”
“I agree,” said Professor McGonagall. “And in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore
never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened
he considered the closure of the school — and I must say that Professor Dumbledore’s murder is
more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin’s monster living undetected in the bowels of the
castle…”
“We must consult the governors,” said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a
large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape’s office. “We
must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily.”
“Hagrid, you haven’t said anything,” said Professor McGonagall. “What are your views, ought
Hogwarts to remain open?”
Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this
conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I dunno, Professor…that’s fer the Heads of
House an the headmistress ter decide…”
“Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,” said Professor McGonagall kindly, “and so
do I.”
“Well, I’m stayin,” said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling
down into his tangled beard. “It’s me home, it’s bin me home since I was thirteen. An’ if there’s kids
who wan’ me ter teach ‘em, I’ll do it. But…I dunno…Hogwarts without Dumbledore…” He
gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.
“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to
see whether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to
do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision.
“Now, as to getting students home…there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later.
We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well…” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. “I — I
know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No other headmaster or
headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,” growled Hagrid.
“Hogwarts should be Dumbledore’s final resting place,” said Professor Flitwick.
“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout.
“And in that case,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t send the students home until the funeral’s over.
They’ll want to say —”
The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him.
“Good-bye.”
“Well said,” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “Well said indeed! Our students should pay tribute, it
is fitting. We can arrange transport home afterward.”
“Seconded,” barked Professor Sprout.
“I suppose…yes…” said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice, while Hagrid let out a strangled sob
of assent.
“He’s coming,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly, gazing down into the grounds. “The
Minister…and by the looks of it. he’s brought a delegation…”
“Can I leave, Professor?” said Harry at once.
He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus Scrimgeour tonight.
“You may,” said Professor McGonagall. “And quickly.”
She strode toward the door and held it open for him. He sped down the spiral staircase and off
along the deserted corridor; he had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but
it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or
Peeves. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor
common room.
“Is it true?” whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. “It is really true? Dumbledore —
dead?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.
As Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed. The room fell silent as
he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This
meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without
making eye contact at all, Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys’
dormitories.
As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down
on his own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.
“They’re talking about closing the school,” said Harry.
“Lupin said they would,” said Ron.
There was a pause.
“So?” said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in.
“Did you find one? Did you get it? A — a Horcrux?”
Harry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old
nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?
“You didn’t get it?” said Ron, looking crestfallen. “It wasn’t there?”
“No,” said Harry. “Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place.”
“Already taken —?”
Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The
full story could wait…It did not matter tonight…nothing mattered except the end, the end of their
pointless adventure, the end of Dumbledore’s life…
“R.A.B.,” whispered Ron, “but who was that?”
“Dunno,” said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt
no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there,
he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing. And he knew,
without knowing how he knew it, that ilie phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as
Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world…had left Harry.
CHAPTER THIRTY
THE WHITE TOMB
All lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students were hurried away from
Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days — the Patil twins were gone before breakfast
on the morning following Dumbledore’s death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by
his haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany
his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she
agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in
Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village,
preparing to pay their last respects to Dumbledore.
Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a
powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring
out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest. Harry
watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended
the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid’s arms. Meanwhile a delegation of
Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the
castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that, sooner or later, he
would be asked again to account for Dumbledore’s last excursion from Hogwarts.
Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together. The beautiful
weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have been if Dumbledore had not
died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, Ginny’s examinations finished,
the pressure of homework lifted…and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he
must say, doing what he knew it was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of
comfort.
They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been discharged, but Bill remained under
Madam Pomfrey’s care. His scars were as bad as ever; in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to
Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs, but in personality he seemed just the
same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare
steaks.
“…so eet ees lucky ‘e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because
ze British overcook their meat, I ‘ave always said this.”
“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,” sighed Ginny
later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor
common room, looking out over the twilit grounds,
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows,
and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice.
“No,” she said reprovingly, folding up ihe newspaper. “They’re still looking for Snape, but no
sign…”
“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry every lime this subject cropped up. “They
won’t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this
time…”
“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t been sleeping that well since…well…I could
do with some sleep.”
She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other two and departed for the
girls’ dormitories. The moment the door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forwards towards
Harry with a most Hermione-ish look on her face.
“Harry, I found something out this morning, in the library…”
“R.A.B.?” said Harry, silling up straight.
He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the
bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux
had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path
stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, and which he
now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there
somewhere and each would need to be found and elim-inated before there was even a possibility that
Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he
could bring them within reach: the locket.., the cup…the snake…something of Gryffindor’s or
Ravenclaw’s…the locket…the cup…the snake…something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s…
This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry’s mind as he fell asleep at night, and his dreams
were thick with cups, lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though
Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to
climb…
He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledore’s death, and
although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about
whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was
strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.
“No,” she said sadly, “I’ve been trying, Harry, but I haven’t found anything…there are a couple
of reasonably well-known wizards with those initials - Rosalind Antigone Bungs…Rupert
‘Axebanger’ Brookstanton…but they don’t seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who
stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can’t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger
ever had anything to do with him…no, actually, it’s about…well, Snape.”
She looked nervous even saying the name again.
“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.
“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince business,” she said tentatively.
“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How do you think I feel about that now?”
“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around to check that they
were not being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You
see…she was Snape’s mother!”
“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored him.
“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about
Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that
she’d given birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well…yes,” said Hermione. “So…I was sort of right. Snape must have been proud of being
‘half a Prince’, you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle from what it said in the Prophet”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could get in with Lucius
Malfoy and the rest of them…he’s just like Voldemort. Pure-blood mother, Muggle
father…ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself
an impressive new name — Lord Voldemort — the Half-Blood Prince - how could Dumbledore
have missed —?”
He broke off, looking out of the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon
Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape…but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him,
he, Harry, had been taken in just the same…in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled
spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much…
Helped him…it was an almost unendurable thought, now…
“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,” said Ron. “He must’ve known
where you were getting it all from.”
“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used Sectumsempra. He didn’t really need
Legilimency…he might even have known before then, with Slughom talking about how brilliant I
was at Potions…shouldn’t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?”
“But why didn’t he turn you in?”
“I don’t ihink he wanted to associate himself with that book,” said Hermione. “I don’t think
Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he’d known. And even if Snape pretended it hadn’t
been his, Slughorn would have recognised his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snape’s
old classroom, and I’ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘Prince’.”
“I should’ve shown the book to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “All that time he was showing me
how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and I had proof Snape was, too —”
“‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said Hermione quietly.
“You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!”
“I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re pulling too much blame on yourself. I thought the Prince
seemed to have a nasty sense of humour, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer…”
“None of us could’ve guessed Snape would…you know,” said Ron.
Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they,
like him, were thinking about the following morning, when Dumbledore’s body would be laid to
rest. Harry had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had
died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how
he would feel. He wondered whether Dumbledore’s death would be more real to him once the
funeral was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm
him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about
anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really
gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of loophole,
some way that Dumbledore would come back…he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake
Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it
had cost and what remained still to do.
Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the
funeral. Downstairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Everybody was wearing their
dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in
the middle of the staff table empty. Hagrid’s chair was deserted too: Harry thought that perhaps he
had not been able to face breakfast; but Snape’s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus
Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable
feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeour’s entourage Harry spotted the red
hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart
from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.
Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering together. Hulking boys though
they were, they looked oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing
them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he
had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy’s voice on that Tower top, nor the fact that he had lowered his
wand before the other Death Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed
Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest
drop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was
Voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents?
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had
risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.
“It is nearly time,” she said. “Please follow your Heads of House out into the grounds.
Gryffindors, after me.”
They filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head
of the Slytherin column, wearing magnificent long emerald-green robes embroidered with silver. He
had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single
patch on her hat, and when they reached the Entrance Hall, they found Madam Pince standing
beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reek-
ing of mothbails.
They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front
doors, towards the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor
McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran
down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the
most beautiful summer’s day.
An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and
smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including
members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mad-Eye Moody, Tonks, her hair
miraculously returned to vividest pink, Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands,
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing
jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two-and-a-half chairs
on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbour, the
hairy bass player from the wizardmg group the Weird Sisters, Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus,
Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by
sight, such as the barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts
Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when
they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air.
Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People
were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by
far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville
being helped into a seat by Luna. They alone of all the D.A. had responded to Hermione’s summons
the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who had missed the
D.A. most…probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would
be another meeting.
Cornelius Fudge walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his
green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a
notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge,
an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-
colored curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water’s
edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away.
The staff were seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front
row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people
were really sorry that Dumbledore was dead. But then he heard music, strange, otherworldly music,
and he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the only
one: many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.
“In there,” whispered Ginny in Harry’s ear.
And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him
horribly of the Inferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand,
their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on
Harry’s neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As
he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for
Dumbledore’s passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked round.
Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face
gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what
Harry knew to be Dumbledore’s body. A sharp pain rose in Harry’s throat at this sight: for a
moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledore’s body was so close seemed to take
all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both
Ginny and Hermione’s laps.
They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the
body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud
trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores
Umbridge…but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly
gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid’s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where
he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realized what was
guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the
giant Grawp, his great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next
to his half-brother and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the
ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he
turned to face the front again.
A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of
Dumbledore’s body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over
the hundreds of beads. “Nobility of spirit”…“intellectual contribution”…“greatness of heart”…it
did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He
suddenly remembered Dumbledore’s idea of a few words: “nitwit”, “oddment”, “blubber” and
“tweak”, and again, had to suppress a grin…what was the matter with him?
There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface
to listen, too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water’s edge two years ago, very close to
where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where
Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should
have said…
And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and
undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone…he clutched the cold locket in his
hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away
from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black
droned on…there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too.
They did not move into the open but Harry saw them standing quite still, half-hidden in shadow,
watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remembered his first nightmarish
trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and
how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long
thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only
then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated…
And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him
had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore,
all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between
him and Voldemort; he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one:
that the shelter of a parent’s arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his
nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his
imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever
been before.
The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for
somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody
moved.
Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledore’s body and
the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled
into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a
phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white
marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore’s body and the table on which he had rested.
There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell
far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs’ tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear
back into the cool trees. Likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost
from view.
Harry looked at Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ron’s face was screwed up as though the sunlight
was blinding him. Hermione’s face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met
Harry’s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after
winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each
other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say “Be
careful”, or “Don’t do it”, but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less
of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had
died.
“Ginny, listen…” he said very quietly, as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and
people began to get to their feet. “I can’t be involved with you anymore. We’ve got to stop seeing
each other. We can’t be together.”
She said, with an oddly twisted smile, “It’s for some stupid, noble reason, isn’t it?”
“It’s been like…like something out of someone else’s life, these last few weeks with you,” said
Harry. “But I can’t…we can’t…I’ve got things to do alone now.”
She did not cry, she simply looked at him,
“Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He’s already used you as bait once, and that was
just because you’re my best friend’s sister. Think how much danger you’ll be in if we keep this up.
He’ll know, he’ll find out. He’ll try and get to me through you.”
“What if I don’t care?” said Ginny fiercely.
“I care,” said Harry. “How do you think I’d feel if this was your funeral…and it was my fault…”
She looked away from him, over the lake.
“I never really gave up on you,” she said. “Not really. I always hoped…Hermione told me to get
on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to
be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more
notice if I was a bit more — myself.”
“Smart girl, that Hermione,” said Harry, trying to smile. “I just wish I’d asked you sooner. We
could ‘ve had ages…months…years maybe…”
“But you’ve been too busy saving the wizarding world,” said Ginny, half-laughing. “Well…I
can’t say I’m surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn’t be happy unless
you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that’s why I like you so much.”
Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he
remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while
she sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable
gesture, Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledore’s tomb and walked away
around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still: just as setting out as soon as
possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it…
“Harry!”
He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank, leaning on his
walking stick.
“I’ve been hoping to have a word…do you mind if I walk a little way with you?”
“No,” said Harry indifferently, and set off again.
“Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,” said Scrimgeour quietly, “I cannot tell you how appalled I
was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but
no one knows better than I —”
“What do you want?” asked Harry flatly.
Scrimgeour looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful
understanding.
“You are, of course, devastated,” he said. “I know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I
think you may have been his favorite ever pupil. The bond between the two of you —”
“What do you want?” Harry repeated, coming to a halt.
Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now.
“The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.”
“Whose word?” said Harry.
“Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the Tower after Dumbledore died. There were
also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Harry.”
“Glad to hear it,” said Harry. “Well, where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my
business. He didn’t want people to know.”
“Such loyalty is admirable, of course,” said Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his
irritation with difficulty, “but Dumbledore is gone, Harry. He’s gone”
“He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,” said Harry, smiling in
spite of himself.
“My dear boy…even Dumbledore cannot return from the —”
“I am not saying he can. You wouldn’t understand. But I’ve got nothing to tell you.”
Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy, “The
Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a
couple of my Aurors at your service —”
Harry laughed.
“Voldemort wants to kill me himself and Aurors won’t stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no
thanks.”
“So,” said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, “the request I made of you at Christmas —”
“What request? Oh yeah…the one where I tell the world what a great job you’re doing in
exchange for — ”
“— for raising everyone’s morale!” snapped Scrimgeour.
Harry considered him for a moment.
“Released Stan Shunpike yet?”
Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of Uncle Vernon.
“I see you are —”
“Dumbledore’s man through and through,” said Harry. “That’s right.”
Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another
word. Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous
glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and Hermione were
hurrying towards Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction; Harry turned and
walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree
under which they had sat in happier times.
“What did Scrimgeour want?” Hermione whispered.
“Same as he wanted at Christmas,” shrugged Harry. “Wanted me to give him inside information
on Dumbledore and be the Ministry’s new poster boy.”
Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to Hermione, “Look, let
me go back and hit Percy!”
“No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm.
“It’ll make me feel better!”
Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded as she looked up at the
castle.
“I can’t bear the idea that we might never come back.” she said softly. “How can Hogwarts
close?”
“Maybe it won’t,” said Ron. “We’re not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we?
Everywhere’s the same now. I’d even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend
the place. What d’you reckon, Harry?”
“I’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said Harry.
Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, “I knew you were going to say that. But then what
will you do?”
“I’m going back to the Dursleys’ once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to,” said Harry.
“But it’ll be a short visit, and then I’ll be gone for good.”
“But where will you go if you don’t come back to school?”
“I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry muttered. He had had the idea in his
head ever since the night of Dumbledore’s death. “For me, it started there, all of it. I’ve just got a
feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.”
“And then what?” said Ron.
“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven’t I?” said Harry, his eyes upon
Dumbledore’s white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. “That’s what he
wanted me to do, that’s why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right — and I’m sure he
was — there are still four of them out there. I’ve got to find them and destroy them and then I’ve
got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort’s soul, the bit that’s still in his body, and I’m the one
who’s going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape along the way,” he added, “so much the better
tor me, so mucn the worse for him.”
There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the
monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still
echoing across the water.
“We’ll be there, Harry,” said Ron.
“What?”
“At your aunt and uncle’s house,” said Ron. “And then we’ll go with you, wherever you’re
going.”
“No —” said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant them to understand that
he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone.
“You said to us once before,” said Hermione quietly, “that there was time to turn back if we
wanted to. We’ve had time, haven’t we?”
“We’re with you whatever happens,” said Ron. “But, mate, you’re going to have to come round
my mum and dad’s house before we do anything else, even Godric’s Hollow.”
“Why?”
“Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?”
Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist
seemed incredible and yet wonderful.
“Yeah, we shouldn’t miss that,” he said finally.
His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of
the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with
Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the
thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.

HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
1. The Escape
Harry slunk warily along the footpath, his head slightly bowed, eye’s darting up and down the
street, glancing every now and then left and right. His right hand hovered over the pocket in his
worn out faded jeans where his wand lay hidden, but within easy grasp. His fist was unconsciously
clenching and unclenching. Most people would have found the misty cool night air soothing,
pleasant, but Harry was on edge.
As he rounded the corner of Privet Drive, he stopped. His head turned to survey the street before
him. There was nothing out of the ordinary, but he knew someone was there, somewhere, lurking in
the darkest corners, or hidden by magic. He could feel their presence as sure as he knew he was
standing there himself. He waited for someone to show. He never knew who it would be, but he
could predict their appearance down to the last second. He stood for a moment, almost
overwhelmed by his impatience. It had been the same every night ever since he had been at his
Aunt and Uncles. And tonight, as before, a figure gradually emerged from the nothingness.
Harry was able to make out the features as it made it's way towards him. It was Kingsley
Shacklebolt. After scanning the area as soon as he had seen Harry, Kingsley had removed his
invisibility cloak and given Harry a quick nod in greeting. When they were within a few feet of each
other, Harry spoke.
‘What’s happening? Who’s here with you?’ His voice was calm, but his look was determined.
‘Goldstein is at the other end of the street’ Kingsley said in his deep voice ‘But he’ll be replaced by
Tonks at midnight. I’m on until dawn.’ Even as he spoke, he never stopped surveying the area.
‘Nothing to report?’
This is how the quick exchanges between Harry and his guard had gone every night.
‘No, nothing.’ Harry’s eye’s barely met Kingsley’s as he looked down at his shuffling feet. ‘So …
when am I getting out of here?’
‘Nothing yet I’m afraid.’ Kingsley was used to Harry’s impatience, he had stood guard five out of the
eight nights since Harry had returned to Privet Drive. ‘Give it a bit of time,’ he said ‘things are not
as … easy … as they were. It’s going to take a fair bit of organizing. As it is Podmore has to leave
early …’ he brushed his hand over his bald head ‘so I’m going to be hear alone for about half an
hour.’
Harry looked up suddenly, and then looked back at the ground just as quickly, his eyes seeming to
be searching for something. This was it! He thought. This was what he’d been waiting for. It was
only a short amount of time, he would have to cut it close, but he knew he could do it. With one
guard gone, he could slip through.
‘Is there any other news?’ Harry always dreaded asking this, but he had to know. If he was going to
go through with his plan, he had to learn everything he could about what The Order knew. There
was silence as Harry waited, eyes still lingering on the ground. He was sure if Kingsley caught his
eye, he would see the guilt Harry tried so hard to conceal. Kingsley cleared his throat.
‘Some of the usual stuff.’ he said, though he seemed hesitant. ‘A few more missing people … they
found Fudge’s body late last night.’
Harry looked away in disgust. Fudge hadn’t been his favourite person in the world. When Harry had
returned from the graveyard, clutching Cedric Diggory’s dead body during the Triwizard Tournament
over two years ago, Fudge had refused to believe that Voldemort had taken form again. And in the
year following, he had gone to great lengths to discredit Harry in every way possible, squashing
most of Dumbledore’s efforts to get people to believe in Harry and to prepare for Lord Voldemort’s
return. But for all Fudge’s faults, he did not deserve the hand that fate had dealt him.
Harry took a deep breath and turned back to Kingsley. Somehow this news had given him the push
he needed. He now held such resolve that he was right in his plans, that he could look Shacklebolt
directly in the eyes.
- 2 -
‘What are Voldemort and his Death Eaters up to? They must have a plan! You must know something
from following the trail of blood they leave behind.’ Harry said this with such loathing that Kingsley
barely grimaced at the mention of the name Voldemort, but pulled back slightly from Harry,
seemingly more uncomfortable with his tone.
‘We don’t know … exactly.’ Kingsley said evasively. This was the final straw for Harry, he could tell
Kingsley was reluctant to say too much, and finally the pressure of the past eight days, sitting
uselessly in his room at the Dursleys waiting for news, biding his time unable to rest as he waited
for his chance, suddenly burst to the surface.
‘If you think’ he said gravely ‘that Dumbledore didn’t know I was ready for this,’ his eyes blazed
threateningly ‘then you’ve already lost to Voldemort!’ his body was rigid with frustration.
Kingsley seemed exceedingly uncomfortable, but Harry didn’t care. If he was going to get out of
Privet Drive tonight and take on the task Dumbledore had left him to do, then he needed
information, and he needed it now. Harry had no intention of going after Voldemort yet. He had to
find and destroy all of the Horcruxes, the artefacts that contained the pieces of Voldemort’s
shattered soul, before he could do that. No, he needed information so he could avoid detection. If
he was going to do this, he was going to have to do it alone, and the last thing he needed was for
Voldemort to find out what he was up to. With the exception of Ron and Hermione, no one would
know where he was, not the Order, not Mr. and Mrs. Weasley … not even Ginny.
‘Look,’ Kingsley said, he was fidgeting with the invisibility cloak hanging fluidly in his left hand. ‘I
don’t know what good it will do you to know too much right now anyway. You-you can’t leave until
you turn seventeen in a few weeks, it’s safer that way. You will be better protected here than
anywhere else until then, now that Dumble…’ he trailed off with an awkward hand gesture. ‘Well …
you know what I mean.’ He gave Harry a steady look, ‘It’s what he would have wanted.’
Harry let out a heavy sigh and his body slackened slightly. He knew he could not tell Kingsley why
Dumbledore would have understood, he could not tell him about the Horcruxes, about Dumbledore’s
dying wish, so he resigned himself to returning to No 4, where he would sit and wait, now his
chance had come. Harry turned to leave, hunched over, defeated, and had only gone a few paces
when Kingsley called after him.
‘See you same time tomorrow night, then.’
Harry turned slowly and looked at Kingsley ‘Yeah,’ he said quietly ‘I’ll be here.’ A sinking feeling
crept over Harry as he turned his back on Kingsley. Would he ever see him again? Would he ever
see any of them again? He straightened himself to his full height and resumed his state of readiness
as he moved quietly back up Privet Drive.
He knew what he had to do, the path lay before him, and he would walk that path alone, as he had
done many times before.
~*~*~*~*~
Harry could see the dim glow of light seeping through the small gaps in the curtains as he reached
No.4. Someone was still awake. Harry crept up to the house and with great care, turned the handle
and pushed the door open as quietly as possible, unwilling to give his Uncle yet another opportunity
to start ranting at him, a favourite past time of his.
It seems the Dursleys had decided the best way to repay Harry for inflicting Dumbledore on them
last summer, was to make his life with them even harder for him than before. He suspected that it
had a lot to do with Dumbledore’s comment about their beloved, and hopelessly spoiled dope of a
son Dudley, who in their eyes was a perfect angel who could do no wrong.
He stepped over the threshold then eased the door back into place and released the handle, but no
sooner had he turned to mount the stairs when he saw his Uncle’s stocky figure standing in the
doorway to the kitchen, arms crossed over his rounded stomach. His eye’s glittered dangerously, as
he glared at Harry, a smug satisfaction etched on his face. He had obviously known Harry had snuck
- 3 -
out, and had been waiting there for him, ready to catch him. Harry had the impression of being like
a deer caught in the headlights of a car.
‘I knew you were up to something!’ his uncle said in quiet triumph ‘I said to Petunia you had been
sneaking around, and now …' his eyes narrowed ‘now I’ve got you!’ his barely suppressed glee at
springing Harry was turning his face purple. ‘Where have you been boy?’ he demanded ‘Out
terrorizing the neighbours? Prowling around the streets, causing trouble no doubt!’
Harry thought this was a bit rich.
His cousin Dudley was the biggest thug in the neighbourhood, yet somehow his Aunt and Uncle had
always managed to explain away his behaviour as ‘boisterous youth’ or ‘having a bit of roguish fun’.
But Harry knew the truth; Dudley was a prat.
Uncle Vernon’s eyebrow arched high on his forehead as he approached him, his arm raised and his
finger jutting accusingly at Harry. ‘OUT WITH IT!’ he yelled sharply ‘Where have you been going
every night?’
Harry was mildly astonished that his Uncle was even interested enough in his activities to realize he
had been disappearing off on a regular basis.
A trickle of playful wickedness ran through him.
‘I’ve been reporting to my guard, actually.’ Harry said casually, watching for his Uncle’s reaction. A
deep sense of satisfaction filled Harry as he saw his uncle falter immediately, his face slackening.
Uncle Vernon choked out the word ‘G-Guard?’
‘Yes,’ said Harry ‘that’s right …’ He paused for effect, his Uncles eyes grew wide with uncertainty
‘Guard.’ Harry finally confirmed ‘they’re posted just down the street, been there ever since I got
back from school. You’ve met some of them before … at the station.’
Uncle Vernon looked like he had been hit with a Silencio charm. His lips were trying to form words
but no sound was coming out. Harry was enjoying himself immensely. He knew his uncle would not
have forgotten his encounter with the formidable figure of Mad-eye Moody a year ago. Harry added
with a measured tinge of exasperation ‘They insist I keep them updated with how things are while
I’m here.’ He sighed dramatically. ‘They’re quite overprotective really...’
His Uncle’s lips suddenly fused together, Harry could tell he had not been able to find a single
retort. He was looking everywhere else but at Harry, his arms dangling by his sides as he shifted his
weight uncomfortably. He finally cleared his throat.
‘You’d best get to bed.’ He mumbled without looking at Harry and then he turned and disappeared
into the kitchen without a word, Harry smirking after him.
Strictly speaking, everything Harry said was perfectly true, so he felt no guilt what so ever that he
had unhinged his Uncle. After all, it was only the fact that the Dursley’s were so unkind to him that
gave them cause to worry about his "guard" in the first place.
He headed to his room and sat on the end of his bed, Hedwig hooted softly at him from her perch
atop the cupboard. He looked up at her and smiled. She was the one thing that made being at the
Dursley's bearable.
~*~*~*~
Harry had been planning this night since he had arrived back at the Dursleys, and now that his
chance had come he felt a surge of adrenalin pulse through him. He had some last minute tasks to
do before midnight came, but almost everything he would need, lay in a state of readiness.
Mad-eye Moody had been his main obstacle, his magical eye saw right through almost everything,
including invisibility cloaks, and Harry felt sure Moody could see through the walls into his very
room at times, and on the nights Mad-eye took guard duty, he was quite certain he would not have
- 4 -
been able to slip by him.
Tonight however, Moody was not going to be a problem, and with only Kingsley on for maybe thirty
minutes, he had his chance. Harry knew the guard changed at midnight and he glanced at the
digital clock by his bed. 10.35pm, that would give him about an hour before he was to leave Privet
Drive, forever.
Harry drew in a deep breath as he leapt to his feet. Taking out some parchment and ink from his
desk draw, he sat down and started to write. As the quill scrawled across the page, Hedwig
twittered in anticipation, keen to be put to use again. She had gone out only once in the past eight
days, and that was to deliver a short, hastily written note to Ron that contained nothing of interest.
It was not safe to pass information by owl.
Ron would be back at The Burrow, trying to learn anything he could by stealthily listening in on his
father and Bill.
On the train back from Hogwarts Harry, Ron and Hermione had sat in a compartment they kept to
themselves, conceiving various tactical ways of gathering information while Ron and Hermione were
at The Burrow. Hermione had arranged to stay after spending only a week with her family. They
occasionally looked up when interrupted by Order members who were patrolling the train, or fellow
students like Neville who wandered in. But they were, for the most part, left alone. The loss of
Professor Dumbledore had imparted a sombre mood upon the Hogwarts Express.
Every time the compartment door had slid open, Harry expected - hoped, to see Ginny’s face; he
sat through the train journey back to London feeling like part of him was missing. It was the
beginning of the end of what had been for Harry the most wonderfully comforting thing he had ever
known. His heart would have liked nothing more than to have Ginny sat beside him; the smell of
her hair drifting lazily in the air and the comforting warmth of her body leaned against his. But he
knew she could not be with him, he had made that choice. She understood he had to leave her
behind. She understood he must face this challenge without her. She understood.
Harry looked at the message he had just finished writing, it was as bland as the one he had sent
Ron, but it’s purpose was far more important. He was rolling it up and sealing it when Hedwig
fluttered down from her perch and landed on the desk in front of him. She held out her leg
expectantly. Harry smiled at her affectionately and scratched her neck ‘I’m not sending it yet.’
She nibbled at his finger a little too vigorously and Harry pulled it away ‘Ow!’ he breathed laughing
softly, rubbing the red marks that she had left. She flapped her wings huffily and retreated to her
cage for a drink. ‘You’ll just have to be patient, it wont be long.’ He laid the scroll on his bed and
reached for a knapsack. He had discovered it while searching one of the closets in his room days
before; it had been bought for Dudley to take on a camping trip the Dursleys embarked on many
summers ago. It had lain discarded and forgotten ever since.
Harry bent down and lifted the loose floorboard under his bed. There lay a reasonable store of
provisions that he had managed to collect. He had been sneaking around the house in the gloom of
night using his invisibility cloak. His Aunt Petunia put the missing food down to Dudley’s inability to
stick to his diet; his cousin had frequently left traces of midnight binging strewn from one end of the
kitchen to the other.
One night, because of Dudley's veracious appetite, Harry had almost been sprung.
While heading up to his room after having just raided the pantry for supplies, Harry met Dudley
coming in the opposite direction. He had snuck out of his own room and was descending the stairs,
heading straight for Harry who was concealed under his cloak. The sheer size of Dudley meant there
wasn’t enough room for them to pass one another without Harry making significant contact with
him. Harry was holding some packets of instant porridge, dried peas and some tinned fruit in his
arms, and in his scramble to back down the stairs, he dropped a tin of apricot halves. It fell with a
loud clunk, and then to his dismay, continued to roll down the stairs, Harry's feet dodging it, as he
backed down the steps in an effort to get out of the way of Dudley.
Thunk … thunk … thunk was all his startled cousin heard on the stairway below him. Dudley could
see neither Harry, nor the tin of apricot halves still hidden under the cloak.
- 5 -
When Harry and the tin came to a halt at the bottom of the stairs, he looked up and saw in the
gloomy light from the street lamp outside, the look of sheer terror on his cousins bloodless, white
face. Dudley's lower lip wobbled uncontrollably as he turned, stumbling over himself in his rush to
get back to his room, inaudible squeaks escaping him as he heaved his weight against the door and
slammed it shut.
He did not venture out in the small hours of the morning again, which turned out to be very
convenient for Harry indeed.
Harry shoved some clothing and a bottle of water on top of the food he retrieved from the cavity,
and then packed several other items carefully in the outside pockets of the pack. It was now heavily
bulging as it lay on the bed. He reached in the closet for his broom, and placed it beside the scroll.
He took out the invisibility cloak from his trunk and placed it over the back of the chair, and then
lastly he packed his trunk with everything else he owned. It took him some time to check and
double check that he had packed everything; he could not afford to leave anything behind this time
as he had no intention of ever returning.
Hedwig had been watching him from her cage, her head swivelling this way and that as she followed
him round the room. She let out a small screech as Harry sat down at the desk to write one last
note.
Aunt Petunia,
I want to thank you, for you have done more than you know.
Because of you my mother did not die in vain.
Harry
He placed the parchment squarely in the centre of the desk, stood back and looked to Hedwig.
‘Okay,’ he said quietly raising his arm ‘come here.’ She fluttered down and settled onto Harry’s
outstretched arm. ‘I need you to go to the park and wait for me there Hedwig.’ He said ‘Do you
understand?’ She hooted softly and launched herself out of the window into the night.
Harry locked his trunk, flung the pack on his back, grasped his broom and swung his invisibility
cloak over him.
~*~*~*~
Harry entered the park, tense and alert. He hadn’t needed to pass Shacklebolt because he was
posted at the opposite end of the street, but he was half expecting Tonks to come materializing out
of thin air on top of him, so he quickened his pace as soon as he left the path to number four. The
bulk of his pack and the awkwardness of his broom made it difficult to stay completely concealed
under his cloak, but his need for urgency was overtaking his need for care as he scuffled along
under his cloak.
Harry eyes were constantly on the move, searching for anything out of the ordinary, though he
suspected he was safe for the time being. The Order of the Phoenix would not be looking for
someone leaving the Dursley’s; they were primarily there to stop anything getting in.
The street lamps glowing dully in the mist cast eerie sprawling shadows across the lonesome grass
of the unwelcoming night time park. Hedwig was perched on top of the swings, her large eyes
looking straight at Harry. She had extremely good eyesight at night, and had no doubt seen a part
of Harry’s foot or broom poking carelessly from under his invisibility cloak. He stopped in the
shadow of the large, dense oak tree and removed the cloak, stuffing it into his jacket. Hedwig
plopped down in front of him silently and he bent down to tie the scroll to her leg.
‘Take this to Hagrid’ he said breathlessly ‘Don’t stop for anything, Okay?’ She trilled lightly and took
off in a silent feathery swoop. Harry mounted his Firebolt and sped off after her, into the night.
- 6 -
With any luck The Order wouldn’t discover his absence until the following night when he failed to
make his nightly report. There was a possibility that Moody would take a shift before then and
discover him gone, but Harry had at least twelve hours under his belt in that event. It was the best
he could hope for. A pang of guilt stabbed at him as he tilted his head into the wind, he knew The
Order would be thrown into a state of uproar when they found out, he could picture Lupin’s reaction
when the news got back to Headquarters.
Over the past few weeks Lupin had reluctantly tried to fill Dumbledore’s shoes and Harry had
noticed the strain in his face when his ex-Professor had pulled him aside on the Hogwarts Express to
give him instructions for the summer. Lupin would be racked with guilt and worry when he heard,
but Harry could think of no other way to do what he knew he must.
The wind bit through his jacket as he soared over the hills below. Hedwig was an incredible flyer,
and although Harry had no trouble keeping up with her on his Firebolt, he couldn’t help but marvel
at her skill and determination as he tailed her.
Things would have been much easier if he was seventeen and confident with his disapparating, he
could have apparated near his destination and been there in an instant. But using magic while he
was sixteen at The Dursleys would have brought the ministry down on him immediately, which also
would have alerted The Order, and Harry needed time if this was to work.
Harry was chilled to the bone by the time he started the descent. He had been successfully led to
Hogwarts by Hedwig who was heading straight for the newly restored Hagrid's hut, but Harry could
not risk flying over the castle walls, unsure of the enchantments they held, so he landed near the
edge of the Dark Forest and pulled his cloak back on.
The absence of the brightly lit castle torches which normally sent light streaming out of the
windows, made Hogwarts appear far less welcoming than Harry remembered, and it seemed to him
that the castle itself was lamenting Dumbledores passing.
When he finally rapped on Hagrid’s door, Harry heard Fang launch into a zealous round of barking,
followed by the muffled sound of something breaking within. Hagrid opened the door only inches,
his beetle like eyes staring suspiciously through the gap.
‘Who’s there?’ he grunted
Harry lifted the front of his cloak so only Hagrid would see him, he had not seen anyone else
around, but it was best to be cautious.
‘It’s me.’ He said in a half whisper, ‘Can I come in?’
‘Oh, It’s you.’ Hagrid relaxed for a moment, but as he opened the door to let Harry pass he
suddenly tensed again. ‘Wait a minute! Wha the ‘ell are you doin here?’
‘Ssh!’ said Harry impatiently as he removed his cloak, placed his broom against the inside wall and
proceeded to close all the curtains in the cabin. Hagrid had locked the door and was standing with
his arms on his hips, a look of annoyance plastered across his face.
‘Yeh not s’pose to be here!’ he exclaimed, more quietly this time but his anger still evident. ‘Yer
s’pose to be home where yer safe!’
Harry’s message lay opened on the table near Hedwig who was pecking at a dish of food. He gave
her head an affectionate rub then pulled off his pack and threw it in a corner, planting himself on
one of the huge wooden chairs by the table.
‘I need your help.’ He said, as he looked Hagrid squarely in the eyes. ‘There’s something I’ve got to
do, something that I cant do alone. But it’s very important, and I need your help.’
‘What are yeh talking about? Yeh cant jus walz in here with plans to do something that'll mor’an
likely put yeh in danger again. Yeh can’t jus go sneakin off like that!’ Hagrid waved his arms
pointedly at Harry. He was intensely irritated and if Harry hadn’t known him as well as he did, he
might have feared him right now.
‘I had no choice,’ Harry’s eyes dropped to the ground and he added quietly ‘There was no other
way.’
- 7 -
‘I’m a member of The Order, I am!’ said Hagrid indignantly. ‘Wha are they gonna think when they
discover yer gone, eh?’ Harry felt awful, but he needed to make Hagrid understand, so he looked up
again.
‘Hagrid, please listen to me … this is really important … just hear me out. You know I wouldn’t have
come unless there was no other way.’ And because he didn’t know what else to say, ‘Please Hagrid
… trust me.’
Hagrid heard the plea behind Harry’s voice and his look of anger had gradually turned to one of
concern. He seemed to be going through some sort of internal struggle as he moved over to the
sink and scooped up the broken pieces of a cup.
‘Don’t know what good it’ll do yeh.’ He dumped them in a bin and looked over at Harry ‘I’ve half a
mind to send a message 'n let ‘em, know where yeh are right now!’ He turned his full attention on
Harry who sat slumped in the oversized chair. Hagrid puffed out his chest ‘Not promisin nothin
mind,’ he said ‘but if yeh got somethin to say, I’ll hear yeh out.’
~*~*~*~
‘I need you to take me to Godric's Hollow. I want you to show me where my parents were
murdered.’
Harry watched Hagrid where he stood, and for a moment he wavered, the thought struck him that
Hagrid would never agree to this. Hagrid’s eyes closed for a fraction of a moment as he sighed
heavily, then he pulled out a chair and sat down opposite Harry, he was looking intently at the
tabletop as if searching for the right words.
‘I knew yeh’d wan teh go there one day. Bin expectin it for a while,’ Harry had imagined all sorts of
reactions from Hagrid, but not this. Hagrid finally met Harry’s eyes ‘ever since yeh returned from
the graveyard, in fact. But it’s not somethin’ yeh should be thinkin ‘bout doin right now.’ Hagrid’s
eyes swelled with tears and he looked away again ‘Not now tha Dumbledores gone. It’s not safe
Harry, it’s the sorta place they’d be waitin fer yeh teh turn up.’
‘I have to go Hagrid, I have to know what happened.’ Harry was trying to catch Hagrid’s eye. ‘I
need to see where it all started.’ Hagrid was listening to Harry as though he knew exactly what he
was going to say before he said it. ‘I need to see what’s left behind.’ Harry added quietly. Hagrid
frowned as he looked back at him.
‘What d’yeh mean, left behind?’
Harry was trying to read the look on Hagrid’s face in an effort to decide what he should say next.
‘What’s left of my parents house?’
‘It’s jus as it was the night it happened. The place was pretty much destroyed after Sirius returned
and tha Pettigrew blew up the street. There wern’t much left, but nob'dy was allowed teh go near it
after that, tell yer the truth, nob'dy much wanted to either.’
‘So, no ones been through it since Voldemort was there? No one at all?’ Harry asked.
‘Dumbledore wen there teh put a block on it. Magic teh stop curious folk from wanderin in there.
Guess he thought it might be dangerous still, or maybe he thought it was a fittin memorial, I don't
know, but like I says ‘Arry, it’s not the sorta place yeh wanna be rushin off to now.’
Harry sighed and looked away. ‘I have to go, it’s something I’ve got to do.’ He was talking more to
himself as he studied Hedwig, but then he looked back to Hagrid ‘And I’ll go with or without your
help, if I have to.’
Hagrid was slowly shaking his head, his eyes on the table again ‘Yer goin to stay here until The
Order come and get yer, I cant let yeh do it Harry, I’m sorry. I understand why yeh wanna go, but
it’s not safe, I’ll send ‘em a message 'n let ‘em know yer here-’ He started to rise from his chair, but
Harry leapt to his feet and had his wand out so fast that Hagrid stopped, one arm still resting on the
- 8 -
table, eyeing the slightly shaking wand now aimed at him.
‘I’m going Hagrid, one way or another.’ Harry’s voice was shaking but he was determined to see this
through. Hagrid drew himself to his full height as Harry gulped before adding, ‘You can either help
me, or step aside’
Hagrid did not seemed perturbed by Harry’s wand; on the contrary, he was looking at Harry with
what looked like pity. They stood across the table from one another for a time, neither speaking,
but a change was gradually overcoming Hagrid.
‘Firs’ly, I know yeh wont use that thing on me so yeh migh as well put it away, and secondly’ Hagrid
reached into a cupboard and pulled out a plate of rock cakes ‘Better have somethin to eat, it’s a way
teh the Hollow and we don't know how long we’ll be gone.’
~*~*~*~
A short time later the two of them were hurrying across the grounds, the sun was almost up and
Harry, hidden under his cloak, was having a job to keep up with Hagrid’s gigantic strides. When
they arrived at a battered old wooden shed near the greenhouses, Hagrid pulled out a key ring that
jangled loudly with what must have been over a hundred keys, all of different shapes and sizes. He
fumbled through them for a moment then seemed to find the one he was looking for. As the old
door swung open they entered into complete darkness, Harry took out his wand and lifted the cloak.
‘Lumos’
There were no windows and the atmosphere in the shed was thick and dusty as if it hadn’t been
opened in years. There was an assortment of odd wooden carvings scattered across the workbench
and unusual leather straps dangled here and there from the ceiling. There were several rusty old
cages of different sizes and strengths stacked against the walls, and in the very back corner stood a
large dark motorcycle.
Hagrid grabbed a scrap of cloth and brushed the seat, a cloud of dust and grit filled the air and
Harry spluttered, waving his hand around trying to disperse it.
‘The last trip this bike did was teh take you from yer parents house to your Aunt and Uncles.’ Hagrid
looked down at Harry ‘and now sixteen years on, it’s goin to take yeh back to the beginning again,’
Hagrid raised his eyebrows dubiously ‘if we can get it goin o‘course!’
'This is Sirius's bike?' Harry looked at it as a pang shot through him.
'Yup! Kept it here all these years. Don't have much use for it meself, don't go anywhere I might
need it. Still ere it is!' Hagrid patted it fondly. 'You know, come teh think of it, it'd be your bike
now.' He leaned over it and winked at Harry, 'You want teh drive it?'
'No!' Harry said quickly, 'I mean, I don't have a license.'
'Well, yer in good company then,' Hagrid smiled. 'Nor do I!'
Minutes later the bike was rumbling loudly and Harry scooted onto it’s back behind Hagrid.
‘Nox’ he said as he replaced his wand, careful to tuck his cloak around himself, keeping his feet well
hidden. The biked jerked suddenly, then rolled out into the early dawn rays, Harry grasping the
pillion bar tightly.
‘Yer alright Harry?’ Hagrid asked over his shoulder.
‘Yeah.’
Hagrid weaved between the greenhouses and headed towards the gate, once through he turned the
bike South and accelerated. Harry felt the front wheel lift and a moment later the rear left the
ground as well and they were ascending rapidly as Hagrid steered them over the forest.
They sailed along at a great height for what seemed like hours to Harry, it was almost impossible to
talk to Hagrid over the sound of the wind and the grumbling engine, so his thoughts strayed to
other people and places.
- 9 -
He had told Ron and Hermione of his plans to return to Godric's Hollow so he knew they would be
expecting this, and he had sworn them to secrecy, so when they were questioned by Mr. Weasley,
(as he knew they would be) they would put on a plausible act of innocence while denying any
knowledge of his whereabouts.
Ginny, on the other hand had no idea, though because she was always quick on the uptake, Harry
suspected she would know he was up to something by Ron and Hermione's reactions. It made him
feel better knowing that she was smart enough to figure out when something was really wrong, and
he was reassured by the thoughts of seeing her again when the wedding came. He knew he would
not be able to touch her, or seek the solace he had found in her arms, but he would look upon her
again and that would be enough.
The sun was high in the sky when they started their descent, and it wasn’t long before Hagrid had
found a suitable place to land; a clearing near the edge of a pine forest. They walked some miles to
the edge of town, Harry looking about him from under his invisibility cloak. As the houses became
more frequent and shops started to spring up, Harry began to notice things about the town that
were remarkably familiar.
2. Back To The Beginning
The streets began to fill with people the closer they were to the centre of town, and Hagrid was
attracting a variety of looks from the passers-by, not the least being a sort of stunned gaze that
followed him as they were unable to stop themselves from turning their heads as they gaped after
his enormous bulk. But Hagrid lumbered along the footpath, bending very low every now and then
to avoid hitting his head on a shop awning, Harry alongside him under his cloak.
Some pedestrians automatically gave Hagrid a wide berth, even taking the trouble to cross the
street before continuing on their way, however there were one or two very old people who merely
looked slightly surprised when they noticed him, and went back to chatting to who ever they were
with, or scanning the shop windows with great interest.
Godric’s Hollow was the greenest and prettiest place Harry had ever seen. He had noticed on the
walk in, the grassy fields had seemed particularly lush, and the trees almost too tall, as if every
living thing was thriving. Closer to town every nook and cranny was filled with the richest lush
foliage or peppered with an array of dazzling colourful flowers. Even the people looked unusually
healthy and bright.
You couldn’t have asked for a cleaner looking hub, and although many of the buildings were
obviously very old, they were lovingly looked after, none of the flaking paintwork or cracked bricks
that you might ordinarily expect. It was almost as if the buildings were in some sort of time warp
while everything else carried on around them. But it wasn’t just the beauty of this town that caught
Harry’s eye.
The "Welcome To Godric’s Hollow" sign was the first hint of what lay in wait. It was in the form of a
shield, painted richly in red and gold, with the formidable Gryffindor Lion rearing up on hind legs,
mouth open and teeth bared in mid roar with its claws out stretched. ‘Population – 2297’ it said in
Gold Lettering across the bottom. Over some of the oldest buildings, moulded into the keystone
brick that was common in the archways was the distinctive mark of the lion once more, some had
abandoned the red and gold colour scheme, but many were very much still icons of Gryffindor.
Small bronze lions were mounted atop railing ends and the shield was repeated several times
throughout the streets signs.
In the very centre of town was a marble statue, it would have been close to 15 feet in height and
was surrounded by a garden bed of vibrant red and golden-yellow flowers. The bearded man stood
proud and tall, wearing what could have been a travelling cloak, and a hat with a wide brim, which
tapered up to a point that sagged gently to one side. His left arm was held aloft, his hand cupped
loosely as if holding something of great importance, his right hand rested on a the hilt of a sword,
the tip of the blade on the ground. Harry did not need to look at the plaque at the base of the
- 10 -
statue to know that this was Godric Gryffindor,
As they neared it Hagrid spoke ‘Guess yeh know who tha is.’ Nodding at the impressive stone
figure.
‘Yeah,’ said Harry as he looked around him to make sure no one was close. ‘This was a wizard town
once, wasn’t it.’
‘Yep! Long time ago though, bin muggles here for centuries now, but there are still wizards here
n’all.’ Hagrid said looking about him ‘It’s them that looks after the town mostly, they keeps it true.’
‘True?’
‘Don’t know if yeh noticed but things don’t exactly age here like they do elsewhere.’ Hagrid looked
at the statue of Godric and added ‘He was a very powerful wizard by all accounts, set up all sorts of
enchantments on the area teh keep it from gettin spoiled. He wanted to make sure it would remain
true to Gryffindor here long after he’d gone. His family lived here fer generations, buildin it up, kept
the enchantments goin. Mostly older wizards here now though, they stay in memory of ‘im.’ Hagrid
put a hand up to his eyes and looked into the sun hovering in the sky. ‘It’s goin teh be dark in a
couple of hours so we’d better get a move on.’
Harry turned away from the marble man and followed Hagrid down the road, winding further and
further through the quaint older style houses. As the sun dipped lower the buildings glowed and
shadows crept across the road. The landscape took on an almost surreal appearance but the beauty
of it was all but wasted on Harry. He was aware of only one thing. He was almost at the place where
Voldemort had destroyed his family.
When they rounded Achilles Lane the change in their surroundings was instant. Instead of the
delicate garden beds and cosy cottages they had just passed, the houses lay abandoned, distinctly
grey in appearance and lacking any trace of warmth or homeliness. The occasional For Sale sign
was stuck in an overgrown garden and there was neither light nor sound coming from any of the
windows.
Then suddenly, there it was.
Harry looked out on the devastation before him and he knew he had arrived. Hagrid stopped in front
of the ruin and cleared his throat. He looked to where he thought Harry ought to be, but said
nothing.
Harry removed his cloak and stared out at the scene, a stony look on his face. There was a corner
section of a room with part of the ceiling still attached, jutting out of piles of rubble, the only trace
that a house once stood there. He gazed at it for a moment, unaware of his cloak sliding from his
slackening grip to the ground.
He started to move slowly towards the ruin, not thinking about the block Dumbledore had placed on
it, not thinking that at any moment he would be repelled backwards. One foot in front of the other
as if in a trance, he made his way to where it had all began. He could vaguely hear Hagrid’s voice
behind him but he could not stop himself, he stepped beyond the tiny white gate and amongst the
broken bricks.
He made his way to the partially standing room, scanning the wreckage as he went, unsure of what
he was looking for, every now and then something caught his eye, but when he bent to investigate
it was pieces of broken glass glittering in the light, or fragments of plaster and wallpaper. He
stopped before the wall and looked up at the sagging ceiling, then beyond to the sky. He didn’t have
much time before sunset, so he closed himself to everything but the task at hand.
‘Harry!’ he looked over to where Hagrid was yelling to him from outside the gate. ‘Harry, I think yeh
should come back, I can’t get past the block!’ Hagrid looked as if he were pressed against a pain of
glass. His cheek and lips were distorted as he pushed himself into the invisible barrier, straining to
get through.
As Harry watched, it struck him that Dumbledore had protected this site from everyone entering,
except him. Either Dumbledore knew Harry would want to come back or he was intending to bring
him here himself.
- 11 -
‘It’s Okay, Hagrid.’ He said loudly ‘don’t worry … I think Dumbledore wanted me to come back here.’
He looked around him ‘It’ll be dark soon anyway… just wait for me … I wont be long.’
Hagrid stopped struggling and sat on the low rock wall on the street, ‘Jus hurry up.’ He said ‘Don’t
wanna be here longer than we have teh be.’ Then added ‘What yeh looking fer anyway?’
‘I don’t know,’ answered Harry feeling his way along the wall ‘I don’t know.’ He added quietly under
his breath as he bent down to sift through the rubble.
~*~*~*~
The sun had disappeared behind the trees at the end of the street long ago; the moon shed only the
dullest of light. Harry hands were scratched and bleeding in places and his clothes were covered in
powder from the bricks and plaster, but the only things he found were useless broken pieces of
metal and other building materials.
After a long while he sat himself down on a chunk of wood, looking over at Hagrid who was still
sitting on the wall, though he was slumped and looked as if he might be asleep. Harry put his
elbows on his knees, and lowering his head, he brushed his hands through his hair, breathing
heavily.
Nothing. Not a single thing left! Harry felt frustrated and disappointed. He was sure there would
have been something of them here, a small trinket, a picture, clothes, anything! He rubbed his face
trying to quash the emptiness that was growing inside him, shuddering as the cold night air
penetrated him. How could he have been so stupid, dragging Hagrid all this way for nothing? He
was feeling worse by the second and emptiness seemed to consume him as he pulled his cloak
around him. It was as if a cold, dead claw had wrapped itself around Harry's heart - squeezing the
hope and light from it. A soft mist was gently emerging from his mouth.
The whole thing had been pointless.
All hope left him.
His darkness felt complete.
With a sudden realization, Harry jerked his head up. He leapt from his squatting position and pulled
out his wand. With lightening speed, he scrambled towards Hagrid, desperately searching the dark
skies above him as his heart caved in fear.
‘Hagrid!’ he yelled ‘HAGRID!’ he heard Hagrid snort as he stirred ‘HAGRID!’
But before Harry could reach him a mass of floating black cloaks were closing in on Hagrid from all
sides.
Knowing what to do, Harry reached inside and pulled a day spent with Ginny down by the lake to his
thoughts. ‘Expecto Patronum!’ Harry yelled as the memory flooded him, his arm outstretched and
his wand gripped tightly. A perfect, giant silver stag leapt from the end of his wand and rushed at
the Dementors. It raced towards them with it’s head down, antlers forward, but as it hit the magical
block that Hagrid had been unable to get through it dissolved into nothing.
Harry was struggling over the debris trying desperately to reach Hagrid who was flailing his
umbrella around hopelessly.
‘Expecto Patronum!’ Once again the stag erupted from Harry’s wand and rushed at the Dementors,
and again it dissipated when it hit the block. Hagrid let out an awful moan as he dropped to the
ground.
~*~*~*~
- 12 -
Harry flung himself over the gate.
‘Expecto Patronum!’ His heartbeat raced as the great silver stag burst forth and charged. This time
it made contact and ploughed through Dementor after Dementor.
‘TO HAGRID!’ Harry yelled, pointing urgently at the enormous motionless figure sprawled on the
ground. ‘Get them away from him!’ Harry was rushing up behind his patronus as it cleared the way
and now that he was out of the magical block, he could hear the dreadful hollow sucking breaths the
bony, cloaked figures emitted. Dementors seemed to just keep coming, closing ranks behind Harry
and the stag as they reached Hagrid.
‘Keep them back!’ Harry yelled over his shoulder as he crouched down over Hagrid gripping the
front of his coat, shaking him ‘Hagrid! Hagrid!’ Hagrid moaned and strained to open his eyes.
‘Get back … behind … the block … Harry!’ he breathed, barely conscious. Harry looked up and saw
the stag running in a circle around them, only just managing to keep the shadowy figures at bay.
Dementors were pressing in on them relentlessly and Harry knew they could not be held off forever
by his patronus. There were too many of them.
Hagrid was trying to raise his head up but lacked the strength, his eyes were only half open as he
looked out at the flowing black cloaks and his body trembled from the icy coldness the Dementors
inflicted.
‘Get … back’ he was struggling to talk ‘behind … the block’
‘It’s alright … it’s okay …’ Harry was saying to Hagrid ‘They can’t get to us.’ But he looked back out
at the hooded figures swarming all around them. It was only a matter of time before his patronus
would fade then they would be sitting ducks, he wouldn’t even have enough time to conjure another
one before they swooped in on them. He looked down at Hagrid.
‘Harry … get … back -’
‘I’m not leaving you Hagrid!’ Harry cut in abruptly, then more softly he added ‘stop trying to talk.’
His mind raced, he had no idea how he was going to do it, but he was not going to let Hagrid have
his soul sucked out by a Dementor; he was going to get them both out of there.
CRACK!
All of a sudden, several loud popping noises sounded beyond the black swirling dome that enclosed
them. Harry's stomach lurched as a feeling of dread flooded him. Death Eaters!
He heard loud voices but couldn’t make out what they were saying. He closed his eyes. I should
never have come. I should never have persuaded Hagrid to come. He trusted me! He opened his
eyes again and stood up. A new strength took hold and any fear abandoned him as he set himself to
defend his friend with his last breath.
It appeared the Dementors were being called off so the Death Eaters could take over, the ones on
the outer edge were falling away rapidly and it wouldn’t be long before Harry would be face to face
with Voldemort’s cronies, or maybe even Lord Voldemort himself.
For a moment it seemed the Dementors had been caught by surprise, they jerked suddenly, like
swarming fish avoiding circling sharks, turning their backs on Harry, and then a change came over
them. They scattered, some darting away up into the sky while others appeared to be dropping
away, as if knocked down. A gap opened up before him and Harry realized what was happening.
A large silver animal, a goat patronus was charging down Dementors with ease, and to Harry's left
and right he caught sight of more silver patronuses, one that looked like a large wild cat, the other
an enormous vulture, all of them clearing the way as three very old wizards in white robes, two with
long silvery beards and the other almost completely hairless, rushed up to where Harry stood over
Hagrid.
‘Are you … alright?’ the skinny bearded one panted breathlessly, bent over clutching his knees.
‘I’m fine, but they attacked Hagrid before I could get to him.’ Harry watched the other two wizards
recall their patronuses now that the last of the Dementors had gone, Harry’s stag turned to him but
- 13 -
faded into the darkness as it approached his outstretched hand, finally at the end of it’s power. The
biting cold eased to a mild calm night once more.
He turned back to Hagrid and crouching over him said ‘It’s alright Hagrid, they’re gone now.’ Hagrid
was beginning to recover, his giant blood providing far more resilience to the Dementors than
ordinary people. Harry looked over his shoulder ‘Don’t suppose you have some chocolate handy?’
‘What was … all that … about?’ Wheezed the dumpy bearded wizard in a grainy voice, looking at
Harry. Slowly comprehension dawned on his face; he had probably recognized Harry from his photo
in the paper. Harry doubted his scar was visible in the dim light.
‘You!’ he breathed ‘Wha … what are you doin here?’ his eyes wide, but even before Harry had a
chance to answer the little bald wizard cut in.
‘Now why would ya be needin to ask a question like that for, Fudd?’ he had a look of exasperation
on his face as he threw his arm in the direction of Harry’s parents house.
‘Eh?’ Fudd said screwing his face up and cupping his hand behind one ear ‘Whadya say?’
‘Look where we bleedin well are, for goodness sake!’ the other wizard answered loudly ‘Whadya
think he’s doin here? On ‘oliday doin a bit a sightseein?’ he said gruffly and rolled his eyes ‘Doddery
old bludger.’ He added not too quietly.
‘I ‘eard that.’ Said Fudd.
‘Oh, so ya heard that alright!’ said the second man giving Fudd a sideways glance.
‘Eh … what?’ the plump man was making it obvious he was having trouble hearing again. ‘What was
that?’
‘Never mind!’ the bald man said loudly in frustration.
‘I do not think it is wise to stand here bickering amongst ourselves.’ Interrupted the thin bearded
wizard, his voice was old and cracked but firm ‘We had best leave here as soon as possible.’ He
gave the other two wizards a silencing look. ‘They may very well return and in even greater
numbers. Mr. Potter, you and your friend will come with us for now,’ he said motioning the others to
help get Hagrid to his feet. ‘You can go no further tonight, I think’
Harry helped rouse Hagrid who stumbled to his feet, listing to the side. He was grey behind his
bushy beard and looked very weak so Harry did his best to help support him. It was backbreaking
work as they walked back down the street, but Hagrid was slowly regaining his composure and
easing Harry’s burden as they went.
'Who are you?' Harry asked.
‘We must make haste,’ the old wizard glanced at Harry ‘there will be time for introductions later.’
Harry could see the wizards face in the street lamp as they passed, he looked incredibly old; his
face was full of lines and his hair was ghostly white, he was glancing about him as he moved down
the street and like the others was still brandishing a wand.
They hurried along a tree lined avenue where the dwellings were made from large grey stone bricks
and were spaced well apart, all had sweeping lawns that surrounded regal looking buildings and as
they neared a large gold iron gate they drew to a halt.
There was no house here that Harry could see, it looked more like a park of some sorts, though it
was definitely private going by the enormous walls on either side of the entrance that blocked it
from view. The ghostly wizard motioned to Harry and Hagrid so they leant in.
‘Gryffindor’s Seventh on Hollow.’ he whispered.
From out of nowhere an enormous stone mansion began to expand before their eyes, nudging aside
giant old knarley trees and small flowering shrubs. Harry had experienced this once before when he
had been taken to Gimmauld Place, Sirius’s family home. It, like this place, was a protected site,
unplottable and unknown by any who were not given the address by the secret keeper.
Hagrid started at the sight before him and the old man smiled faintly ‘Dandelion.’ he said. The gates
- 14 -
parted and as they approached the large stone manor, Harry noticed an ornate Gryffindor emblem
upon the enormous oaken doors. The building itself was rather plain and unassuming, something
the other houses along this road were not.
‘You get the door, Waldo’ said Fudd loudly as he and Harry struggled to keep Hagrid from swaying
on his unsteady feet. The little bald wizard muttered something under his breath and ran the tip of
his wand lightly along the crack where the double doors joined in the middle of the two massive
cast iron handles shaped like lions. There were several loud clunks and the doors swung slowly
inwards, creaking loudly as Harry guided Hagrid through the entrance.
‘This way,’ said the thin bearded man, motioning his hand as he entered a small room just off the
entry. Hagrid dropped onto a bench seat that lay beneath the main window and Harry sat himself
down on the arm of a leather chair nearby, surveying the scene.
The room had a distinctly cosy feel to it. Harry gave an involuntary shudder, his brush with the
Dementors sat in stark contrast to the welcoming surroundings he now found himself in. A crackling
fire blazed in an old blackened stone fireplace on the far wall, casting warm flecks of orange light
around the room and the circular iron chandelier that hung from the high ceiling was laden with
burning candles illuminating the furnishings which appeared as old as the wizards who now sat in
them.
‘Oi … Sooty!’ Waldo said suddenly, his eyes searching the air around him. A second later a small
figure appeared in middle of the room, it was immediately recognizable as a house elf, but it
appeared to be much younger than the house elves Harry had seen, its skin was uncharacteristically
wrinkle free.
It had large grey eyes and a small nose that looked like an unripe strawberry, it was wearing a red
and gold kilt that hung from its chest and was fidgeting where it stood.
It realized after an exasperated look from Waldo that it had materialized on top of the coffee table
and it let out an apologetic oops! Before jumping down onto the rug.
‘Yes … er … sir?’ It squeaked anxiously.
‘Right,’ said Waldo shifting in his chair ‘bring some tea for our guests ... and chocolate … and don’t
forget the sugar pot this time…’ and then added ‘or the milk … or the tea for that matter.’
‘No sir … I mean yes sir.’ It said sheepishly then it turned and trotted out of the room.
‘It’d be a miracle if she brings cups.’ Fudd grumbled from the corner near the fire, rolling his eyes
exaggeratingly as he put his feet up on the stool before him.
‘So Emerick, what do we do now?’ asked Waldo sitting back in his chair and tapping a pipe on a
small round dish he had picked up from the side table.
The thin bearded wizard who had remained standing walked over to the fireplace, bent down and
began prodding the fire with a metal poker, sending sparks soaring up the chimney. He turned and
looked at Hagrid and Harry.
‘Sooty will make you a room each for the night. You will be safe here until morning at least,
however,’ he looked directly at Harry from under his brow ‘You-Know-Who will be aware of your
presence here by now and there will almost certainly be some of his minions in the Hollow seeking
you. I advise you not to attempt to return to Achilles Lane under any circumstances.’
Harry dropped his eyes to the worn rug at his feet. Disappointment washed over him again at the
thoughts that his search had turned up nothing, and he was beginning to feel extremely guilty for
bringing Hagrid with him. He was beginning to see it as a rather selfish endeavour after all.
Emerick turned and stared into the flames, the glowing flickers danced across his face. ‘We were
fortunate tonight. You must have caught them off guard, they were not monitoring the site as
closely as I would have expected. Next time…’ he said as he turned back to Harry ‘you will not be so
lucky.’
‘Lucky?’ said Hagrid credulously. Harry’s stomach churned as he thought of the swarm of
- 15 -
Dementors that had enclosed Hagrid and himself; he couldn’t imagine how much worse it could get,
yet he felt inclined to listen to Emerick, he reminded Harry a little of the wise and gentle
Dumbledore whom he had always trusted.
A tinkle of silver announced Sooty's return. She was clutching a tray that for some reason Harry
found himself checking the contents of. It held a large silver pot with steam rising from it, five cups,
a tub of sugar, a milk jug, and a slab of chocolate. He felt some relief that she appeared to have
remembered everything and was turning back to Emerick when her rather large foot caught the leg
of the cloak stand, and with an almighty crash Sooty went flying face down onto the floor, the stand
tumbling over behind her and burying her in clothing. The contents of the tray spewed out over the
rug.
Harry automatically jumped to his feet to help her. He yanked the clothing off her, pulling her up by
the arm. She was tittering nervously and Harry could hear Fudd mumbling ‘… useless … couldn’t dry
a dish in a desert …’ Emerick had pulled out his wand and with a double wave the tray right sided
itself and the tea set jumped back into place, the mess of tea, sugar, milk and chocolate
disappeared from the carpet and the tray finally settled on the small table.
‘Not to worry Sooty, why don’t you see if you can get two rooms ready for Mr. Potter and his friend,
Mm?’ She nodded brushing herself off and started to leave but then she stopped suddenly in her
tracks.
Sooty looked around at Harry who was watching her with a bemused grimace on his face; it was a
bit like waiting for an accident to happen. Sooty’s eyes suddenly became wide with wonder.
‘M-M-Mr. Potter?’ she stammered ‘H-Harry Potter?’ she went on ‘The H-Harry P-Potter?’ she seemed
unable to grasp the enormity of it and although Harry had gotten used to peoples reactions to him,
he was feeling slightly uncomfortable at Sooty’s awe; it felt akin to having a female Dobby staring
at him.
‘Yes,’ smiled Emerick looking rather amused at the both of them.
‘Harry Potter!’ she breathed. Harry was looking at the fire to hide his embarrassment though at
least she could say his name without stammering now. ‘James and Lily’s son!’
Harry’s head spun round. ‘What?’
‘Y-Your James and Lily's son!’ she turned, her mouth gaping as she breathed heavily looking at
Emerick but pointing to Harry. ‘Harry Potter ... James and Lily's son!’
Emerick chuckled faintly ‘Yes Sooty,’ he said as if he were speaking to a child ‘This is Harry Potter,
James and Lily’s son.’ She gave another gasp as though hearing the idea from Emerick for the first
time.
Harry’s heartbeat raced at the mention of his mother and father; the very reason he had come to
Godric’s Hollow in the first place. He looked from Sooty to Emerick, to Waldo and Fudd trying to
read their faces. Sooty looked flummoxed, Emerick was smiling faintly and Waldo and Fudd were
regarding him with interest but neither had moved; Waldo was puffing out a billowy cloud of smoke
and Fudd had his finger in his ear jiggling it to and fro apparently trying to clear out some
obstruction so he could hear better.
All of a sudden a loud snort came from behind him and Harry realized before he had even turned,
that Hagrid had fallen asleep, the drain of the Dementors finally catching up with him. Harry turned
back to Emerick.
‘You knew my parents?’ there was a tinge of desperation in his voice; he could hardly bring himself
to hope that coming to Godric’s Hollow had not been in vain.
‘Yes, Harry’ said Emerick ‘myself in particular new your mother and father rather well.’
~*~*~*~
Harry undressed carelessly in the silvery moonlight and slipped under the cool white cotton bed
- 16 -
covers. He lay with his hands behind his head gazing up at the flickering shadows on the ceiling as
an ancient willow outside the open window swayed gently in the breeze. The yellowed heavy lace
curtains flapped gently as a wisp of air gently wafted through and played over Harry’s untidy hair.
Somewhere in the distance a chorus of frogs were trying to outdo their cricket counterparts,
croaking and gurgling fervently.
He breathed deeply as his thoughts churned, he had expected to be overcome with emotion at what
Emerick and the others had told him, he had expected to feel elated or sorrowful at what they had
to say, but instead the time spent listening about his parents had left him numb.
Harry turned his head to the small black chest that crouched on the bedside cabinet. When Emerick
had handed it to him at the foot of the stairs, Harry had assumed it contained nightclothes and
wash things for the morning, instead Emerick revealed it contained all that was salvaged of his
mother and father’s things after Voldemort had murdered them.
He stared at it for a moment, studying its outline in the gloomy din, wondering why he couldn’t
bring himself to open it. Turning back to the ceiling he closed his eyes. Nothing had gone at all like
imagined; Hagrid had put up far less resistance than he had expected, Harry alone had been able to
walk straight through the magical block to gain entrance to the ruin, they had both been swamped
by countless Dementors in the middle of the street and then rescued by three ancient wizards who,
as it turned out, knew his mother and father personally, and then just when he’d given up hope of
ever finding anything of his parents possessions, out of the blue he had been handed the very thing
he had struggled so desperately through all this for.
What confused Harry the most was how he could lie there feeling so detached from everything.
Emerick had spent some time recalling his visits with Lily and James. Waldo and Fudd chimed in
with little details every now and then as apparently the three of them were his parents only regular
visitors during their time in hiding at Godric’s Hollow. They had in turn spent many an afternoon
keeping Lily and her baby company when James was absent.
Emerick had remarked several times on what an extraordinarily talented witch his mother was, and
Fudd had said she was ‘the sweetest lass’ he had ever had the fortune to meet, he said Lily had an
excellent sense of humour which made visiting with her one of the things he most looked forward
to. Waldo had told how she doted on her baby boy who was always smiling incessantly up at her,
and Emerick said she was often to be found in the sunroom, sitting in a large armchair with her
sleeping baby curled into her chest, staring out the window waiting for James to return.
It seemed they also highly regarded James. Waldo described him as a very intelligent and
extremely likable young wizard who had a nose for trouble but a heart the size of a Hogwarts when
it came to his beautiful wife and son. Fudd described how James always went to great lengths to
make sure Lily and their son were well taken care of when he could not be with them.
He said although James never complained, he could tell he hated leaving them and would not go
until he had checked over everything at least three or four times. Emerick had added sombrely that
James had a great courage and strength in him that few could lay claim to, but the tension of hiding
from Voldemort had started to show in him near the end; he said James had looked tired and
strained the last time he had seen him.
Emerick suspected James carried the great burden of knowing far more than he was letting on; he
thought it quite possible that some disturbing information had surfaced in the days before
Voldemort attacked. Emerick had held Harry’s look when he added quietly that James had done
everything he could to protect Lily and his child that night, and that his skill and sheer nerve had
managed to hold Voldemort off for some time. Harry had wanted to ask how he knew that, but
Sooty had interrupted them by materializing inside the wood store cabinet by accident, Emerick
hurried to let her out when she started screeching in panic and pounding on the doors with her bony
fists; apparently claustrophobic.
Harry did not feel like sleeping at all. His mind ran over and over every last detail they had told him
about James and Lily to make sure he would not forget any of it. As he lay there in the quiet Harry
heard the latch on his door click and he turned onto his elbow as a small shadow emerged though
the slight gap in the open doorway.
- 17 -
‘Sooty?’ said Harry
‘Yes Mr. Potter,’ came a small squeaky voice, when she stepped into the moonlight Harry frowned.
‘What’s wrong?’
She was looking decidedly nervous and was wringing her long bony fingers together.
‘I is sorry to disturb you sir, but I is thinking you would still be awake sir …’ she looked at Harry
through her wide grey eyes which looked rather watery.
‘Yeah,’ said Harry quietly as he shuffled into an upright position securing the sheets around him as
he went. ‘What’s up?’
‘I is not knowing how to tell you this Mr. Potter … so, I is thinking I should just say it …’ she looked
extremely tense. Harry waited a moment and when nothing was forthcoming he said ‘Say what,
Sooty?’
‘I is not a very good house elf Mr. Potter, I is very clumsy and always gets it’s wrong.’ Her eyes
were on her feet ‘But I is very good with the little peeps as with the old ones because they is so
much alike,’ Harry wasn’t sure he understood.
‘What are little peeps?’
Her eyes grew wider still; she leant into him and whispered conspiratorially ‘I is helping Lily
sometimes with her little peep.’
Harry’s felt his stomach lurch, ‘you stayed with my mother? But your too young aren’t you?’
‘I is young for a house elf sir, yes but that is still many of your years. My masters said to go to Lily
and keep her company sometimes, so Sooty is doin it sir.’ She said ‘Lily is good mistress sir, she is
good to Sooty, so Sooty is doin everythin she asks. She asks me to sneak stuff for her so I is doin
it.’ She lifted her hand to her mouth gave a nervous giggle.
Harry frowned ‘Sneak stuff? What sort of stuff?’ He felt an ache growing in the pit of his stomach.
‘Stuff for doin big magic Mr. Potter.’ She said in awe
Harry screwed his face up ‘But why would she need to sneak stuff to do magic? She was a qualified
witch, it doesn’t make sense.’
‘She is not wanting James to find out sir.’
‘Why would she be hiding it from him?’ Harry shot her a look ‘They were happy together weren’t
they?’ Harry would never have dreamed of asking this of anyone else, but for some reason he did
not feel uncomfortable asking Sooty.
‘Ooh yes Mr. Potter!’ she nodded ‘they is very happy together! I is seein them many times
together,’ she blushed and added with a whimper ‘Lily is loving James more than anything! And he
is loving her back so much he is crying once.’
Harry swallowed hard ‘Crying?’
‘He is crying once when he is alone sir, he is scared for Lily and little peep sir.’ Her eyes filled with
tears ‘He is good man sir, he is not knowing Sooty is there at first then he is telling me not to say
anything to Lily, so I says nothink.’ She waved hands despairingly
Harry’s insides felt like they were dissolving; he felt guilty that he had intruded on his father’s grief.
He turned his eyes to the bed sheet and searched for something to say so he did not have to think
of his father crying ‘What was she hiding from him?’
‘She is making big magic, she tells Sooty it will protect her little peep.’ Sooty wailed softly. Harry
instinctly withdrew, leaning back onto the pillows; unsure he wanted to hear the rest. ‘She is very
clever witch Mr. Potter and she is telling James she can make magic from her own death if’ she
lowered her voice tears streaming down her face ‘He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named finds her peep.’ An
awful dread came over Harry as he listened, stony faced.
‘She is pleading with him to get her what she needs and he is forbidding her to do it, he is telling
her she is not to do it, no matter what, she is not to put herself in harms way and she is not to
- 18 -
mention it again.’ Sooty looked frightened and it struck Harry how desperate his father had
sounded. ‘Then he goes to another room where Sooty is and locks the door’ Harry’s eyes stung as
he swallowed hard. ‘This is when Sooty sees him crying alone. He is good man sir!’ fresh tears
swelled in her eyes
‘so you got the things she needed?' Harry said in a heavy voice. 'You got the things for my mum?’
‘Yes Mr. Potter’ she lifted the back of her hand to wipe her wet face ‘She is doin it anyway because
she loves her little peep so much.’
Harry turned to look out the window as a warm tear trickled down his cheek. He had never known
such sadness as overcame him hearing of his mother and fathers desperation. Harry wished he felt
numb again now.
3. The Last Day Of Peace?
Harry lay with his arm over his face. Sooty had left him feeling like he might burst, but now it was
almost dawn and Harry felt completely drained. He had spent the earlier part of the evening wishing
he felt more of an emotional connection to his parents, now all he wanted was for it to stop. The
feelings that flooded him had quietly poured out as he lay in the moonlight; he had found the
connection he was looking for to his mother and father, and he finally understood them.
The James Harry had seen in the pensieve had unnerved him, he had not at all been what Harry
would have liked, he had seemed too human in his failings to Harry then, but now he finally
understood; he accepted that his dad was very human and he had loved his family so much that he
died trying to save them. And his mother Lily, Voldemort would have left alive, but she too had
stood between him and her son and died to save him.
As the predawn grey of the morning filled his room, Harry got out of bed and pulled on his clothes.
He went over to the small basin and scooped some water over his face, looking at his reflection in
the mirror as he picked up the small hand towel and rubbed his face with it.
He studied himself for a moment, expressionless. He looked tired and drawn. A lifetimes worth of
anguish and sorrow had flowed out overnight and now he was an empty shell. He moved over to the
window and looked out at the dawn's rays as they splayed out across the lawn, it was a new
beginning. Dumbledore's words came back to him.
‘…the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! … you, yourself, will never rest until you’ve
tried! …. He will continue to hunt you…’
He breathed deeply; a new acceptance had risen within him along with the day’s sun. Harry no
longer feared his own weakness; he knew what he had to do. He would face Voldemort when the
time came and Harry would end his reign of terror, or he would die trying. He owed his mum and
dad that at least.
Harry picked up the chest from beside the bed and went downstairs. Peering into the sitting room
where he had left Waldo and Fudd he discovered it empty, the fire long since faded. Across the
entrance hall laid an open door from which he could hear faint shuffling coming from, and as he
entered the passageway, voices began to reach his ears, voices that sounded very familiar. When
he appeared at the door he saw a figure with it’s back to him hunched over a large thick wooden
table. Harry slipped the chest onto a bench top beside him.
‘Harry!’ he was suddenly swamped by an anxious looking Hermione. She threw her arms around
him, breathing heavily. Harry had grown used to her displays of affection, and he wrapped his arms
around her and hugged her warmly. It felt good to hold her; he had spent last night feeling very
alone and having Hermione here made him feel less empty. He smiled down at her as she pulled
away.
‘When we heard what happened…’ her face was searching his, her mouth struggling breathlessly to
- 19 -
form words ‘… are you alright?’ her face full of concern.
‘I’m fine Hermione ... really,’ He said but she was still holding onto his arms ‘really!’ he nodded in
reassurance.
‘And Hagrid? Is he okay?’ she said urgently
‘He’s fine too, don’t worry’ he said as he plucked her hands off him.
‘I’m glad to hear it.’
Harry looked over Hermione’s shoulder; Lupin had turned around and was looking at him from the
table. He looked grey and sickly ‘Lupin,’ Harry said guiltily. ‘I-I’m sorry,’ he began but Lupin held his
hand up and shook his head softly.
‘Don’t.’ he said gravely ‘I know why you came Harry.’ Hermione took Harry by the arm and led him
to the table opposite Lupin. Harry looked around with a wry smile. His ever-present guard had
caught up with him again.
Sturgis Podmore and Hestia Jones were standing by the window, deep in a whispered conversation,
frequently sending glances in Harry’s direction, and Elphias Doge was standing at the old fashioned
stove giving Sooty instructions on how best to cook scrambled eggs. ‘Fold!’ he wheezed ‘See? Don’t
stir!’
‘What are you doing here? How did you know?’ Harry asked as he sat down.
‘Emerick sent us a message, told us you were here.’ Lupin said studying Harry ‘He knew we’d be
looking for you once word of the Dementors got out.’ His voice changed ‘What he didn’t know is that
we had already been looking for you since mid-day yesterday.’ His face was very stern. Harry
sighed and closed his eyes briefly as Lupin continued. ‘If it wasn’t for Moody dropping in to deliver
Tonks a message, we probably wouldn’t have discovered you gone until it was time for you to check
in,’ he was frowning and looked like he was daring Harry to retort ‘But I’m sure you already know
that, in fact, you were counting on it if I’m not mistaken.’
‘I knew you wouldn’t let me come here otherwise,’ said Harry, suppressing his rising anger. He was
fed up with being treated like a child; tired of having everyone else around him thinking they knew
what was best for him.
‘Have some breakfast, Harry.’ Hermione butted in pushing a plate of eggs under his nose, doing her
best to avoid a confrontation between them.
‘Well you are right about that at least.’ Lupin carried on, ignoring the interruption ‘I would most
definitely have not allowed you to come!’ his frown deepened ‘Look what almost happened! What
you did-' but before he could finish his sentence Harry let loose.
‘I would have thought out of everyone, you’d understand!’ Harry said furiously ‘you were one of my
mum and dads best friends! You would have done the same thing if you were me ... and don’t tell
me my mum and dad would have expected any different either, because I’m too much like them to
think they wouldn’t have understood!'
Lupin had a strange expression on his face, like he was looking at Harry for the first time ‘You are
like them Harry, very much indeed, which is one of the reasons I’m here now.’ His frown had faded
and his voice was tinged with sadness.
Harry sighed heavily and looked down at the table ‘I know.’
‘Harry, we all have to look out for each other ... for you especially, but you must understand,’ He
paused as a tense Hermione put a plate down in front of him ‘you are Voldemorts number one
target. He will stop at nothing to get to you.’ He met Harry’s eyes ‘I am not Dumbledore, I can not
protect you like he could.’ He shook his head gently ‘None of us can.’
Harry looked directly at Lupin ‘I’m not afraid anymore.’ Something in the way he said it made Lupin
smile slightly.
- 20 -
‘I’ve never doubted your courage Harry.’
Elphias let out a frustrated grunt as Sooty "folded" the scrambled eggs all the way over the edge of
the pan and onto the hot metal surface.
‘I said fold not shovel!’ Hermione immediately went into a flutter to rescue Sooty, reassuring her
repeatedly that it was okay and that they had plenty more eggs to go round. Harry noticed Sooty
was regarding Hermione with great caution, as you might an escaped patient from the psychiatric
ward, but Hermione seemed not to notice being too busy shooting scowls at Elphias.
Emerick entered the room not long after and gave Harry a smile and a nod as he settled next to
Lupin and chatted in between mouthfuls. Hagrid came down a little while later and was back to his
usual self, although he seemed very reluctant to catch Lupins attention and even went so far as to
sit himself at the farthest end of the table away from Harry and Lupin with his mound of eggs and
toast. Everyone had emerged by early morning and there was much chatter around the table. It
seemed Waldo and Fudd rarely left the Hollow much anymore and they were using a kitchen full of
wizards to catch up on the latest happenings.
Harry caught snippets of conversation here and there, and he strained particularly hard to hear
what Lupin and Emerick were discussing, but they were difficult to hear over Hermiones repeated
attempts to quiz him. At one point he snapped at her a little impatiently when he thought he had
heard Lupin say Tom Riddles name but she had looked so offended that he gave up trying to eaves
drop and turned his attention to her.
He gently put his hand on hers ‘Sorry,’ he said ‘I didn’t sleep much last night.’
She smiled dully at him ‘No, I don’t suppose you did.’
~*~*~*~
When Harry saw The Burrow his heart lifted; it was like slipping on a pair of comfortable old shoes.
Mrs. Weasley had launched herself at him before he had even got in the door, all in a dither; they
had all been up most of the night waiting for news.
Looking around at their tired faces he started to feel very guilty. Fleur was still her radiant self, she
was the only one who seemed to suffer no consequences at all from lack of sleep, ‘Arry, it eez so
good to see you.’ She drawled as she kissed his cheeks, Harry’s eyes took on a glazed look ‘we have
been worried seek about you! I waz beginning to theenk you would not make it to zee wedding. You
are very naughty to do zat to us.’ She pouted, waving a finger at him as she sat back down at the
kitchen table.
‘Eh, mate!’ Ron slapped him on the shoulder, a large grin plastered across his face. ‘It’s good to
have you back.’ Harry revelled in the welcome he received; it felt good to be back in Ron’s company
again though he found his eyes flitting around the room searchingly.
‘Have you had breakfast Harry?’ Mrs. Weasley was already at the stove, fry pans and plates flying
everywhere.
‘Yeah, thanks,’ he said
‘Gotta hand it to you,’ Ron said ‘you really know how to get up The Orders nose!’ he was wearing a
wry smile as he directed Harry to the foot of the stairs. ‘What’s that?’ he asked motioning to the
small black chest Harry was carrying.
‘Breakfast will be on the table in a minute, Ron’ called Mrs. Weasley ‘So what ever you’ve got to talk
about it can wait!’ Hermione smiled sheepishly at them and all three of them turned to head back to
the table. ‘Not you!’ she gave Harry an authoritative look ‘You can go on up to Fred and Georges
room and get into bed!’ Harry went to argue; all he wanted was to be near Ron and Hermione and
he doubted he would be able to sleep anyway ‘Uh-uh’ she said sternly ‘up you go!'
‘Well I’ve had breakfast too so I’ll-‘
‘Oh no you wont.’ Mrs. Weasley cut Hermione off ‘You can stay here with the rest of us, Harry needs
- 21 -
his sleep!’
‘But none of us have slept!’ said Ron indignantly. She glared at him
‘that’s not the point. Harry, bed! You two, sit!’
Harry left Ron and Hermione’s bewildered looks behind him as he wound his way up the stairs to
Fred and Georges room, placing the chest on a large wooden tallboy near the door. His trunk was
sitting at the end of the bed so he walked over to it and stashed his father’s old cloak away.
Just before apparating back to The Burrow, Hagrid had handed Harry the silvery parcel having
picked it up after Harry had dropped it, and stowed it in one of his many coat pockets. Harry had
forgotten all about it until that moment and was glad Hagrid had thought to retrieve it. He knew he
was going to need it again more than likely, especially if faced with a situation like at the Dursleys
where he needed to slip away.
It seemed as soon as Lupin had found out that Harry was missing from Privet Drive, he had
pounded on the Dursleys door with Moody in his wake to find out how long he’d been gone. This
was pointless of course as the Dursley’s didn’t even know that he was missing and were in such a
state over being harassed by two rather scary looking magical madmen that Lupin had not been
able to get even two coherent words out of them. In the end he had given up trying and had
transported Harry’s trunk directly to The Burrow before he and Moody had left, leaving three very
stunned and frightened people behind.
Lupin pulled Harry aside at Emericks and told him he was to stay at The Burrow until further notice,
he said they had spent a great deal of time trying to ensure it was safe for him there and would be
bitterly disappointed if Harry chose to disregard that fact and scarper off again leaving no clue as to
where he was.
Harry was all too aware he had no place to go anyway, at this point he had no idea where to start
looking for the remaining Horcruxes so it hadn’t been too difficult to set Lupins mind at rest. Hagrid
was to take the bike back to Hogwarts while Lupin and the others escorted Harry here. They had
seemed in a great hurry to leave once they had seen Harry safely to the garden path, stopping only
to give the briefest of waves to Mrs. Weasley as she flung the front door open.
Harry sat on the side of his bed unbuttoning his shirt, staring thoughtfully at the floor, wondering
why they had been in such a hurry. He was getting rather impatient with the fact that The Order
still felt it fitting not to tell him what was going on. He would be seventeen in a couple of weeks and
then he would tell Lupin he wanted in on it all or else! Surely he couldn’t deny Harry once he came
of age and for him, it couldn’t happen soon enough.
Harry suddenly became aware of someone watching him. He looked up sharply and there, leaning
against the doorway, arms crossed over her chest and eyes full of doubt, was Ginny. He stopped
unbuttoning abruptly. He felt a surge in the pit of his stomach as he looked at her; it had been her
he was looking for when his eyes had strayed around the room downstairs, and seeing her now he
wondered how he had ever found the strength to leave her.
‘Hi,’ her voice sounded like nectar.
‘Hi,’ he answered. Stop it! He thought as he tried to reign in the emotions that flared uncontrollably
within him.
‘Just wanted to see that you… that you were okay.’ She frowned slightly
‘I’m fine,’ his answer was stunted, not wanting his voice to betray him. Ginny nodded slightly then
without another word, turned and left. Harry pulled his glasses off and collapsed back on the bed
rubbing his face with his hands, his eyes closed. What are you doing? Get a grip! He thought to
himself. It’s not that hard, just deal with it!
He breathed heavily, pulled himself back up, walked to the door and closed it.
Out of the blackness came an eerie apparition, it was Dumbledore holding his arm out before him in
offering, Sirius was struggling behind him, his face contorted with effort, his hands gripping the
mouth of a doorway, his body stretched out behind him as he was being sucked in. Harry reached
out desperately but was slowed by an unseen force; he was fighting against the air as if he were
embedded in sand. Then Snape stood before them, the same ugly expression on his face as when
he had struck down Dumbledore. He had both arms raised above his head grasping a shining
- 22 -
object, and then suddenly Sirius roared ‘Harry!’
Harry jumped up onto his elbow, his breathing ragged and his heartbeat racing, dripping in sweat.
Snape's face still burned in his mind, a lingering residue of the dream he’d been having.
What time was it? He looked over at the window; the sun was streaming through the gaps in the
curtains. Harry pulled himself up and swung his feet on the floor. He sat there with his head hung
low running his hands through his unkempt hair for a moment, then he shook his head and stood
up, grabbed his clothes and headed for the bathroom.
~*~*~*~
The trio had spent the following days leading up to the wedding exchanging what little information
they had. Harry had told Ron and Hermione of Sooty and her revelations about his mother, both of
them had eyed Harry with a mixture of shock and awe, and though she tried to hide it, Harry was
sure he caught a glimmer of excitement in Hermione’s eyes.
Ginny interrupted just then on Mrs. Weasley's orders to call them in for dinner. Since their first
encounter he had not seen very much of her; somehow she was never in the room with him unless
the whole family was present, and she seemed to spend a lot of time with Fleur, helping with last
minute wedding arrangements. To Harry's surprise, Bill had asked him if he would be a groomsman,
saying that the twins were going to busy doing other things and Charlie wouldn't be able to make it.
Percy's name was never raised.
While Harry was at the Dursleys, Ron had spent many long hours hovering in gloomy hallways
outside open doors trying to catch snippets of conversation between his father and Bill, sometimes
even resorting to using a pair of Fred and Georges extendable ears.
It had become apparent the Dementors were now a formidable force; Harry had been told last year
they were breeding and going by how many had turned up in Godric’s Hollow there was a
frightening number at large. Their random attacks had become organized ambushes where people
from all over the wizarding community were targeted.
The Death Eaters had even lay siege to a number of older, well respected family homes and it was
said that none were ever left behind, all were either killed or missing.
St Mungos had called in all able healers in the community they could find as their wards swelled
with casualties, Mrs. Weasley, who had some skill with more minor ailments had taken to
volunteering there several times a week though she had said she wasn’t able to do much except
reassure people. Ron had heard her sobbing one night to his father because she was finding it
difficult to cope with the grief of relatives.
There was a report someone from the ministry claimed to have sited Ollivander, the wand maker
previously thought missing, hovering in the shadows of the abandoned shops in Hogsmeade one
evening, however when they had done a double take he was gone.
The information went on and on, all of it was pretty much as Harry had expected, but what he really
wanted to know was Voldemorts plan of attack, and what The Order were doing to counter it. He
was feeling incredibly frustrated as he sat in the Weasleys back yard, turning the small golden
locket from the cave over and over in his hand. Hermione was leaning against Ron’s shoulder
stifling a yawn as he unconsciously put an arm round to support her, all three of them were
exhausted having spent the last few nights meeting in Harry’s room once the house fell quiet, trying
desperately to work out where to start with the Horcruxes.
As yet Hermione’s attempts at trying to figure out who or what R.A.B. stood for had been
unsuccessful and she complained bitterly at not having access the Hogwarts library for information.
They debated long and hard as to their first course of action. In the end Ron and Hermione agreed
to return to Hogwarts without Harry if their letters came, it was as good a base as any and
Hermione would finally have access to the extensive library, plus they would keep on studying and
maybe pick up some new hexes and spells that would come in handy.
- 23 -
As Harry was unable to do so last time, he decided would return to Godric’s Hollow to visit his
mother and fathers graves. Hermione had been particularly disturbed by this but Harry had agreed
to talk to Lupin about going with him, he would be seventeen and free to do as he saw fit by then so
Lupin would have to agree if he wanted to keep Harry under guard.
‘What’s for dinner?’ Ron asked
‘I don’t know. Your mums too busy with Fleur at the moment, she’s going off for the night soon and
wont be back until the ceremony tomorrow.’ Answered Hermione ‘your dad’s taking her to the
Diggory’s; they were really keen to help apparently. I think they’re glad to have something to look
forward to for a change.’ Ron brushed her hair back as she said ‘Ginny and I are going first thing in
the morning when Fleur's family arrive.’
‘I think we should all get a good nights sleep tonight.’ said Harry
‘I agree’ Hermione sighed ‘Tomorrow’s going to be our last carefree day for a long time so we might
as well make the most of it.’
Harry woke next morning to a house in uproar. Fred and George came charging into the room and
yanked the curtains open.
‘Hiya Harry!’ Fred had plonked himself on the edge of the bed, and slapped Harry on the shoulder
before he’d had a chance to pull on his glasses. George was busy rummaging in one of the many
boxes piled around the room.
‘C’mon Sleeping Beauty!’ he said over his shoulder ‘Not everyday you get to see a full blown wizard
wedding!’
‘We’re in charge of the decorations … knew mum’d come round in the end’ Fred winked at Harry
‘Don’t know what she’s so worried about.’
‘It’s going to be the usual thing … with our own special touch of course.’ George tossed a box to the
door and opened another.
‘You’re in for a real treat, even if we do say so ourselves.’ Fred grinned
‘What’s a wizard wedding?’ Harry was still trying to shake off sleep.
‘Wouldn’t want to spoil the surprise.’ said Fred
‘What’s goin on?’ Ron appeared at the doorway in his pyjamas, his hair sticking out in all directions.
‘Ahh… our dear brother!’ said George. He suddenly stopped what he was doing and looked from Ron
to Harry and back to Ron ‘Are you two having some sort of worst bed-hair contest or something?’
‘Wha..?’ said Ron scratching his head lazily.
‘Well Ron is our clear winner this morning! Congratulations!’ quipped Fred as he threw him a small
golden wrapped sweet from his pocket ‘and you did it without even trying!’
‘That’s our Ron! A natural at all the important things.’ George said as he dragged another box to the
door.
Hermione, Mrs. Weasley and Ginny had left already and once Harry and Ron had rushed through
breakfast the four of them went outside to where Mr. Weasley, Dedalus Diggle, Lupin and Tonks
were standing. They were surveying the area in front of them.
‘We’ll put it there; it’s got some shade. It’s going to be hot today and there’s quite a few older and
younger people coming.’ Said Mr. Weasley
‘Oh yes!’ said Dedalus, bouncing excitedly on the balls of his feet ‘Lovely spot right there. I’ll get the
others!’ and he darted of with amazing speed for a wizard of his age.
‘Wotcher Harry, Ron’ Tonks hair was a long curly mauve colour and she looked much happier than
she had last time he’d seen her. Lupin had his hand in the small of her back.
‘Hello!’ he said with a smile, Harry was surprised to see how well Lupin looked and a slight pang of
guilt hit him as he reminded himself why he had looked ill last time.
‘Hello boys!’ said Mr. Weasley ‘Got a job for you and Harry, Ron’
- 24 -
‘Right! We’ll be off then.’ Said George as Fred floated the boxes across the lawn.
‘Now … Fred ... George, I don’t want anything too over the top, right?’ Mr. Weasley was eyeing
them warily.
‘Muah?’ said Fred innocently
‘Father … really!’ chimed in George.
‘Height of sophistication and understatement, that’s us!’ said George.
‘Absolutely!’ exclaimed Fred grinning ‘don’t worry about a thing, just leave it in our capable hands.’
Mr. Weasley watched them go out of the corner of his eye, doubt written all over his face. Harry and
Ron exchanged grins as Mr. Weasley led them back inside.
Mr. Weasley had set them to the most monotonous task of all; tying little bundles of an assortment
of Honeydukes sweets together; they rewarded themselves regularly for their punishing job with
exploding bonbons and Fizzing Wizzbees. They had almost finished when Mr. Weasley appeared at
the foot of the stairs looking very smart in his dress robes.
‘Alright?’
‘Yeah, almost done.’ Said Harry
‘Cud ff guv’n oos u berrer yob!’ said Ron frowning through a mouthful of fudge.
‘You’d better go on up and get ready as soon as your done. People will be arriving soon. Don’t want
the Groomsmen to be late!’ He grinned; clapping his hands together he stalked out the back door.
When Harry and Ron finally emerged in their dress robes, people had already started arriving, Harry
spotted Order members spread throughout the grounds all dressed up but looking very much on
duty.
As he wondered round the grounds he looked about him amazed at the transformation. White
flowers had been magicked onto every plant, bush and tree to form a spectacular curtain backdrop,
and a golden silk carpet had been laid out to form a path through the middle of the white chairs that
circled around a golden mesh dome raised off the ground on six thin golden pillars.
The dome was also dotted with white flowers and beneath it laid a small white platform where Harry
presumed they would be standing. The shaded area outside the circle was packed with large white
circular tables and on the centre of each stood a magnificent statue of a golden bird, wings half
open and head held high as if about to launch into flight. The area was semi enclosed by burning
torches on golden stilts.
As Harry moved through the crowd he could feel curious eyes on him and could hear quiet whispers
as he passed. But today he did not care; today he would enjoy the celebrations and not worry about
tomorrow.
There were many people he didn’t know and some he did. To his pleasant surprise he noticed Luna
waving at them, so he and Ron moseyed over.
‘Hi Harry, Ron.’ She had a broad dreamy smile on her face ‘Nice day for it, don’t you think?’
‘Lovely!’ said Ron ‘I didn’t know you were coming.’
‘Oh yes. We live not far from here, just over yonder’ she motioned her head ‘I must say, I have
been wondering how Bill is doing, have there been any side effects?’
This was typical of Luna Lovegood; she had an incredible bluntness about her, often to the slight
embarrassment of others. Harry smiled.
‘Not yet Luna,’
‘My father says he would have a good sense of smell now at least.’
Ron and Harry both laughed through their noses. ‘Maybe, haven’t noticed it though.’ Said Ron,
composing himself.
‘Probably has acute hearing too, don’t you know.’ Added Luna matter of factly, seemingly unaware
her comments were amusing. Ron’s hand went up to his mouth to stifle his laughter.
‘Could be.’ Said Harry with a big grin on his face, ‘So are you going back to Hogwarts if you get a
letter?’
‘Oh yes, absolutely. I cant imagine what else I would be doing otherwise.’
- 25 -
Neville came up behind her ‘Hi Harry!’
‘Hey Neville’ Harry said ‘What about you, are you going back to Hogwarts?’
‘Yeah … Gran wants me to go … but I’d go anyway.’ He looked at them nervously ‘You’re going
aren’t you?’
‘I am, and Hermione.’ Said Ron ‘Luna says she’ll be going back too. I imagine Ginny will be as well.’
‘Oh, good!’ he said with some relief ‘What about you Harry?’
‘No … I don’t think so.’ Harry looked at his feet, Neville was bound to start asking questions and
Harry didn’t want to lie to him. He was saved by Kingsley Shacklebolt's deep resonant voice as held
his wand to his throat.
‘Welcome on behalf of the Delacours and the Weasleys! If you would please take a seat we can
begin.’
‘We’d better get into place’ Ron tapped Harry on the shoulder and they headed for the dome where
Bill was already standing. Whether it was the light, or the fact that Bill had never looked so happy,
it was impossible to tell, but his scarring seemed almost non-existent as he stood smiling nervously.
After everyone was settled and all was quiet, a small melodic song started to drift through the air. It
was hauntingly beautiful and Harry found himself looking for the source of it. He couldn’t see
anything but everyone else was looking towards the platform. He looked up … the song was
radiating from the golden mesh dome as it glinted in the afternoon sun. It was a phoenix song.
Then Harry understood.
This whole wedding was a dedication to Dumbledore. The golden mesh dome was like that which
had sung to him in the graveyard years before. And the golden statues were phoenixes. Bill and
Fleur must have changed the arrangements shortly after Dumbledores death. Harry felt a dull ache
in his stomach.
People started turning their heads, looking up the golden carpet expectantly. Soft ‘oohs' and 'ahhs’
crept through the crowd as Harry’s mouth gaped slightly, the ache in his stomach rising as his
heartbeat quickened.
Fleur was coming down the carpet adorned in layers of white chiffon with gold silken overlays
hanging in gentle peaks, her hair was up in an elaborate knot and the tiara Mrs. Weasley had
offered her in the hospital ward at Hogwarts sparkled in the light. Everyone was staring at her
entranced. Everyone that is, except Harry.
A little way behind Hermione came Ginny. She was also adorned in white chiffon that flowed so
softly around her, it gave the appearance she was floating. Her hair was up in a knot and soft
strands escaped and wisped around her face. Harry had never seen Ginny like this before, only once
had he seen her dressed up and that was three years ago when they had both seemed so much
younger. His eyes followed her all the way down the carpet and it wasn’t until Ron gave him a
nudge that he came to and thought to close his mouth. He stared at Ginny’s slender neck, straying
to the gentle line of her full lips, and as she came to a halt, he found himself waiting for her to look
up at him, longing for her to acknowledge him, but her eyes stared directly ahead or at her feet.
The ceremony was quite quick and a shower of bright white sparks fell from around the edge of the
dome to indicate the end. People applauded loudly and Bill and Fleur kissed before leaving the
dome, Harry fell in behind them, Ginny at his side. He was acutely aware of her presence and he
thought he might go mad if he had to stand with her much longer, so close, and yet unable to touch
her. Thankfully the crowd followed and the bridal party dispersed to the lawn area.
Fred and George put on a display like nothing he had ever seen before. There were fireworks in the
shape of white doves that flew into the air and showers of white flower petals burst from gold balls
they sent into the sky. Everywhere people were laughing and clapping, but the ache in Harry’s
stomach did not abate.
The chairs flew to the tables as a couple of wizards flicked their wands and everyone sat down to
eat. To Harry’s dismay he was seated next to Ginny on the bridal table. She engaged herself in
conversation at once with a young wizard who was a family friend of the Delacours, so Harry spoke
- 26 -
to Hermione and Ron who were seated next to him. Hermione looked almost as beautiful as Fleur,
and it was apparent that Ron thought so too as he held Hermiones hand in his under the table,
stroking it gently. Harry’s chest pounded as he thought of all that he was giving up.
After the sumptuous meal which Harry barely touched, people started moving off to dance and chat
with others. Ginny had left as soon as she finished eating, and Harry noted with disappointment
that she had cleaned her plate. Obviously she wasn’t having as hard a time as he was.
As the afternoon turned to dusk Fred and George put on another brilliant display of multicoloured
fireworks that culminated in a big golden cylinder exploding over their heads that spelled out a
rather mischievous comment about the impending wedding night, before showering the giggling
crowd with golden glitter.
Harry felt completely drained and decided to try and slip away unnoticed. He entered the house and
crept up the stairs quietly, not wanting to get trapped by someone. As he passed the bathroom
something caught his attention and he paused. It sounded like someone was crying beyond the
closed door.
He put his head to the wood and rapped lightly with his knuckles, ‘Hello?’ It went immediately
silent.
‘Are you alright?’ Still nothing. He rapped again ‘Hello?’ Only silence.
He headed away from the door, climbing a little higher then stopped on the shadowed landing. A
moment or two passed, and then the door clicked open. Light streamed out onto the landing and a
figure emerged, closing the door behind them and heading down the stairs.
‘Ginny!’ Harry ran as fast as he could to catch her. Grabbing her elbow he spun her around on the
step. Her eyes were red and swollen and her cheeks flushed. He brought himself level with her
‘Ginny,’ he said softly, taking in her pained expression. Before he could think about what he was
doing he kissed her. She melted into him with a soft groan and he could feel her pain as she kissed
him back.
Harry didn’t know how long they stayed there like that, but something made him pull away. Drifting
up the stairwell from outside were faint cries growing in the darkness. Suddenly, a series of loud
bangs and crashes rang out in the distance followed by yelling from desperate voices.
‘Stay here!’ Harry breathed and bolted down the stairs three at a time towards the terrified
screams.
4. Harry's Curse and Lupin's Promise
Harry’s heartbeat raced as he whipped out his wand and pushed through the backdoor. A wizard
was stumbling towards him as he leapt down the stone steps.
Harry grabbed the front of his robes and yanked him to his feet. ‘What’s happening?’ he asked
urgently, but the wizard looked too terrified to speak. Harry released him angrily, running on as
flashes of light in the night sky ahead of him were going in every direction. People were rushing
passed him away from the noise, screaming women pulling their weeping children behind them.
There was a tremendous crash as Harry dived out into the open, taking in the scene before him.
Tables were upturned and broken and chairs littered the lawn. Several bushes that had been hit by
stray curses were ablaze and the wreckage of the dome that had just collapsed smouldered in a
heap on the ground. Order members were joined by other witches and wizards scattered around the
grounds, wands drawn, darting around as they struggled against the many black hooded figures
encircling them.
Death Eaters!
Harry bolted towards Neville who was back to back with Luna. Both of them had their wands drawn,
pointing them at the four cloaked figures that were closing in around them.
- 27 -
‘Expelliarmus!’ cried Harry and a wand flew through the air. Two of the Death Eaters turned in
surprise while the other dove after his wand.
‘Impedimenta!’ Neville caught the back of one of the Death Eaters facing Harry. Their body
stiffened.
Harry leapt sideways to avoid a curse ‘Stupefy!’ A red flash from Harry’s wand hit the other Death
Eater, knocking them off their feet.
Luna was going toe to toe with her assailant and had hit him with a Tarantallegra curse as Neville
turned to the Death Eater who was now brandishing his wand again.
‘George!’ Harry spun round just in time to see Fred throw black powder into the air, then suddenly
disappear in darkness along with three Death Eaters. George raced in after him.
Harry searched the area in front of him, everywhere there were mini battles being fought. He
spotted Hermione dodging back and forth behind a tree, staving off curses as they flew at her; Ron
was rushing towards her firing as he went. He jumped over a fallen Death Eater he had downed and
was yelling ‘Over Here!’ at the two holding Hermione at bay.
Bill had taken on three Death Eaters at once, he had a wild look in his eyes and was dodging their
curses with incredible speed, jumping around even leaping into the air in a back flip to escape jets
of light as they soared at him. Harry looked away just as Bill's foot connected powerfully with one of
them, launching them backwards.
There was an enormous struggle going on in the ruin of the tables so Harry raced into the fray. His
curses flew thick and fast as he weaved in and out the wreckage, hitting two Death Eaters almost
immediately before they became aware he was behind them. ‘Harry, look out!’ the instant he heard
Mr. Weasleys voice he dove behind an upturned table. A white light flashed over his head, barely
missing him. He scurried out from behind the table ‘Stupefy!’ another Death Eater crumbled as the
jet of red light from Harry’s wand made contact. All around him Death Eaters were dropping, so he
headed back over to Neville and Luna.
They were dodging curses being thrown wildly about by a Death Eater who was laughing maniacally.
He quickened his pace as his blood boiled, and when he neared, he raised his wand, but before he
could fire off a curse his target suddenly dropped to the ground for no apparent reason.
Harry ran up to the body, lifting it slightly with his foot, it rolled limply. He looked about him and
saw two more Death Eaters drop one after the other in mid duel without any obvious cause, but a
few others were fighting on, now highly out numbered. His eyes fell on Ginny, her hair was strewn
across her face and her dress was covered in grass stains, she fought alongside Ron and Hermione
as they downed another Death Eater. He smiled inwardly; he had known she would come, she had
probably been right behind him.
With the last Death Eater on the ground, people were starting to file back onto the lawn slowly,
looking for family and friends they had been separated from. By some sort of miracle it seemed all
of the fallen were Death Eaters, though many of their side displayed signs of the tussle. Lupin and
the others were going around the unconscious and cursed, disarming them and placing binds
around their bodies.
Then suddenly, Harry was yanked backwards.
‘What?’ he looked around but stood his ground. A young witch he didn’t know had him by the arm
and was trying to drag him towards the house.
‘Please! … Please help!’ Her eyes were wide with fear and swollen with tears. ‘Please… you have to
come … she needs you!’
Harry frowned ‘who? ... where?’ he hurried off with the young girl; once again going in the opposite
direction to everyone else ‘Where are we going?’ They didn’t go into the house as Harry had
expected, instead she led him round to the front. The young witch then let go of Harry’s arm as
they entered the yard and stood wide-eyed, looking terrified.
Harry's eyes wandered around the deserted yard, wondering what he was looking for ‘Where are
- 28 -
you?’ he yelled.
The old wooden gate at the end of the long pathway squeaked as it hung loosely off its hinges, it
was gaping open to reveal a young girl with silky blonde hair illuminated by the torchlight.
Gabrielle? Fleur’s younger sister, who idolized Harry, was staring at him, motionless, eyes full of
horror and tears streaming down her pale face.
‘What is it? … What’s wrong?’ He walked slowly towards her, his wand hanging at his side. As he
made his way up the path a feeling of dread took hold of him. He broke into a run but pulled up
suddenly, stunned. A figure was coming into view behind her as it pulled off a silvery cloak.
Bellatrix was standing with a malicious smile twisted across her face and her wand tip at Gabrielle’s
temple.
The young witch behind Harry whimpered and he felt his stomach drop as panic began to rise in
him. The world seemed to stop. Nothing existed outside the three of them. He raised his wand,
pointing it at Bellatrix’s head.
‘Don’t’ he said quietly.
Laughter trickled out of her cruel mouth, her eyes gleaming in the light. ‘You are so predictable,
Potter.’ She looked amused, shaking her head slightly ‘Always the hero. But you never stop to
think!’ He looked down into Gabrielle’s frightened eyes. A wave of nausea surged through him
painfully. She was staring at him through watery wide-eyes as tears spilled down her cheek, too
terrified to move or speak. Silently pleading. His wand arm began to tremble.
‘Don’t do it.’ His voice came out low and unsteady. Bellatrix glanced down at the girl in front of her.
‘You’re really not doing them any favours.' she taunted. 'Its because she loved you, you know ...
that's why she's going to die.’
Harry felt like his chest was caving in on him. Sounding more like a plea as his eyes stung with hot
tears, he urged ‘don’t … don't do it!’ hardly able to breathe.
‘Aw, poor little puppy!' she mocked in a babyish voice. 'You knew this would happen. You've got
nobody to blame but yourself.' She said it as if he were child. 'You knew you would get somebody
killed!’ Her wand hand tilted slightly.
‘NO!’ Two loud cracks rang out. Gabrielle went limp as a red flash soared over her into the
darkness. Bellatrix was gone, and Gabrielle crumpled to the ground.
It was as if Harry had sunk into a dream ... a nightmare he could not wake from. Nothing felt real
as the world faded around him. He went to Gabrielle, slowing as he neared her, dreading what he
would find. ‘No’ escaped his lips as he struggled to breathe. She was lying at an awkward angle on
her back, her head lolled to one side. He knelt down hesitantly, and cupped her small face in his
hand. As he turned her gently to him he saw the scorched area on her temple where the wand had
touched it. ‘No’ He was sinking rapidly ... sinking into the very earth with the weight of it.
There were muffled sounds coming from behind him but they seemed to him to be a great distance
away as he stared at the lifeless face in his hands. ‘… Harry… Harry!’ Lupins voice was swimming
around his head and he was vaguely aware of another figure on the ground opposite him.
‘Gabrielle!’ It peeled his hand off the expressionless face. Then there were more shapes and more
voices. ‘Harry … Harry!' He felt himself being drawn up by the arm, still staring at the sleeping face,
unable to look away '... take him ... Get him out of here!' A faraway voice spoke. Harry dragged his
eyes from her as he was pulled away. He felt sick and wanted to throw up ... ‘Get him up to his
room!’ It sounded like Mrs. Weasley but she was only faint, there was a loud wailing somewhere far
off ... ‘Open the door!’ Hermiones voice came from the distance ... ‘This way, mate’ Harry felt Ron’s
hand on his shoulder as he mounted the stairs. When they reached the bathroom he broke away
and flung himself over the toilet. He could hear Hermione’s sobs behind him as he spluttered and
vomited and retched until his whole body ached.
Then somehow he was in his room, sitting on the bed flanked by Hermione and Ron. He was
- 29 -
weakened and shaking uncontrollably. ‘I killed her...’ He said in a voice that didn’t seem to belong
to him. Hermione whimpered softly as he stared at the floor, Gabrielle’s lifeless face burned into his
mind. ‘It was my fault…’
‘No ... no Harry… don’t say that!’ Hermiones voice was raw with emotion.
‘It wasn’t your fault mate …’ Ron’s calming voice echoed in his ear ‘it was a trap …’ his hand was on
the back of Harry’s shoulder
'It was because of me...' that strange voice again 'she's dead ... because of me...'
‘Harry … you couldn’t have done anything … it wasn't you...’ Hermione put her arm on his back
‘I knew this would happen … I knew …’
‘It was a trap … they weren’t Death Eaters we were fighting in the backyard Harry … it wasn’t your
fault … they set you up’ Ron’s voice was quiet.
Harry lifted his head slowly and looked at Ron ‘what are you ... talking ...?’
‘Those people out there are not Death Eaters. They were just witches and wizards … must have
been under the imperious curse.’
‘What?’ Harry felt lost, alone ... and angry, so very angry.
‘That’s why we were able to defeat them so easily.’ Hermione said as he turned to her ‘they weren’t
Death Eaters Harry. It was a trap … they were setting you up.’ Her eyes were red and swollen.
Harry felt the hatred swell in him ‘Why? ... So I could watch them murder an innocent young girl?’
his voice was laced with loathing as his eyes prickled with angry tears.
‘I-I don’t know wh-why…’ fresh tears spilled down her cheeks. Harry hung his head unable to think
straight. Staring at the floor he rubbed his hand over his messy hair, he was shaking as the anger
coursed through his body.
A figure emerged through the doorway and Harry knew who it was without looking up. ‘Get out.’ He
said quietly not raising his head. There was a sharp intake of breath and he knew he had struck her
deeply. He closed his eyes painfully ‘GO!’
In a flurry of chiffon she was gone. Hermione leapt off the bed sobbing and chased after Ginny.
‘C’mon mate,' Ron said hoarsely. 'I think you should lay down for a bit.’
Harry stayed where he was. He did not move. He would not sleep. His body ached and his mind was
numb and he had never felt as angry or as sad, or as guilty in his entire life.
~*~*~*~
Harry stared out of the bedroom window. The morning’s rays shone harshly down on the scene
before him. Everyone had long gone, the fake Death Eaters had been taken to St Mungos under
guard and all that was left of the nights events were a few burn patches and some shrapnel strewn
across the lawn. Several Order members and aurors from the ministry were planted around the
grounds.
The ministry’s aurors had been conspicuously absent until now, probably because Harry had not
agreed to Scrimgeour’s request to be the "face" of the ministry. As Harry unconsciously counted
them he saw Moody emerge from the side of the house, looking up at his window. He should’ve
known Lupin would put Moody on him. Harry felt a stab of anger; Lupin would know what he was
thinking.
Realizing it was pointless trying to leave, he turned away from the window and sat on the bed.
Gabrielle’s lifeless face haunted him. He pulled off his glasses and rubbed his eyes in an effort to
push the image from his mind. He was in no doubt what he had to do. One thought had overtaken
- 30 -
him from the moment Ron had left the room. He had to leave. He endangered everyone around
him; everyone he cared about. Voldemort would kill all of them, one by one, to get to him.
Harry could hear movement somewhere down stairs; Mrs. Weasley would be fixing breakfast for the
guard. She had come to him during the night with a potion for sleep, though she had not tried to
soothe him or hug him, for which Harry was thankful. She had looked at him pityingly and told him
he should sleep, placing the potion by the bed before she left. And there the potion still sat,
untouched. It would not have been right to sleep peacefully, to spend the night as if nothing had
happened. He had seen Gabrielle’s torment and knew she deserved better than that.
There was a small knock at the door. Harry sat silently, not wanting to see anyone, his body was
weary and he felt the lowest he had ever felt. The door creaked open and Harry looked up into
Lupins tired face. He looked away quickly as the anger in him rose. Lupin closed the door behind
him and walked across the room, pulling up a chair. Harry avoided looking at him; he did not want
to hear what Lupin would say. He would tell Harry it wasn’t his fault. He would try to convince Harry
that staying here was best. But Lupin did not know what Harry knew, he did not know about the
Horcruxes, he had not been privy to the memories Dumbledore had shown Harry. He did not know
that Dumbledore had expected Harry to go on alone.
He would not understand.
Lupin sat for a moment in silence, and then finally he spoke. ‘I wont pretend to know what you
must be feeling, Harry.’ Lupin said quietly ‘And I don’t suppose anything I can say, will make you
feel any better.’ He sighed deeply ‘No one should have to go through what you did last night…’
‘It was nothing to what Gabrielle went through.’ Harry said bitterly.
Lupin bowed his head. ‘I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now, but-'
‘Then don’t say it!’ Harry said sharply, looking at the top of Lupins head, his anger brewing inside
him.
Lupin got up and walked over to the window, he stood looking out at the wreckage below. ‘I don’t
know what to do anymore, Harry.’ Looking at him, Harry thought his face appeared pasty in the
early grey light.
‘If anyone is to blame it’s me.’ Lupin did not turn to look at Harry as he spoke sombrely. ‘I was
responsible for the safety of everyone here last night Harry, not you. I should have seen it was a
trap as soon as they attacked. It made no sense for them to wait until there were so many people
around. If Voldemort wanted to kill you he would have tried when there were fewer of us to fight.
‘Instead he sent unwilling servants in under the imperious curse to fight a battle they could not win.
Voldemort would not lose any of his valuable Death Eaters in the process of drawing you out. An
extraordinarily elaborate scheme which must have involved a lot of man power and heavy planning.’
Harry searched the floor in front of him, taking in everything Lupin said ‘I spoke to the young girl
who led you to the front garden. She told how a woman at the wedding had approached her and
Gabrielle, asking whom they were … whether they knew you. She was another one under the
imperious curse of course, except that she was a guest at the wedding. Gabrielle was only too eager
to talk about you.
‘She told the woman how you saved her from the merpeople more than two years ago, and how she
had been very much looking forward to seeing you again at the wedding.’ Harry closed his eyes and
sucked in his pain. ‘I found out later the woman had approached others, but after speaking with
Gabrielle, she had found what she was looking for. When we were attacked, she lured the two
young girls to the front of the house, and then all she had to do was wait until people returned to
the back yard. She told Gabrielle that Harry Potter was hurt, that he was lying on the road in need
of help. Gabrielle rushed out of the gate to find you and that is when a real Death Eater grabbed
her-'
‘It was Bellatrix LeStrange.’ Harry said hatefully.
Lupin lowered his head, and after a moment he continued ‘She sent the other young girl to find you,
she was told to go only to Harry Potter or she would kill Gabrielle.’ Lupin turned to look at Harry
now. He looked sicklier than Harry had ever seen him ‘I made a mistake Harry … a mistake that
cost a young girl her life.’
- 31 -
‘Bellatrix did it. Not you …' Harry swallowed ‘and not me.’ It felt strange to say it, but Harry was
beginning to understand as Lupin recounted the nights events, that there was no way either of them
could have known what would unfold. It didn’t dull his pain, but it helped to clear his head. ‘She did
it … she’s the murderer … and she’s the one who’ll pay for it!’ Harry was seething inside as he
looked up at Lupin ‘I’m going after her.' he said flatly 'She sent Sirius to his death, she put Neville’s
parents in St Mungos and now …’ he looked at his feet ‘now this. She has to be stopped,’ he looked
back at Lupin ‘before she gets the opportunity to destroy someone else’s life.’ Harry was ready for
an argument; his barely suppressed rage would be unleashed upon Lupin any minute.
‘She wont be easy to get to,’ Lupin said as he crossed the floor and sat himself down ‘we’ve being
trying for months. I’ve got a personal score to settle with her myself.’ Harry had not expected this.
‘Harry, I realize that you come of age next week, and I’m fully aware that you have no intentions of
staying here after that.' Lupin held up a hand 'I understand why,’ he rushed on before Harry could
speak ‘and I wont try to stop you, but you should be aware that everything that happened last night
was to push you to make this choice.’ Harry frowned at Lupin as he continued ‘Voldemort knows
what sort of person you are. He has seen the lengths you will go to, to protect others. The trap was
laid with the express purpose of convincing you to go it alone. Why? I can only guess that he feels it
will make it easier for him to get to you. But Harry,’ Lupin held Harry’s gaze ‘you do not need to do
this alone. I will be there every step of the way to help you with this. And if you must face
Voldemort … then I will have your back. That I promise you.’
Harry felt a surge of gratitude to the weary figure before him, though he would have no more
willingly put Lupin in danger than he would have Sirius. But knowing that Lupin felt this way
lightened Harry’s heart a little, and he managed to let go of the anger that was threatening to
consume him. Mrs. Weasley came in and left a tray of toast and pumpkin juice on the cabinet next
to the old black chest. She looked as worn out as Lupin.
‘How’s Fleur’s family?’ Harry asked her quietly. She looked at him as if she were pondering whether
to answer or not. He could see her eyes were unusually watery and he thought that she might burst
into tears; he immediately regretted asking.
‘I don’t think you need worry about anyone else for the moment.’ There was that look of pity again.
‘People get through these things … they always do.’ Her voice was the softest he had ever heard it.
‘I want you to stay in here for today … you need your rest.' Her eye's flickered over the cup that sat
on his cabinet 'And I see you haven’t taken your potion, so you wont have slept.’ A tear spilled
down her cheek and she brushed it away hastily, embarrassed. ‘You can’t go on punishing yourself
for something you had no control over.’ Her voice was decidedly shaky so Harry, fearing she would
start crying, looked down at his feet. Lupin got up and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder ‘Get some
rest,’ then he turned and left with Mrs. Weasley.
Harry looked at the breakfast tray and felt sick all over again, so he threw a t-shirt over the food.
He lay back on the bed, his hands behind his head and thought about what Lupin had said.
Voldemort may have wanted Harry to leave everyone behind, but he was unaware Harry knew his
secret. He didn’t know that Harry’s best chance of destroying him was to be out there alone. Pain
washed through him as he thought of Gabrielle. It sickened him as he thought of Fleur, it had been
her wedding day and he couldn’t have imagined a worse ending.
There was a soft knock and Harry saw Ron’s face peer round the door. ‘You want some company?’
Harry nodded slightly, anything to stave off those terrified eyes that crept into his thoughts. Ron
walked over and sat on the chair Lupin had vacated.
‘Mum said you looked terrible’ he said in agreement ‘I suppose Lupin told you what happened last
night.’ Ron was frowning as if not sure he should be asking about it.
‘Yeah’
Ron nodded and sighed ‘He was wasting his time going to all that effort when you were leaving
anyway.’ Ron spoke quietly as he stared off into space. Harry knew Ron meant well, but he was
beginning to wish he hadn’t told him to come in. ‘Have some toast, mate’ he said as he pulled the t-
shirt off and lifted the tray down. Harry sat up and looked at the dry bread again. If it meant he
didn’t have to talk about last night and still have Ron’s company then he would eat. He couldn’t
bare the thought of putting anything on the toast so he nibbled at the small cardboard like pieces
- 32 -
uninterestedly.
Hermione came in while he was chewing a particularly stubborn piece of toast. It didn’t seem to
want to go down at all so Harry gave up trying to eat anymore. Hermione regarded Harry closely
and went to say something, but then seemed to think the better of it and sat gingerly on his bed
instead. ‘You should try to eat more Harry.’ She was looking at the pathetically nibbled edges of his
toast.
‘I’ve had enough’ he said and put the tray down. ‘So how’s Fleur?’
Hermione’s frown deepened.
‘Mrs. Weasley spent all night with her. Mrs. Delacour was taken to St Mungos, Fleur's dad went with
her, she was in pretty bad shape … she kept saying over and over that her baby was dead, and no
matter what Ron’s mum said, she couldn’t calm her…’ her voice trailed off as she saw the effect of
her answer in Harry’s face.
He could feel the nausea building as he jumped off the bed and flew down to the bathroom, only
just making it in time. There wasn’t much to purge so he spent most of his time dry retching. Ron
was waiting outside the bathroom when he emerged ‘S’okay mate,’ he said sombrely. Harry was
feeling slightly embarrassed and avoided looking Ron in the face, but Ron put his hand on Harry’s
back and followed him up to the room.
Hermione had her face in her hands, she looked up when they came in ‘I’m sorry … that was so
stupid of me,’ Her eyes were leaking fresh tears.
'Don’t worry about it,’ Harry ached from the convulsions so he sat back down on the bed, he was
feeling so weak his body shook.
‘I wish there was something I could do for you, mate, but I don’t think it’s gonna be that easy.’ Ron
looked extremely sober.
‘There is something you can do,’ said Hermione in an unsteady tone ‘get him to drink that.’ She
gestured to the potion on the bedside cabinet.
Ron looked over at the cup and then at Harry ‘How ‘bout it?’ he said quietly
Harry looked at the cup and thought about what it held. Sleep … Peace. He took the cup and placed
it to his lips, looking down at the purple contents. Peace, he thought as he tipped it back and
swallowed it down. He pulled off his glasses and placed them on the cabinet as he lay back on the
pillow and closed his eyes, within seconds he felt the drowsiness of sleep envelope him.
Nothingness.
5. Leaving the Burrow Behind
Harry had not wanted to celebrate his birthday. He had waited impatiently for it to come for only
one reason. He would be of age, he would be considered an adult in the wizarding world, which
would entitle him to do magic where and when he saw fit.
He woke on the morning of his seventeenth birthday, drenched in sweat from another fitful sleep.
He showered and dressed and headed down the stairs. Mrs. Weasley hugged him tightly as soon as
he appeared, she did not wish him a happy birthday but handed him a plate of fried eggs and toast
instead. Every meal she dished Harry up a full plate of food in the hopes that he would eat more
than a couple of mouthfuls.
‘Lupin will be here soon to take you for your apparation test’ she said as he plonked himself down at
the table.
‘Where’re Ron and Hermione?’ he had checked their rooms before coming down, and finding them
empty, had expected to see them at the kitchen table, tucking into breakfast.
‘They’ve already eaten’ she said ‘they’re outside somewhere’ When Harry immediately got up to
leave she pushed him back down in his seat. ‘Oh no you don’t!’ she said ‘you’ll eat first! And a
decent amount too this time.’ her voice was stern but her eyes were full of concern ‘You’re getting
- 33 -
thinner every day…’
Harry pushed the oozing eggs to the side of his plate and managed to down two pieces of toast and
butter. He waited until Mrs. Weasley had her back turned then left the table quietly and went
outside in search of his two best friends.
He found them huddled together under the enormous willow tree, in hushed conversation. Several
aurors were wandering the perimeter, eyeing Harry as he made his way over to Ron and Hermione.
As he neared them, they stopped whispering and looked up guiltily.
‘What’s up?’ Harry frowned down at them.
‘Nothing’ they said in unison. Harry looked from one to the other; his eyes narrowed ‘Right’
‘Lupin not here yet then?’ Ron said quickly
‘No … not yet … what were you just-’
‘I know you’ll be fine Harry’ Hermione interrupted ‘you’ve apparated a few times now … even
conducted a side-along … you’ll pass no problems.’ She said with a wave of her hand.
‘Maybe … but what were you-’
‘And if I can pass’ Ron said ‘you definitely can!’ Harry shrugged and opened his mouth to speak.
‘Did he say what time you’d be back?’ asked Hermione ‘Lupin I mean’
‘No, he didn’t … What-’
‘So how does it feel, knowing you can do magic whenever you want?’ Ron grinned at him
‘No different really’ Harry was beginning to lose his temper ‘what were you two-‘
‘Harry!’ Harry looked over his shoulder at Lupin, who was coming down the stone steps with Tonks
in his wake. He was carrying an empty milk bottle in one hand and his wand in the other. ‘Ready to
go?’
Harry turned towards him and nodded.
‘Good. Alright!’ Lupin motioned to two of the aurors nearby. ‘Ministry orders’ said Lupin in answer to
Harry’s frown ‘you’ve got to have at least two of them wherever you go.’ Harry recognized Dawlish
as he jogged over and nodded at Lupin, he did not know the other man. Lupin tapped the bottle
with his wand. ‘Portus’ the bottle glowed for a moment as it shook in Lupins hand, then returned to
normal.
Harry went to place his finger on the portkey but paused and looked back at Ron and Hermione and
said accusingly. ‘I’m not finished with you two yet!’ They raised their eyebrows as Harry turned his
attention back on the bottle. He placed his finger on it, looking around at the four faces opposite
him. He just had time register how over the top it seemed to have four escorts to the Ministry of
Magic for his apparation test, before he felt the familiar pull behind his navel and the world began to
swirl around him.
They were in the Atrium in the Ministry of Magic. It was much less bustling than it had been last
time Harry was here during opening hours. He noticed several wizards standing at the entrance to
the golden gates, all dressed in the same emerald robes that bore a Ministry badge on the right
hand side above the chest.
‘Ministry Guards’ whispered Tonks in Harry’s ear. The golden statues of the wizard, witch, centaur
and house elf that had been destroyed in the fight against Voldemort just over a year ago had not
been replaced. Instead only the platform remained, still surrounded by the pond Harry had thrown
numerous Galleons into when he had been on trial two years ago.
‘What’s that?’ Harry leant to one side to avoid a small, silent black orb, no bigger than a golden
snitch that glided passed him, circled back and then proceeded to weave through them.
‘It’s a Stalker’ Tonks continued ‘It’s sort of a floating eye that can think for itself’ Harry raised his
eyebrows ‘it’s extraordinarily useful. It will follow anyone it is suspicious of or has been told to
watch out for, relaying the images back to the receiver.’ Tonks was smiling as she watched it zoom
over to some new arrivals that had just entered through the floo network. ‘They are extremely rare,
the ministry has one of only three known in existence.’ She glanced sideways at Harry ‘The Order
could use one of those on you permanently.’ Harry was silently grateful they did not have one.
- 34 -
Once through security at the large golden gates, they headed to the elevators and disembarked at
Level Six where the Apparation Test Centre was located. They passed more of the Ministry guards
as Lupin guided Harry along the corridor. Suddenly a familiar voice sounded from behind them.
‘Harry!’
Harry sighed as he turned, preparing himself. ‘Can I have a word with you?’ Scrimgeour said as he
caught up to them ‘… in private’ he added looking at Lupin.
Harry shrugged ‘I still don’t have anything to tell you.’
Scrimgeour frowned and said ‘Maybe I have something to tell you.’
Harry eyed him for a moment before following him back down the corridor towards the lifts.
‘What?’ he said flatly.
‘There is a fair bit of speculation going on Harry, as to what you will do now you’ve come of age.’
Scrimgeour spoke in a low voice. ‘And after what happened the other night, the death of that young
girl … well,’ Harry could just make out the tell tail glistening of sweat on Scrimgeour face ‘quite
frankly, most people believe you will leave … disappear from public view.’
Harry could feel the anger creeping inside him but he kept his voice even ‘I don't see how that
concerns you. Seems to me that's my business now I'm an adult’
‘Unfortunately, that is not quite true, young man. You're somewhat of a special case, as you well
know. People would feel ... more secure if they knew you were around. After all, it is my job to
make sure people feel safe-'
‘I’m sure if you put the Death Eaters behind bars, find a way to stop the Dementors, and destroy
Voldemort, you’d be well on the way to making people feel secure.’
‘You’re being foolish.’ Scrimgeour's eyes narrowed, his voice suddenly growing cold ‘You need my
help … the Ministry’s protection.’
Harry looked back at Dawlish and the other auror ‘Take them back. I don’t want them. They’d be
better put to use elsewhere.’
‘You wont survive a month on your own out there.’ Scrimgeour said unpleasantly.
‘Stan Shuntpike is still locked up I take it?' Scrimgeour's scowl was enough of an answer. 'As I've
said before Minister, you should concentrate on the people who do need you.’ Harry said it with
deliberate pleasantness, then turned and left leaving an angry Scrimgeour at the lifts. He then
followed Lupin and Tonks through a door marked Apparation Test Centre.
It was as easy as Hermione had said it would be, although Harry still disliked the sensation. He
returned to the Atrium with the test instructor after Lupin spoke to him at length, and they took the
floo to Hogsmeade. Harry had to apparate himself in front of "The Hog's Head" and then do one
more jump to the boarded up Zonko’s before they returned. Once he had his license, he made his
way back to the Atrium with Lupin and Tonks, the two ministry aurors trailing behind, the Stalker
hovering over them quietly. Harry could almost see Scrimgeour sitting in his office watching them.
‘All right Harry; we’ll apparate to the gate at The Burrow. Ready?’ Lupin smiled faintly. Harry
nodded and closed his eyes tightly.
Once at The Burrow, he went to head inside but Tonks grabbed his arm lightly, ‘This way Harry’ she
said as she led him round to the back of the house. When they reached the backyard Harry stood
for a moment looking about him, wondering what was going on.
There were more than a dozen people milling around on the grass.
‘Hiya Harry!’ It was Angelina Johnson who noticed them first; she was standing with Alicia, Katie
and Ginny, waving at Harry with a big grin on her face. As they came forward to greet him, Harry
spotted Fred and George standing with Ron and Hermione, and next to them he almost couldn’t
believe it, was Hagrid.
‘What’s going on?’ Harry said, bewildered.
‘We thought you might like a round of Quidditch to celebrate getting your license.’ Ron was grinning
- 35 -
from ear to ear
‘But … how …’
‘Took a fair bit of organizing, but everyone was really keen to come.’
‘Course we were!’ said Fred ‘Not everyday you get your Apparation License, is it?’ chimed in George
with a wink.
‘I don’t … understand …’ Harry looked at Neville and Luna who were smiling broadly at him
‘Go and get your gear on!’ said Angelina, turning him back to the house. It was then that Harry
realized she was in full Quidditch garb, along with all the other old team members.
He left them behind feeling somewhat dazed as he climbed the stairs to change. It struck him that
this had been what Ron and Hermione were whispering about earlier, they must have organized it
over the past few days ... come to think of it, Pigwideon had seemed awfully excited lately, though
it had been hard to tell the difference considering his normal state of elation.
Harry was not fooled that it was to celebrate his Apparation license, and even though the thought of
celebrating his birthday had repulsed him only this morning, he felt deeply touched that Ron and
Hermione had gone to so much trouble.
When he emerged fully attired, Hagrid grinned at him ‘Thought you might be needin this.’ He
handed Harry the Firebolt he had left in his hut before leaving for Godric’s Hollow. The aurors and
Order members split up so some could station themselves around the field, and the original
Gryffindor Quidditch team (minus Wood who was overseas playing pro according to Angelina)
headed to the old paddock the Weasleys used for practice, talking amongst themselves.
Lupin and Tonks chatted to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid as they walked along and Dean and
Seamus were stifling smiles as Luna launched into an exaggerated explanation of how a Snorkelled
Mudlug Slug breathed through it’s snorkel part to a very interested looking Neville.
When Harry hit the field and launched himself into the air it felt like the weight of the world had
lifted off his shoulders. He let go of everything that had happened over the past few months and
flew around the paddock feeling freer than he had felt in a long time. George had brought a set of
real Quidditch balls with him, including the snitch, which Harry and Ginny raced after. She did not
show any sign of her last meeting with him, for which Harry was glad. He was still appreciative of
Ginny’s skill on a broom, even though he caught the snitch before her. She had incredible grace and
yet an aggressive drive that meant they almost collided a couple of times, though laughing it off as
they flew into another round.
Cheers were regularly heard from Seamus and Dean, and even Lupin could be heard saying a
triumphant Yes! Every now and then, much to Hagrid’s apparent surprise. Ron appeared to have no
problem with nerves in front of so few people, and made some spectacular saves to the roaring
delight of Mrs. Weasley.
‘I’m tempted to let them go through just so she doesn’t do that!’ Ron said to Harry about her
whooping.
Ron’s mum was a particularly enthusiastic supporter. At one point when Angelina scored an
extremely difficult goal in the makeshift hoops Mr. Weasley had set up, Mrs. Weasley threw her
hands up in the air and did a little victory dance with Neville looking on nervously like he thought
she might explode.
‘That is why we never bring mum to a match.’ Said Fred when he stopped near Harry.
It was the best day Harry could remember having in a long time, and when they finally retired to
the backyard for dinner, the mood at The Burrow was lighter than it had been yet. They all sat and
laughed and talked like there were no other cares to worry them. Harry ate so much he had to
slouch in the chair to make himself comfortable, and as the evening wore on he reluctantly waved
goodbye to his fellow Gryffindor students, and Luna and Hagrid. Not long after Mrs. Weasley went
off to bed followed by Mr. Weasley, and Lupin and Tonks left with Fred and George leaving just
Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny sitting by the fireside in the lounge.
- 36 -
Harry watched the flames dancing glow on Ginny’s red hair for a while as they sat in silence.
‘Thanks guys.’ Harry said quietly ‘It was a good day.’ Hermione’s eyes twinkled as she smiled at
him, her head leaning lazily on Ron’s chest. No one said anything; nothing needed to be said. The
four of them sat for the longest time, savouring their last peaceful moments together before Harry
finally rose and went to bed, the others trailing after him.
He lay in the silvery moonlight, thinking that this had been by far the best birthday he had ever
had. A smile crept across his face; he felt very lucky to have friends like Ron and Hermione. His
thoughts were interrupted suddenly and he turned his head as the bedroom door clicked open and a
small figure swept through and closed it quietly behind them. It padded over to the bed as Harry
lifted himself on his elbow.
That wonderful faint flowery smell filled his senses as Ginny scooted into bed alongside him with her
back to him, afraid he would turn her away. He closed his arm over her and pulled her to him. He
knew why she had come, he too had felt the need for her and though his head told him to make her
leave, his heart ached for her to stay.
Harry had longed to feel her warm body beside him and now that he held her close he could no
longer stop himself. He brushed her hair back with his hand and she turned her face to him.
Bending his head, he brought his lips to hers, a fire burning inside him. She gave herself to him as
hot tears trickled down her face.
It was the tenderest thing Harry had ever known, her lips were soft and warm and her taste was
sweet. His kisses grew more urgent as her hands on his bare skin sent shivers through him. He
could feel her unsteady breathing, her body weighted down by his. He kissed away the dampness
on her cheeks and buried his head in her neck as she entwined her fingers in his hair. The need in
him flared dangerously so he took some deep, ragged breaths before lifting his head and looking at
her. Though her green eyes smouldered with passion, Harry could see fear behind them as they
stared up at him. A dull ache pulsed through him ‘I cant’ he said breathing heavily.
Her eyes filled with tears ‘Harry’ she said throatily ‘please’ pulling his face to hers and kissing him
invitingly. He lost himself in her want as he kissed her deeply, welcoming the sensation of her
tongue on his. And when he finally looked down at her again he was searching her face. He could
see the doubt she tried to conceal. He swallowed hard, his body shaking with desire. ‘I cant’ he
pulled his weight off her; afraid he would give in if she kissed him like that again.
She threw the covers off and went to leave but Harry grabbed her by the wrist. ‘Don’t go’ He
whispered. She paused for a moment then allowed him to pull her back down, moulding herself to
his body, and as he lay there listening to her breathing, waiting for sleep to take them, his chest
pained with the thought that this could be their last time alone together.
~*~*~*~
Ginny’s lips brushed Harry’s cheek lightly as she slipped out of bed just before dawn. Harry opened
his eyes when he heard the door click shut and threw an arm over his forehead angrily. She had
offered him comfort he could not have sort for himself, but he was regretting his decision to lay with
her. Every step closer to her he took made it that much more dangerous for her. He rolled on his
side cursing himself for his weakness, hating himself for needing her.
As he looked at the gloomy shadows around the room his eyes fell on the small black chest Emerick
had given him. It had crouched there since he had first arrived at The Burrow, unopened and
unheeded. He flung his feet on the floor and pulled his wand from under the pillow and pointed it at
the thick white candle on his bedside cabinet. He narrowed his eyes … Incendio he thought. The
room remained in darkness. Harry redoubled his efforts and narrowed his eyes further still, casting
a piercing gaze at the deadened candle. Incendio! It ignited immediately, throwing off a gentle light
that filled the room by which Harry dressed.
He snatched up the chest and sat it down on the bed, examining the lock. It looked simple enough
so Harry pointed his wand at it. Alohomora he thought. Nothing happened. Determined to practice
- 37 -
his non-verbal spells he tired again Alohomora! Still nothing. Frustrated with himself he said aloud
‘Alohomora!’ fully expecting the rusted old lock to spring open; but it remained firmly shut. Harry
sighed and lifted the chest to the candlelight. He peered into the lock and could just make out
something jammed deep inside it.
He pointed his wand at the lock and stared hard at it Waddiwasi! Something shot out of the lock,
collided with Harry’s head then rebounded onto the floor. ‘Owe…’ he rubbed his hand at the
smarting patch of forehead while searching for what had hit him. He picked up what looked like an
old bit of chewed paper. He tossed it onto the bed with a scowl and turned his attention back on the
chest. Alohomora! He thought determinedly, the tip of his wand hovering next to the lock. It opened
with a small flock. Harry rested the chest on his knees so that it was close to the light and lifted the
lid.
On top there was a small scroll, stained and tattered, and frayed round the edges. Harry picked it
out and unrolled it carefully, studying the faded patchy writing that remained. The words near the
edge of the parchment were gone but he could make out most of it…
…rest Lily,

…member to use the m…

…ss you my darling Lily…
…unior a hug from his da…
…y love, James
It was almost as though his father had spoken to him from the grave as it must have been written
during the time they were in hiding. A knot formed in the pit of his stomach as he finally rolled it
back up and placed it carefully on the bed, turning back to the chest again.
Harry pulled out a couple of small badly tarnished, silver figurines. It took him a while staring at
them intently, to work out what they were. Both were of people, however one was of a bearded
man, tall and straight with a long pointed hat and a staff grasped in one hand, the other was of a
woman, dressed in flowing robes, her head adorned with an elaborate tiara. Harry turned them over
in his fingers, wondering why they looked familiar to him. He placed them on the bed next to the
scroll and dipped into the chest once again.
There was a pendant attached to a gold chain and an assortment of loose trinkets, all were
tarnished almost beyond recognition, though he could still make out a couple of them, one of which
appeared to be a miniature gold broom; if it had any magical properties, they had long since been
destroyed. The other was a stubby brass candle that was burnt and stained and also appeared to
hold no magical powers. The pendant looked like a wheel and it too was blackened round the edges.
After putting them aside, Harry reached in to find a blotchy white card resting on a mound of blue
cloth that had yellowed stains and scorch marks around the edges. He brought the card up to the
light and turned it over, and there, with smiles on their faces and a baby cradled in their arms, sat
James and Lily Potter. But unlike other photo’s Harry had seen of his mother and father, this James
and Lily’s smile did not reach their eyes. They were sitting in a brightly lit room on a long floral
couch, and Harry knew it was the sunroom Emerick had spoken of. The room where his mother
would sit and wait for James.
He placed it face up on the bed, alongside the other bits and pieces, and then peered into the chest
to remove the last item. When Harry lifted it out of the chest he was surprised by it’s spongy feel
and as he brought it closer to him he realized what he had mistaken for a wad of blue material was
actually a small teddy bear. One of its ears was burnt off and its shaggy blue fur was scorched and
patchy in places. It only had one eye and where a little red tongue should’ve been poking out, there
- 38 -
were only traces of thin red threads dangling aimlessly. Harry pulled at the loose threads with a
bittersweet smile on his face. It was grubby and tatty and worthy of the rubbish bin but it was a
small link in the chain that connected him to his past so he placed it back inside the chest carefully
before replacing the other items and closing the lid.
The pendant dangled from Harry’s hand as he stored the chest inside his trunk. He had
unconsciously decided not to pack it away with everything else and as he looked at it again he
thought of his mother and father and wondered if either of them had worn it very often. He placed
the pendant around his neck, tucking it into his clothes just as there was a knock at the door. Harry
grunted, wondering who it could be as the dawns light was only just beginning to creep across the
floor.
‘Hey’ Ron poked his head around the door, and seeing Harry dressed he entered and closed the
door behind him. ‘Thought you’d be up early. So today’s the day then.’
Harry nodded and smiled faintly.
‘Your not planning to go yet though … I mean, this early? Mum and dad’ll want to talk to you first.’
‘I’ve been thinking about where I should go.’ Harry looked out the window ‘I want to visit my
parents graves, but I don't think it would be a smart thing to do right now.’ He could see the
ministries aurors slouched around the yard.
‘Yeah’ Ron joined him at the window ‘There’s always The Headquarters’ he shrugged ‘I mean, it’s
yours now anyhow.’ Harry didn’t relish the thought of returning there. Sirius had regarded it as a
prison before he died, and it was one of the least homely places you could imagine.
‘I think I’ll go back there … at least for now.’ He looked at Ron ‘Maybe they’ve finally managed to
remove Sirius’s mums portrait.’ he said with a wry smile.
‘I wouldn’t count on it mate’ Ron smiled as he led Harry out of the room ‘Something tells me she’s
one stubborn old witch!’
‘Alright, Harry?’ Tonks greeted him as they entered the kitchen, dangling a bit of egg-white from
her fork.
‘You two, sit!’ Mrs. Weasley said sharply, she was bustling about with the pots and pans looking
highly agitated. Harry tried to catch Ron’s eye but he seemed extremely concerned with where his
feet were going as he moved to the table and sat without a word. Mrs. Weasley unceremoniously
plonked a large bowl full of scrambled eggs between them before she sent two plates flying their
way. Harry had to duck and use his lightening reflexes to grasp his plate as it came close to taking
his head off, and Ron’s flew right passed him and shattered against the wall behind. Harry pulled
out his wand Reparo! He handed Ron the newly repaired plate.
‘Oh!’ A dish piled high with bacon that Mrs. Weasley had been sending their way turned on its head
as she blustered out of frustration. She waved her wand heatedly and the spilled bacon flew to the
bin. Then she turned her back to them and started frying a new batch, mumbling grumpily under
her breath.
‘What’s wrong with her?’ mouthed Harry at Tonks, giving up on Ron who seemed to be avoiding
him. Tonks gave a non-committal shrug as she took another mouthful. Hermione appeared not long
after, looking around at their faces sheepishly. She seemed to be aware of the tension as she sat at
the table and watched Mrs. Weasley float the newly cooked bacon over to them while the pan in the
sink cleaned itself.
Before the bacon dish could land safely on the table however, it began to spin wildly in mid air.
Pieces of bacon flew off in all directions as Harry, Ron and Hermione ducked for cover, and Tonks
was on her feet and with a wave of her wand the now empty plate came to a rest in the middle of
the table.
Mrs. Weasley was beside herself. ‘Oh not another one!’
‘Maybe I’d better cook the bacon, Molly’ Tonks said as she flicked her wrist, bits of bacon lifting into
the air and flinging themselves in the bin.
‘NO!’ Mrs. Weasley started ‘Oh … er … I mean, that’s quite alright dear, I can manage.’ She
obviously thought the damage she was doing was still preferable to unleashing Tonks in the kitchen.
- 39 -
‘Morning all!’ Harry looked up and saw Mr. Weasley come through the door, Ginny trailing behind.
As he watched her remove her coat their eyes met briefly, but she looked away quickly before
moving to the table and sitting opposite him. There were no more accidents with the bacon after
that as they sat and ate, verbally replaying some of the previous days Quidditch.
Ginny ate in silence, pushing the food around her plate impatiently, seemingly annoyed about
something. Harry had never felt sorry for a mushroom before, but watching Ginny stabbing at hers
repeatedly with her fork gave him the rather uncomfortable feeling that she was not seeing a
mushroom at all. Once she had reduced it to tatters she shoved it to one side of the plate and
started in on an unsuspecting piece of tomato.
‘Harry, I’d like to have a chat with you, if I may?’ As the breakfast was being cleared Mr. Weasley
lifted himself from the table and headed for the lounge. Harry followed, feeling all eyes on them. ‘Sit
down, Harry’ Mr. Weasley said as Harry entered the room. He stood with his arm resting on the
mantelpiece above the cold fireplace. ‘Lupins informed me that you will be leaving us today?’
‘Yes’ Harry said quietly.
Mr. Weasley raised one eye brow ‘I cant say I’m surprised. In fact, every morning I come down I’ve
been half expecting you to be gone.’ He spoke sombrely now ‘Without Moody here I’m almost
certain that would have been the case a week ago. Have you thought about where you’re going?’
Harry nodded ‘To Head Quarters.’ Mr. Weasley moved over to the armchair next to Harry and
perched himself on the edge of it.
‘Harry ... you're like a son to Molly and I,’
Harry felt a dull ache in the pit of his stomach as Mr. Weasley went on quietly ‘our home is your
home, and it always will be. If you want to come back … if you ever need a place to go, remember
that.’ Harry didn’t speak; fearing his voice would be unsteady. Mr. Weasley sighed deeply ‘Now that
you’ve come of age there’s one or two things you need to know.’ Mr. Weasley was eyeing him with
a mixture of curiosity and sadness ‘I think its time you became a member of The Order of The
Phoenix ... if you still want to-'
‘Of course I do.’ Harry said quickly.
Mr. Weasley nodded ‘I’ll arrange to have you inducted tomorrow. How are you getting to Head
Quarters? Have you arranged to meet Lupin there?’
Harry shook his head and swallowed ‘I’m going alone.’
‘No you’re not.’ Ron and Hermione were standing in the doorway watching them. ‘I told you once
before mate, Hermione and I are staying with you.’ Ron was looking at Harry seriously as he walked
forward ‘Hogwarts doesn’t start for a month, until then we go where, you go.’
‘No, I don’t-‘
‘Don’t argue with them!’ Mrs. Weasley appeared with Tonks at her side. Her eyes were watering as
she looked sternly at Harry. ‘The three of you have been best friends for six years, and if ever there
was a time you needed each other it’s now.’
‘Molly’s right,’ Mr. Weasley put his arm on Harry’s shoulder as he peered from Ron to Mrs. Weasley
‘you might as well accept it, I don’t suppose you have any choice in the matter anyway.’
Harry could see Ginny in the kitchen behind Mrs. Weasley. She was sitting with her elbows on the
table and her face in her hands.
'Well...' Harry began.
‘Good! Glad that’s settled.’ Ron said, then turning his eyes on Harry he asked briskly ‘When are we
leaving?’
‘As soon as we can.’ Harry said slowly, never taking his eyes off her.
6. R.A.B. and Snape
- 40 -
Harry, Ron and Hermione stood outside number 13 Gimmauld Place. Ron was holding pig's cage in
one hand, the tiny owl flapping around excitedly within while Crookshanks, who was curled around
Hermiones feet, eyed him impatiently. Sturgis Podmore and Hestia Jones were arguing behind
them.
‘Don’t be ridiculous, Sturgis! How on earth am I going to carry that?’ said Hestia, pointing at Ron’s
trunk.
‘Well you can’t float it in the middle of the street in broad daylight, can you?’ Sturgis said as he
struggled with Hermiones book laden luggage.
‘We’ll come back out for it,’ said Harry over his shoulder. He and Ron were each holding an end of
Harry’s trunk. Hermione was loaded down with parcels Mrs. Weasley had piled on top of her before
they left. She had apparently completely emptied her kitchen cupboards in an effort to ensure they
didn’t "fade away to nothing" while they were out of her care.
They walked through the small gate and up the path; Harry stopped and concentrated Number
twelve Gimmauld Place The Black Family home expanded before their eyes, looking as dull and
dingy as Harry remembered it. He pulled his wand out when they reached the front door, and
tapped it near the twisted serpent-handle.
'Alohomora!' There was no familiar clicking of locks.
‘No, no … you cant do it like that.’ Hestia pushed her way passed Harry, she raised her wand and
tapped the door ‘Open Sesame!’
Harry and Hermione exchanged looks as the locks clanked open behind the door. Ron, however was
oblivious to the meaning of the password, he was tapping on Pig's cage in an effort to subdue her.
‘Who set the password?’ but before Harry had even finished asking he knew.
‘Dumbledore. Seemed to think it was rather amusing … cant think why.’ Hestia was obviously from
an all-magic family, like Ron.
'Shut up Pig!' Ron said in a hushed voice. No one spoke as Harry and Ron placed their load carefully
in the hall and then went out to collect the other trunk. Hestia and Sturgis relieved Hermione of
some of her teetering packages and once they had retrieved the other trunk Harry and Ron stopped
to look around. To his dismay Harry noticed the curtains that covered Sirius’ mums portrait were
still there, though the other paintings had gone. The shrunken house-elf heads had also been
removed. (Harry was thankful but silently wondered what Kreacher would have to say if he knew)
‘You take these,’ Sturgis whispered as he emptied his parcels onto Ron ‘we’ll be outside on duty.’
Hestia unloaded hers onto Harry and smiled wryly at him ‘Welcome home!’ She and Sturgis closed
the door behind them leaving the three of them standing in the gloomy hall in silence.
‘Let’s take these to the kitchen.’ Hermione whispered, and they headed through the cramped
doorway and down the stairs, Ron still clutching Pig's cage and Crookshanks following. The kitchen
was cold, damp and gloomy and even less friendly now that Sirius was gone. They tipped their
packages onto the table.
‘I’ll get a fire going.’ Ron said and he placed Pig on the sideboard and strode off towards the sitting
room.
‘Might as well get this stuff put away.’ Hermione sighed and began opening the parcels. Harry
picked up a piece of parchment that was lying on the bench top.
Harry,
I hope this note finds you as I feel here is the safest place for you now.
There’s a few supplies in the cupboard even though I am sure Molly did not let you leave empty
handed.
Try not to disturb Mrs. Black’s portrait, I have found her most disagreeable of late.
- 41 -
I’ve organized for Hagrid to send Hedwig on to you, I should be back in a couple of days.
There will be Order guards on duty round the clock in the meantime,
Lupin
Harry smiled. The moon had been bright last night, so he guessed there must be a full moon due.
Harry knew Lupin was no longer able to go undercover to infiltrate the werewolf underworld, of
which he was secretly glad. Greyback would have seen him fighting against the Death Eaters at
Hogwarts that night and Snape was bound to have given his master the names of all The Order
members by now. As Harry's thoughts turned to Snape he felt his blood boil.
‘Once we’ve got this lot sorted, we’ll go up and unpack.’ Hermione was stuffing the shelves,
glancing at Harry every now and then. Harry did not speak for some time, his mind was whirling
with the thought of how much Snape knew. He had known that whilst Dumbledore was The Orders
secretkeeper, no one except him could say the location of Headquarters. Now however with
Dumbledore gone, he began to wonder if Snape was able to reveal the location of twelve Gimmauld
Place.
He looked at Ron who was stoking a roaring fire and opened his mouth to speak. Twelve Grimmauld
Place! His lips would not form the words and no sound came out. ‘Harry?’ he realized Ron was
looking at him with a curious expression on his face.
‘We’re finished here, let’s go.’ Harry said as Hermione put the last loaf of bread away.
Harry took Sirius’s room up the top of the stairs while Ron took Pig to the room he and Harry had
shared. Hermione retreated to where she and Ginny had slept last time. They made up their beds
with clean linen left over from when Mrs. Weasley had been there and met back down in the kitchen
around lunchtime. Crookshanks purred as he sat curled by the fire. Ron started to pull food from the
cupboards and Hermione busied herself laying the table.
‘I think we should take another look at that locket and note after lunch.’ Harry was standing by the
fire, staring at the flames as they licked high into the air. ‘It’s all we’ve got to go on.’
‘I’ve been thinking about that.’ Said Hermione, placing three cups beside the plates ‘What if R.A.B.
isn’t a person?’ Harry looked her.
‘Whadya mean?’ Ron said doubtfully ‘What else could it be?’
Hermione shrugged ‘I don’t know, it’s just that I’ve already looked up the well known powerful
witches and wizards, remember? And none of them seemed the least bit likely to have written it.’
‘Maybe they’re not well known … whoever they are.’ Ron said
‘That will make our job next to impossible then,’ said Harry, looking into the fire again.
Harry remained quietly by the fire as Ron and Hermione launched into an argument over sandwich
fillings. The enormity of the task ahead of him seemed insurmountable, and yet Dumbledore had
trusted him to go on. He had believed Harry capable of overcoming the odds. But then Dumbledore
had also trusted Snape. He felt sick to the stomach every time he thought about it. But he had no
choice but to go on and do the best he could. Over the past week Harry had developed a renewed
sense of urgency. He was running out of time, he could feel it. Voldemort had wanted Harry to
alienate himself for only one reason. He was coming for him.
‘Harry,’ Hermione dished up a large plate of sandwiches and sat down next to Ron. Harry turned
from the fire slowly, not feeling a bit like eating anymore.
‘C’mon,’ said Ron ‘you’ll be hungry later and we’re not going to stop until dinner.’
‘That’s right,’ said Hermione gravely reading Harry’s face ‘we’ll get somewhere with it today … I
know we will.’ They sat and ate in silence.
~*~*~*~
‘Arrrgh!’ Hermione let out a frustrated groan ‘I’m going to need more parchment but this is all I’ve
got until we pick up some school supplies. Have either of you two got any?’ She had been working
- 42 -
through complicated permutations of the R.A.B. letters, trying to figure out if they had hidden
meanings. This was her last desperate resort to find something that would unlock what happened to
the original locket, and now she had finally run out of space on her lone roll of parchment. They had
worked through without dinner because none of them had felt like eating. Ron’s efforts scanning
through books he had found in the study upstairs had not yielded any results either. All their time
spent troubling over the problem had come to nothing and it was past eight o’clock.
Harry and Ron shook their heads in answer ‘Might find some upstairs in one of the desks.’ Harry
said as he stared into the fire again, feeling frustrated and useless. He hadn’t been of any help at
all, from the moment he sat down it was as if a huge mental block went up around him. Hermione
lifted herself off the rug by the fire and jogged up the stairs.
‘Don’t suppose you’ve had any brainwaves?’ Ron was looking exactly how Harry felt as he turned
another book over in his hands.
‘No … nothing’
‘You know, for all our efforts I get the horrible feeling the answer is staring us in the face’ Ron said.
‘Yeah … like we’re missing something.’
‘Or reading too much into it!’ Ron tilted his head to the ink covered parchment on the floor.
Harry didn’t want to admit it, but he was beginning to think Ron was right. The lack of sleep over
the past couple of months had dulled Harry’s brain, and he suspected the sleepless nights spent in
his room at The Burrow had had a similar effect on his two best friends. He made up his mind to try
from now on to get a better nights sleep.
‘Harry!’ Hermiones voice from behind them sounded so strange that both Harry and Ron turned in
their chairs to look at her. Her face was ghostly white as she stood with a fresh piece of parchment
clutched in her hand. They jump up immediately.
‘What’s wrong?’ Harry said urgently.
‘Hermione! … What’s happened? … Did you get bitten by a doxy or something?’ Ron grabbed her
hands and started pulling her sleeves up, inspecting her arms.
‘No!’ she breathed then looked at Harry ‘I know who R.A.B. is.’
‘Who?’
‘I’ll show you,’ Harry and Ron exchanged looks and followed her as she led them up the stairs 'I was
hunting around for some parchment and for some reason I stopped to look at it' she was saying
'and there it was' She had reached the first floor and was heading into the drawing room. She finally
stopped in front of the sprawling Black family tree tapestry, pointing at the very bottom of it. Harry
and Ron leaned in squinting at the writing. There, in tiny black letters was the name Regulus Black.
‘Sirius’ brother?’ Ron said incredulously, but Harry knew from the moment he had seen the name
that she was right.
‘Why didn’t I see it earlier' he said darkly.
'He was a Death Eater, he must have been close to Voldemort!’ said Hermione.
‘Sirius said that his brother had wanted out before the end,' Harry spoke quietly 'when he found out
the lengths Voldemort was going to, to gain power.’
Ron looked stunned ‘Maybe it wasn’t the usual Death Eater activities that made him turn on V-
Voldemort, maybe he found out about the Horcruxes?’
‘It could explain why he suddenly did a turn around.’ Hermione agreed
‘Regulus was a purist,’ Harry said with distaste ‘that’s why he joined the Death Eaters, but if he
found out about the Horcruxes he would have realized Voldemorts true agenda, total domination
and immortality.’
‘Not just elitism’ Hermione added.
‘It all fits’ Harry said gravely.
‘But Voldemort killed Regulus didn’t he?’ Ron asked
‘Yeah … or at least his Death Eaters did. But he must have had time to retrieve the locket before
they found him. R.A.B. was pretty sure his own death was immanent.’
- 43 -
‘Well that’s it then!’ said Ron confidently ‘He found the locket and destroyed it before the Death
Eaters got to him!’
‘But he didn’t know how to destroy the locket!’ Hermione put her hand out to Harry ‘Give me the
note.’ Harry pulled it out of his pocket and handed it to her, she unfolded it ‘See … he wrote that he
was going to destroy the locket as soon as he could.’
‘So did he destroy it before they caught up with him?’ Ron looked to Harry who was deep in
thought.
'We wont know until we find it.' Hermione frowned
‘But how did he get it?’ Harry said aloud, then he looked between the two of them ‘I mean, it was
protected by very powerful magic,’ his voice went flat ‘even Dumbledore had trouble, and it took the
two of us. Dumbledore said it couldn’t be done alone.’
‘Maybe he took a fellow Death Eater along who wanted out too?’ Ron suggested.
‘No … Voldemort made it so that only one wizard could get to it,' Harry said darkly 'and then he
enchanted it so that only two people could actually remove it.’ He hated thinking about what he had
done to Dumbledore in the cave. It had all been for nothing. The locket was a fake.
Their state of excitement was slowly being replaced by disappointment. The answer they found had
raised even more questions. They left the room and headed back to the warmth of the sitting room,
discussing the possibilities. Hermione made some tea and they slouched in their chairs sipping it
dejectedly, Crookshanks curling into her lap. Their conversations seemed to take them in circles,
always the same questions popped up. It was late by the time Harry decided they were going to get
no further with it tonight, so they cleaned up and headed off to their separate rooms.
Harry was feeling worn out. The excitement of finding out R.A.B.’s identity, and the consequent
questions it had produced had left Harry wondering yet again about the seeming impossibility of the
task ahead of him. He threw off his clothes, leaving only a t-shirt and pants on for warmth, and slid
under the blankets. Before long he sank into the darkness of sleep.
~*~*~*~
There was a dull thud.
Then a slithery snake like feel intruding on Harry's skin. He squirmed slightly as he half-woke from
sleep. He opened his eyes partially and tried to shift his position. But he seemed unable to move.
He tried to rouse himself; his eyes opening and closing in the darkness, then suddenly, something
wrapped itself around his face, sliding across his mouth and parting his lips with force. Harry let out
a strangled gasp as he went to sit up, the panic rising in him, but he fought against something that
bit painfully into his skin. He tried to yell but only a muffled groan escaped the dry wad in his
mouth.
All traces of sleep had left him, his arms were pinned at his sides and his eyes were wide open as
he thrashed about trying to break loose of the restraints that held him down. There was a sudden
burst of light and his heartbeat raced. His eyes narrowed at the glare as they searched the area in
front of him. A dark figure was coming into focus. Harry felt a droplet of sweat roll down his
forehead as the figure moved to stand over him.
His stomach lurched painfully as he looked into the cold dark eyes of Severus Snape.
~*~*~*~
Snape’s greasy hair hung over the bed as his hand came down towards Harry’s face. Harry groaned
and pulled his head away. He did not want to die like this, bound and gagged, useless and at
Snape’s mercy! His eyes followed Snape’s hand as it slipped under his pillow and pulled out the
wand that lay hidden beneath. Harry fought against his bonds as a wave of nausea flooded through
him. Snape was going to kill him with his own wand!
- 44 -
‘I’d stay still if I were you.’ Snape said indifferently. Harry closed his eyes and let his head drop
back on the pillow. Snape was going to kill him in the same cowardly way he had murdered
Dumbledore. Harry began to shake as anger seeped through every nerve and fibre of his body.
He would not die like this! He would not lay here helplessly waiting! And with the strength of a
madman, Harry suddenly thrust himself against the coarse ropes that ensnared him and for a
moment it seemed that they loosened. But just as quickly they pressed in on him again, even
tighter than before, cutting into his flesh. Snape watched him with a raised eyebrow.
‘You never know when to give up, do you’ seemingly bored by Harry’s useless determination. Harry
squirmed; he struggled to draw breath into his lungs as the binds around him squeezed in on his
body. ‘Once again you’re making things harder for yourself … you should learn to do as your told.’
Harry could feel the dampness of blood on his skin around the white-hot gouges the ropes inflicted.
His eyes stung from the pain as he glared at Snape.
‘What? No witty come back?’ Sarcasm dripped from Snape’s voice. Harry seethed as he let out a
muffled roar of angry frustration. ‘Unfortunately, although this conversation would be far more
productive one way, it is necessary that you speak. I shall remove the gag in your mouth …
however,’ Snape leaned in menacingly ‘if you should decide to yell for help, you will be sealing the
fate of whomever comes to your aide. Do you understand?’ Harry felt sick as he remembered Ron
and Hermione were only a floor below. He gave a slight nod; he would not call them to their deaths.
Snape straightened and pointed his wand at Harry’s face. The gag slid from his lips and retreated to
the pillow. Harry ploughed his tongue around his dry mouth ‘What do you want?’ making no attempt
to hide his hatred.
Snape sneered ‘As unlikely as it seems, you and I have a common problem.’
‘Yeah, you!’
‘Ah… that delightful wit of yours again.’ Snape mocked smoothly.
‘I wasn’t being funny’ Harry said through gritted teeth. ‘Get me out of these ropes!’
‘I’m afraid I cant do that, you see, I know you would attack me’ Snape’s silky voice taunted ‘and
then I would have to hurt you...’ he looked down at the blood that seeped through Harry's sheets
‘again.’ he mocked distatefully.
Harry’s hatred was complete. There was no longer any trace of fear in his voice when he spoke.
‘You’re a pathetic coward who only attacks people who cant fight back!’ All traces of amusement
dropped away from Snape's face as he lifted his wand and renewed its aim. ‘You’re not going to
disobey your master are you?’ Harry goaded him recklessly ‘doesn’t he want me for himself. He
wont be pleased with you if you do the job for him, will he now?’
Snape’s wand began to tremble slightly as his lip curled in fury. Harry thought that any minute
Snape would lose the battle that obviously raged within. But it appeared his fear of Voldemort was
greater than his loathing for Harry. He lowered his wand slowly.
‘You are so sure of yourself, Potter.' His distaste evident. Then he added smoothly 'One of these
days, your wanton behaviour will get you into more trouble than even you can squirm out of.'
‘What do you want’ Harry’s jaw was clenched in rage. Snape’s face darkened.
‘I am here to offer you Bellatrix LeStrange.’
Harry’s jaw slackened as his eyes narrowed ‘What?’
‘You want her for what she did to that young girl,’ he said and raised an eyebrow ‘Not to mention
that fool of a Godfather of yours.’
‘Don’t you dare talk about Sirius like that!’ Harry tried to sit up again, but winced painfully as the
ropes tore at his raw wounds ‘He was a hundred times the man you’ll ever be.’ His anger dulled the
pain as he struggled once more.
‘Really?’ Snape said with amused contempt. ‘Yes ... well, he did spend twelve highly productive
years in prison, not to mention two memorable years in hiding on the run.' he mocked 'Clearly he is
worthy of such high regard.’
- 45 -
‘You better hope these ropes hold because if I get free I’m going to tear you to pieces with my bare
hands!’ Harry roared, he was using every ounce of strength he had left in him to fight his bonds,
but once again they tightened so severely that Harry thought he might pass out unable to breathe.
‘You’re still as stupid and as arrogant as your father was! The more you struggle, the tighter they
get.’ Snape sneered down at him ‘Lay still for a minute and you will be able to breathe, struggle…’
Snape raised his brow ‘and you will faint. I know you better than you know yourself, Potter. You
want LeStrange ... and I can give her to you.’ Harry’s blood was boiling but his head swam
dangerously from lack of oxygen. Sweat dripped into his eyes as he forced himself to relax and after
a moment his lungs could expand more easily.
‘Some sense at last.’ Snape said lightly. Harry could tell Snape was enjoying the control he had over
him.
‘Why Bellatrix?’ Harry panted, his anger had not abated; it coursed through him suppressed only by
his want to hear Snape out.
‘My reasons are my own.’ Snape said coldly ‘I will tell you where and when, and all you need to do
is not-mess-it-up,’ he scowled ‘if that is at all possible.’
‘Your even madder than I thought if you think I would trust you after what you did!’
Snape scoffed ‘I do not expect you to trust me.’ He said contemptuously ‘But you will do as I say.
It’s the only way you will get LeStrange … and you want her, I know you do.’ he added darkly.
Harry looked up at the ceiling. He did want her; he wanted her so badly he could taste it. What if
Snape was telling the truth? What if he could deliver her to Harry so he could make her pay. The
thought of it consumed him. ‘What do I have to do?’
‘I will let you know when the time is right. In the meantime’ Snape turned Harry's face to him with
the tip of his wand, and leaning in he said darkly ‘you must not tell anyone of our meeting. No one,
do you understand? If you do, then not only will you not get Bellatrix, but you will find I will not be
as pleasant the next time we meet.’
‘There wont be a next time, Snape!’ Harry hissed.
Snape momentarily faulted at the way Harry had addressed him but he recovered quickly to a look
of distain ‘I will release your bonds and then I will leave. Remember what I said, Potter. You tell no
one!’ Snape waved Harry’s wand at him and Harry’s body stiffened as the bonds slunk away and
disappeared. Harry watched out of the corner of his eyes as Snape put the wand back under his
pillow and then flick his own wand once, extinguishing the only source of light. The room fell into
blackness and the sound of the bedroom door closed, signalling Snape's departure.
Harry lay motionless, furious at having been so easily overcome by Snape. His need to avenge
Gabrielle meant he would bide his time. He would do as they had agreed. But one day soon he
would have his chance with Snape.
As he lay there wondering how long the curse Snape had thrown at him would last, he became
aware of the burning pain from his open wounds. Warm blood trickled down his skin uncomfortably.
After a time, Harry felt his body relax.
He lifted himself painfully off the bed and bathed, washing off the excess blood carefully. The warm
water stung at the gashes across his chest and legs that turned out to be deeper than he had
expected. Harry threw his torn and bloodied t-shirt in a drawer and pulled out his wand. He pointed
it at the small splatters of blood that covered the sheets Tergeo! Hermione had used the spell to
clean blood from his face last year, but the sheets remained stained.
Harry concentrated harder. This time the blood siphoned off leaving starkly white sheets again.
Seeing that his wounds had started bleeding again Harry wiped them off impatiently and summoned
some dressings, (though basic as he was not well versed in healing) to quell any further bleeding.
Ron and Hermione must not find out he was hurt. Harry knew what their reactions would be; they
would be horrified and try to convince Harry to report it. Then his chance to bring Bellatrix in would
be gone.
- 46 -
Harry was looking around inspecting the room for traces of blood he might have missed when there
was a sharp tapping at the window. He automatically spun round, clutching his chest as it protested
painfully. He breathed heavily, wincing as he looked to the source of the noise.
There was a flurry of snowy white feathers hovering outside the window in the morning gloom.
Harry walked over to the window somewhat gingerly and opened it. Hedwig fluttered in with a
gentle hoot, carrying the backpack Harry had left at Hagrids, though Harry was glad to notice it
looked much less full than he had left it. She let the bag drop on the floor and landed on the
dressing table, looking somewhat pleased with herself as she lifted her leg for Harry to remove the
small scroll that was tied there.
He gave Hedwig an affectionate scratch that she seemed to enjoy even more than usual. ‘I missed
you too girl’ Harry smiled warmly ‘I’m glad your with me again. I’ll get you something to eat.’ He
dug out some owl treats and placed them on the top of the cupboard, letting out a small gasp of
pain as he stretched. Hedwig stayed where she was, eyeing Harry reproachfully. ‘It’s alright Hedwig,
it’s nothing.’ She still did not move ‘Go on, go!’ he laughed softly at her concern. She fluttered up to
her perch atop the cupboard and trilled gently. Harry gave her a bowl of water then sat down
carefully, mindful of the pain as he read the message.
Hullo Harry,
Hedwigg has been diein to get back to you
Been pesterin me ever sins I got back from the Hollow
GRAWP says hullo too.
Hope yer sumwher safe,
don’t go doin aneethin dangerus
Say hullo to Ron and Hermione fer me
Hope to see you soon
Hagrid
It warmed Harry’s heart to hear from Hagrid, and for a short time he managed to forget about the
nights events, turning his attention to GRAWP. He wondered how Hagrid was getting along with his
Giant brother, from what he had seen at the funeral it appeared Hagrid had managed to get GRAWP
under control, although he had not mentioned anything about the giants and whether they were yet
teamed with Voldemort.
When he heard shuffling coming from downstairs he threw on his clothes and went down to the
kitchen.
Hermione was busy making porridge in a large pot on the stove. She had already lit the fire so
Harry went over to warm himself after greeting her. Crookshanks was lurking around her feet but as
soon as Harry sat down he jumped into his lap, purring as he rubbed his head along Harry’s chest.
‘Owe’ Harry pulled Crookshanks away from his wounds and held him aloft, ‘Not today Crookshanks,
sorry’ he said quietly. He plonked the cat on the floor and went over to help Hermione. Ron joined
them as the breakfast was laid.
‘Had the strangest dream last night.’ he said scratching his head ‘I was watching the Weird Sisters
play a concert but their music was really off, it sounded really flat, like the same note right through.
Everyone was booing and throwing stuff on the stage. In the end they broke all their instruments
and stalked off the stage.’ Harry frowned.
‘Now you mention it,’ Hermione sat down next to him ‘I remember dreaming I was on the Hogwarts
express. Cant remember any of the details though, just the awful monotonous drone of the
engines.’ Harry looked between the two of them. Snape had used the Muffliato charm on Ron and
Hermione to ensure they would not be heard.
- 47 -
‘What?’ Ron was watching Harry.
‘Nothing,’ he took a spoon and filled his bowl ‘Hedwig arrived this morning.’
‘Any news?’
‘No. Just a note from Hagrid; he said to say hello.’
As the morning drew on, Hermione turned their conversation back to R.A.B. ‘We need to find out
what he did with the locket. Harry I think you’re right; the first thing we need to figure out is how
he managed to get it.’
‘Yeah, I mean he wasn’t anything special, was he?’ Ron frowned.
‘What do we know about the defences that guarded it?’ She asked Harry.
‘Like I said, only one wizard could cross to the island in the boat, and once there’ Harry’s voice
lowered at the memory ‘it would take two people to remove it from the potion.’
‘But you went across in the boat with Dumbledore, didn’t you?’ Ron puzzled.
‘Yes, but he said that didn’t count because I wasn’t considered a proper wizard until I was of age.’
‘What else happened?’ Hermione prodded delicately.
‘Dumbledore made me promise to make him drink all of the potion protecting the locket’ he said
grimly ‘no matter what he said once he started drinking it.’
‘Why?’ Ron asked.
‘Because he knew it was going to be impossible for him to do it himself. He knew that whatever it
was ... it would cripple him.’ Harry was unable to look either of them in the face. Dumbledore's
desperate pleas swamped him painfully. ‘I fed him that poison … glass after glass … until he was
almost dead.’
‘You did what you had to, mate.’ Ron said quietly watching him.
‘Ron’s right … he made you promise for a reason, Harry.’
‘Once the potion was gone, the inferi attacked because I had to use the water from the lake to give
Dumbledore a drink.’ Harry looked up into their horrified faces. ‘They came up out of the water and
grabbed me. They would have pulled me in if Dumbledore hadn’t used fire to scare them off.’
‘Oh Harry! That’s horrible…’ Hermiones eyes watered.
They were silent for a moment until Harry spoke again ‘Point is you’d have to have some powerful
magic behind you, not only to get through Voldemorts defences, but to detect magic as well.’ Harry
explained how Dumbledore had felt traces of magic.
‘Regulus would have to have had someone along who was powerful enough to detect traces of
magic and defend them against the inferi. He wouldn’t have been in any state to do it himself after
drinking the potion.’ Harry said gravely
‘Regulus couldn’t have been anywhere near as powerful as Dumbledore.’ Ron added.
‘So …’ Hermione recounted ‘Regulus took someone along who wasn’t a wizard so they could get
across the lake … but who had great power of their own to detect magic and defeat the inferi … and
who would also do exactly what they were told to do even under incredible circumstances.’
The three of them looked into the fire for a moment then one by one they looked at each other
‘Kreacher!’ Ron spoke what they had all been thinking.
7. Ginny’s Other and Harry's Excuse
They were interrupted by a loud crash followed by a shrill screeching coming from above. They
pulled out their wands and ran across the room, edging quietly up the stairs.
‘… POND SCUM! INTRUDERS IN MY NOBLE HOUSE! TRAITORS TO YOUR BLOOD! …’
Something had obviously disturbed the portrait of Mrs. Black. She was screaming at the top of her
- 48 -
lungs. ‘MUDBLOODS AND TRAITORS! GET OUT! WHERE IS KREACHER AND THAT UNGRATEFUL
BRAT CHILD OF MINE? GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! ARGGGGH! STAY AWAY FROM ME! … GET AWAY!’
Mrs. Black’s screams suddenly became more hysterical as Harry peered out from the stairwell.
‘Shut-up-or-I-will-curse-you-until-you-are-nothing-but-a-blob-of-paint’ Ginny said threateningly
‘And don’t think I don’t know how’ Harry and the others emerged from the doorway to find Tonks
battling her way out from under a heap of bags, apologizing profusely, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley
looking on dumbfounded as Ginny stood in duelling stance, wand pointing at Mrs. Blacks portrait.
Mrs. Black was hunched in the corner of her painting with her elbow in front of her face. ‘Nooo…’
she wailed pitifully.
Harry and Ron rushed over and to their surprise the curtains pulled shut with no resistance. They
turned to look at Ginny; her eyes were glittering dangerously.
‘Where did that come from?’ Ron was looking at his sister with a mixture of shock and awe.
‘She’s a horrible old bat who deserves a bit of her own back.’ Ginny said angrily, pulling herself up
straight again.
‘Yes … well’ Mrs. Weasley was eyeing Ginny uncertainly ‘I think it best if we get this stuff upstairs
before she starts up again.’
‘Somehow I don’t think that will be a problem.’ Harry said eyeing Ginny appreciatively. Ginny gave
him a piercing look as she picked up the small cage containing Albert, her pink pigmy puff.
‘I’ll put some tea on then, shall I?’ Tonks appeared unabashed by Ginny’s display as she turned and
started down the stairs towards the kitchen, Hermione and Ginny in tow. Harry felt a stab of pain in
the pit of his stomach as he watched her go. She had never looked so … cold.
‘What are you doing here?’ Ron took Mr. Weasleys bags and Harry picked up the ones Tonks had
dropped, then they made their way upstairs.
‘Induction day, remember?’ he said as they piled into an empty room on the first floor.
‘Take those into Hermiones room will you dear?’ Mrs. Weasley nodded at the bags Harry was
carrying ‘Ginny can bunk in with her again.'
Harry turned and headed to Hermiones room. He plonked the bags down at the foot of the spare
bed and one of them, a shopping bag stuffed with clothes, toppled over spilling some of its contents
onto the faded rug. Harry bent down and grabbed a handful of clothes, stuffing them back into the
overly full bag.
As he reached for the last piece of clothing; a soft pink fleecy jumper of Ginny’s he was particularly
fond of, he noticed a white card lying just under the bed. He picked it up and turned it over and
what he saw made his stomach drop. Staring back out at him, smiling lazily was Ginny. She looked
content and happy as she leaned against Dean Thomas’s chest. He was grinning at Ginny with his
arm comfortably around her. It had been taken the day they had played Quidditch at The Burrow.
Seeing her so intimate with another man clawed at his heart. So this is why she had seemed so
cold. He brought his hand up under his glasses, and rubbed his eyes, the ache in him swelling
painfully. He hadn’t noticed them together that day. How long had she been in contact with him
again? He chided himself for being stupid. It was what he wanted, wasn’t it? He’d told her they
could not be together so of course she would move on. And yet he felt ... betrayed.
The hurt in him made him angry and his fists clenched. Just two nights ago on the same day the
photo had been taken she had come to his bed. Is this why she had gone to leave him when he had
denied her? Had she come to him because she could not go to Dean? The thought made him sick.
He had been struggling to let her go but now he had been jolted back to reality. He couldn’t bring
himself to look at the photo again; instead he stuffed it into the bag, covering it with the pink
jumper.
He went back down to the kitchen where Hermione and Ginny were huddled in conversation. Tonks
handed him a cup of tea. When Hermione finally looked up she gave Harry a questioning frown.
Harry was staring at Ginny, watching her stroke Crookshanks who was curled in her lap purring
loudly. Albert was nuzzling into her neck on her shoulder. Barely controlled anger rippled through
him, daring her to look at him. But Ginny did not look up. She went on petting Crookshanks, smiling
- 49 -
at him and talking softly in his ear. Hermione glanced at Ginny then back at Harry again. ‘Is
everything alright, Harry?’
‘Everything’s just fine’ he said, irritated at his own pain. He turned his back on them and added a
spoon a sugar to his cup.
‘Well … that’s all done!’ said Mr. Weasley briskly as he entered the room. ‘Fred and George will be
here later this afternoon. Lupin not back yet?’
‘No’ Harry said leaning back against the bench stirring his tea, he was glad he would have a
distraction when the twins arrived.
‘If he’s not back I think we should postpone it. He will want to be here I’m sure.’
‘Is that really necessary?’ Harry said impatiently.
Mr. Weasley was looking at him with the same inquiring frown as Hermione. ‘Yes, actually. I think it
is.’ He said seriously ‘He is the head of The Order now and should be present at the induction of
three new members.’
Harry looked up ‘Three?’ he said abruptly, looking around at Ron, who had just come in and sat
down at the table 'You don’t mean…’ but he couldn’t finish what he was about to say, he knew how
it would have sounded to Ron and Hermione who were already eyeing him challengingly.
‘No.’ Mr. Weasley answered, following Harry's thoughts. ‘Fred and George are becoming official
members too.’
‘Oh … right’ Harry exhaled with relief.
‘You don’t have to sound so relieved … it wasn’t from lack of trying, believe me!’ said Ron, shooting
a glance at Mr. Weasley.
‘The Order does not accept people who are still at school, Ron.’ Mr. Weasley said sternly ‘Harry will
be our youngest member ever and I doubt there will ever be one as young as him again. His case is
unique, as I’ve explained to you before.’ Ron rolled his eyes.
‘We haven’t got our letters yet’ Hermione chimed in ‘maybe we wont be going to school this year
either.’
‘In that event, you still wont be joining The Order. I am sure there are other things for which you
could be put to use’
‘Like what?’ Ron said defensively
‘We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it!’ Mrs. Weasley had been standing in the doorway
listening. ‘Ginny, has that cat of yours turned up yet?’
‘What cat?’ Ron asked what Harry had been thinking.
‘No, not yet’ Ginny said without looking up, her attention on Albert.
‘What cat?’
‘There’s been a cat hanging around at The Burrow the past few days,’ Mrs. Weasley reached into the
cupboard and pulled out some potatoes ‘We’ve seen it on occasion before but it’s been around a lot
lately,’ She fussed about getting knives out of the draws ‘comes and goes as it pleases, seems to
spend most of it’s time looking for Ginny, at least it’s always in her room. Why she’d want with
another pet, I don’t know.’
‘Why don’t you just boot it out?’ Ron asked
‘Because I’ve adopted it!’ Ginny said angrily ‘and if you harm it in any way I’ll-'
‘Steady on … I wouldn’t do anything to it … I just thought if you wanted rid of it-'
‘Well I don’t! And if it turns up you leave it alone!’ Ginny said, her eyes blazing.
‘Fair enough.’ Ron shrugged ‘What does it look like so I know not to kick it out the door.’ Ginny
scowled at him
‘It’s got rusty coloured long fur’ said Mr. Weasley who had been following the conversation behind
his copy of the Daily Prophet ‘with white patches on it’s face and feet. Quite a young cat I think,
rather smart too.’ He smiled appreciatively ‘It frightened a gnome out of my boot that would have
- 50 -
given me a nasty bite had I of managed to put my foot in it.’
‘Hermione and Ginny, you can give me a hand with lunch.’ Mrs. Weasley had knives chopping
speedily as she poured a sauce into a pan on the stove.
‘I’ll be outside then.’ Tonks appeared to have given up offering her help in the kitchen and she left
to relieve for guard duty.
Harry gulped down his tea and went up to his room, the last thing he wanted to do was eat. He
stood by the window and looked out at the overgrown grass in the front yard. He felt petty and
selfish at his own jealousy. He should’ve been glad for Ginny, she was moving on and doing exactly
as he had asked. But the ache within him would not abate. He was embarrassed to think part of him
had held some hope that she would wait for him ... even pine longingly for him.
He walked over to Hedwig and wincing, reached an arm up for her to sit on. She fluttered down and
blinked at him expectantly. ‘Looks like it’ll always be you and me girl’ he said softly, stroking the
feathers above her beak. He opened the drawer and pushed aside his bloodied t-shirt to get at the
owl treats. Grabbing a handful he sat on the bed and let Hedwig perch on his knee. As he sat
feeding them to her, he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.
Expecting Ron or Hermione coming to get him for lunch he said ‘It’s okay, I’m not hungry!’ The
shadowy figure did not speak as it came to a stop in the doorway. ‘I’ll eat later…’ His voice trailed
off as he saw Ginny standing there watching him. His face immediately changed and he turned back
to Hedwig. ‘I’ll be down later.’ He said gravely, his heart was pounding in his chest as she stepped
into the room.
‘You didn’t even say goodbye’ Her voice was little more than a whisper. ‘At The Burrow … I thought
at least you would say goodbye-'
‘What was the point’ Harry said callously, concentrating on Hedwig ‘you’re here now aren’t you?’ he
wanted to hurt her. He wanted Ginny to know how he felt.
She hesitated for a moment then slowly and uncertainly walked further into the room, running her
hand along the dressing table. As she spoke she sounded reluctant to talk, and Harry found he did
not feel for her.
‘Harry, I need to tell you something…’ She said slowly. He watched her as she paused, her
expression darkening as she looked down at the dresser. With a sudden intake of breath Harry
realized why she had stopped talking. He jumped up, sending Hedwig screeching in a flurry of
feathers back to the top of the wardrobe. Before he could reach the drawer he had sloppily left
open, Ginny had yanked out his t-shirt, her eyes scanning the torn and bloodied marks in horror.
‘What is this?’ she breathed, her brow frowning deeply.
He snatched the top and threw it in the cupboard, slamming it closed angrily. ‘Nothing … it’s
nothing!’
‘Harry, what happened?’ she tried to catch his eye, her voice full of concern. Harry was furious with
himself for being so careless, and he directed his anger onto Ginny.
‘Nothing that concerns you Ginny, so just butt out! This is none of your business!’ his anger had
finally reached boiling point. ‘You’ve got no right to come in here and start asking questions! And
you’d better not repeat what you just saw!’ He flung his arms up and clasped them behind his head
in frustration, ignoring the burning pain from his wounds.
‘Arrrrgh! Why isn’t anything ever easy!’ He closed his eyes for a moment before looking at Ginny,
who was staring wide-eyed at him. He knew this was the perfect moment so he seized it. ‘I’ve
already told you to stay away from me but you keep coming back! Listen to me! Stay out of my
business and out of my life!’ As he said it his body shuddered. Not from rage; he felt like he was
being torn in two.
He breathed heavily, his eyes on the floor waiting to hear her footsteps running from the room. He
had said what he had not been able to bring himself to say until now. He despised himself for his
outburst, so much so that he was not able to look at her. There was a long silence in which she
stood motionless, and then she walked up to him and touched her hand to his face. In spite of
himself he pressed his cheek to her palm, his eyes heavy with the tenderness of her touch.
- 51 -
‘I know what you’re doing’ her green eyes swelled with tears ‘and it only makes me want to be with
you even more.’ and she closed her eyes and kissed him as bittersweet tears spilled onto her
cheeks. He felt sure she had been ready to tell him about Dean, but he did not want to hear it from
her mouth. A mouth that was both so sweet and yet so cruel at the same time. He kissed her
fiercely, punishing her for her betrayal of him. When they pulled apart her lips were red and
swollen.
‘You can’t drive me away, Harry,’ her face was full of sadness, her voice unsteady ‘no matter what
you say. The way I feel ... no one can take that away … not even you.’
Harry scooped her to him again ‘You make me nuts, you know that?' he breathed and this time he
kissed her with all the tenderness of her words. A sad smile crept across her lips as she pulled away
from him.
‘Harry! Ginny! Lunch is on the table!’ Mrs. Weasley yelled up the stairwell to them.
‘We’ll be down in a few minutes!’ Ginny yelled out of the doorway and then went to the draws and
pulled out a fresh t-shirt. Harry frowned, still breathing heavily with passion. He followed her gaze
down at his chest and for the first time he realized his wounds had been bleeding again, the dark
patches of blood had seeped through his bandages and were creeping across his maroon t-shirt.
‘Here’ she said quietly ‘let me help you’ She lifted his t-shirt over his head and redressed his wounds
with bandages she summoned, far better than those Harry had managed to call upon. He was
surprised she knew such magic but she waved it off, attributing it to watching her mother. She did
not ask him any more questions and Harry did not offer her any answers. There was an
understanding between them, one that he could not have trusted to anyone else.
~*~*~*~
Fred and George arrived in the late afternoon carrying a box of test items eventually due for their
store. They settled in for the evening, sharing Ron’s room after a sumptuous roast served up by
Mrs. Weasley.
That night as Harry laid waiting for sleep to take him with his door slightly ajar, he felt something
leap onto the covers by his feet. Crookshanks! He thought, but when he lifted his head to greet him
as it padded up alongside his body, he realized in the moonlight that this cat was much smaller than
Crookshanks, it was also darker in colour though it had delicate white paws that gave the
impression it was wearing socks, and it’s face was also patched with white fur that gave it a definite
feminine appearance.
It looked like Ginny’s cat had turned up after all and as he reached out to pet it, he noticed how soft
and silky it’s fur was. It nuzzled affectionately into his hand making it’s way up to his face, and
purring loudly it settled, laying its head on his pillow with it’s body stretched out below it. Harry
laughed softly.
‘Shouldn’t you be with your mistress? Or has she sent you to keep an eye on me?’ he mused. He
continued playing with its fur and stroking its head as he laid his head back down and before long
he drifted off into a peaceful sleep.
~*~*~*~
The next morning Lupin turned up, and by lunchtime a crowd of Order members had gathered
around the large kitchen table. Mrs. Black had been set off three times as they had arrived banging
on the door or ringing the bell. She had launched into her usual rant, though the moment Ginny had
appeared with her wand drawn she had retreated back into the corner of her painting wailing at the
injustice of it all. Everyone appeared most impressed by her ability to quell Mrs. Black and it was
mentioned in passing jest more than once that she should be added to the list inductees to The
Order.
- 52 -
Once everyone had arrived, Lupin asked all non-members to leave the table and then he called on
Fred, George and Harry to stand.
‘Before we get down to the latest Order business’ Lupin said as he looked around ‘we will swear in
our three new members.’ Lupin looked down to the opposite end of the table where Harry and the
twins stood. He spoke ominously.
‘You should not undertake membership into The Order of The Phoenix lightly.’ He said, looking from
one to the other. ‘If it is adventure and glory you seek then you will not find it here. Being an Order
member is an extremely dangerous and rather thankless job,’ he said seriously ‘if you have any
doubts about joining, you should speak now before we go any further. There is no shame in
admitting that The Order is not for you.’ Harry and the twins stood silently firm.
Lupin sighed gravely ‘Right then, there is a short swearing in first and then we will get on with
business.’ Lupin shuffled through some papers on the table in front of him. Harry looked down at his
feet as he felt something nudge his leg. Ginny’s cat had curled itself around his legs; it’s tail high in
the air. He watched as it sat down partially on his foot and looked up at him with its green eyes. He
smiled at it faintly amused. It had gone by the time he woke in the morning and yet he’d had the
feeling that it had stayed with him all night. He turned his attention back to Lupin.
He was holding a piece of parchment in his hand from which he started reading aloud in the
monotonous tone of someone going through the motions.
‘You will now be asked to swear an oath of allegiance to The Order of The Phoenix. In doing so you
will become privy to all knowledge The Order has already accumulated and you will also be able to
partake in any sharing of new information as it comes to hand. As a member of the secret society
you will be expected as individuals to uphold to the same truths and ideals as The Order itself.’
Harry swallowed; he had a rather uneasy feeling of where this was going.
‘The Order of The Phoenix relies heavily on all of us acting as one,’ Lupin read on, unaware of
Harry’s increasing discomfort ‘and as such, no member is to act alone in matters directly relating to
the business of The Order. As a member you will be required to share any or all information that
may be relevant to our cause of which you either presently or in the future have knowledge of.’
Lupin had said it, exactly that which Harry had feared. Lupin looked over the top of the parchment
at the three of them. ‘Do you understand the terms thus far before we continue?’
‘Yes’ Fred and George said in unison.
Harry stood with a frown on his face; an internal struggle raging within him. He had wanted to join
The Order ever since he knew of its existence, but how could he under the circumstances? As the
long silence stretched out The Order members who had been staring at the table or looking out the
small, high window disinterestedly started to turn their heads to look at him. Harry was eyeing them
all uncomfortably; aware he was backing himself into a corner with his silence.
‘Harry?’ Lupin's tone was one of doubt as he leant his hands on the table in front of him. ‘Do you
have something to say?’ Harry’s mind was racing. Why hadn’t he thought of this? He was
unwittingly full of secrets that he had absolutely no intention of revealing to any of them.
Dumbledore had told him to tell no one other than Ron and Hermione about Voldemort's means of
immortality, and to get to Bellatrix he knew he was going to have to keep Snapes little visit to
himself as well. Harry could not, in good conscience, join them on a lie.
‘I-I’ve changed my mind.’ Harry could think of no other way out of it. ‘I don’t think I’m ready to join
yet.’ He could feel the colour rising in his cheeks. ‘I’d like to think about it, maybe join later like you
said.’ Harry thought the guilt he was feeling was written all over his face. ‘I-I’m sorry … I don’t
mean to waste your time.’ And without looking at them he moved quickly out of the room and
climbed the stairs, leaving a stunned silence behind him.
He went straight on up to his room, not wanting to face anyone. He knew Ron and Hermione would
understand once he explained the situation, after all they too shared the Horcrux secret. But Ginny,
- 53 -
she would think he was a coward and he would not be able to explain.
As he went to close the door behind him, the small red and white cat darted into the closing gap
and ran passed him, jumping onto his bed. Hedwig watched the cat from her perch with interest as
Harry walked over to it, picked it up, and holding it aloft in front of him, sat down.
‘Back again … what’s your name anyway?’ He pulled the cat to his chest and rubbed it affectionately
on the neck. ‘I guess I’m going to have a lot of explaining to do when the meeting is over. I’d better
come up with something good too.’ he said under his breath.
‘What do you think Socks?’ the cat clawed gently up his chest and rubbed it’s head under Harry’s
chin. ‘Lupins never going to understand … and neither is Ginny.’ He said thoughtfully, but then he
was distracted by the fervent purring of Socks as she rubbed herself around Harry’s neck. He lay
back on his arm with her curled into his chest and he spent a long while just stroking her. She rolled
on her back playfully and batted Harry’s hand softly with her front paws as he smiled affectionately
at her. Then there was a knock at the door.
‘Come in.’ Harry sat up and Socks jumped off the bed. Lupin swung the door open and entered, a
grave look on his face, and as he closed the door Socks darted through it and down the stairs.
‘Harry,’ he sounded very serious though Harry could detect no anger in his voice. ‘I want to talk to
you about what happened down stairs.’ Harry waited for it, wondering how he was going to get out
of this convincingly. Lupin sat on the bed next to him ‘I’m sorry we put you in such an awkward
position.’ Harry was thrown by this statement and could think of nothing to say.
‘Arthur and I should have realized that you were too young still. We were carried away with your
past performance and assumed too much.’ Harry sat bewildered ‘Of course you’re not ready to join
The Order, you’ve had enough to deal with without taking on the added responsibility that comes
with belonging to such a society,’ Lupin put his hand on Harry’s shoulder ‘and there was no need to
be embarrassed. Not a single person present in that room thinks any less of you, they are all very
much aware of what you have done in the past.’
Harry finally understood what he was talking about. Lupin and the others had thought his red-faced
silence had been from embarrassment. They actually thought he feared becoming a member of The
Order. Relief wash over him. He wouldn’t have to come up with some half-baked excuse and they
remained clueless as to the real reason why he had backed out.
He gave Lupin the most sheepish look he could muster ‘Yeah … I just didn’t feel ready after all.’
‘That’s quite understandable, Harry.’ Lupin said sincerely.
‘Suppose Fred and George are in?’ he must have overplayed his disappointment because Lupin put
his arm around the back of Harry’s shoulders and joggled him reassuringly.
‘You’ll make it one day Harry, when you’re ready. And I’m willing to bet you’ll be the most
outstanding member The Order has ever seen,’ then Lupin added with a smile ‘besides
Dumbledore.’ Then Lupin lifted himself from the bed and headed for the door. ‘Would you like me to
send Ron and Hermione up?’ Lupin was being rather tactful about Harry’s supposed embarrassment
and although Harry had been glad it had worked out this way, he couldn’t help but feel miffed that
Lupin had believed Harry afraid of joining The Order. But he swallowed his pride.
‘Yeah. Thanks.’
When Ron and Hermione entered the room Harry could see by the look on their faces that Lupin had
told them his version of events. Hermione approached him as she would a sick pigmy puff and Ron
looked just plain uncomfortable. It irritated Harry even more to think his own two best friends would
believe it of him.
‘Are you okay, Harry?’ Hermione sat down next to him and touched his arm reassuringly. Harry
tilted his head at her and gave her a sarcastic look.
‘Before you both start’ he sighed ‘the reason I didn’t join The Order is because you are bound to
reveal all information pertaining to Voldemort that you know, which means that I would have had to
tell them about the Horcruxes, alright? Lupin and the others just assumed I was scared and I didn’t
- 54 -
correct them because it would have led to all sorts of questions that I couldn’t answer!’
‘Oh’ Hermione removed her hand as her cheeks went pink.
‘I knew it had to be something like that!’ Ron sat down on Harry’s other side and grinned at him
‘didn’t believe a word of what Lupin said.’
‘Oh really?’ said Hermione as she raised an eyebrow ‘That’s why you wanted me to come up here on
my own to talk to him first, was it?’
It was Rons turn to turn pink.
‘Look, it doesn’t matter now.’ Harry said ‘We’ve bought some time, so lets spend it going over what
we’ve learned so far about the locket.’
‘Good idea!’ said Hermione shooting Ron a disapproving look ‘Well we’re all in agreement that it
could have been Kreacher who helped Regulus obtain the locket right?’ Ron nodded as Harry picked
up Socks who had wandered into the room again tailing Ron and Hermione. He stood up and carried
her over to the door, pushing it closed, then sat down on the rug and placed Socks in the crook of
his crossed legs.
‘It’s the best theory we’ve got to go on’ he said ‘so I guess the next step is to question Kreacher’
‘That’ll be a delightful treat.’ Said Ron flatly.
‘If he was with Regulus when he obtained the Horcrux he may be able to tell us what happened to
it.’ Hermione was looking curiously at Socks. ‘Is that Ginny’s cat?’
‘Yeah’ said Harry ‘so … I suppose I’d better call him then.’ He said reluctantly.
‘What’s its name?’
‘What? Oh … I don’t know, I’ve been calling her Socks, she seems to like it.’ She was purring loudly
and had her eyes squished together enjoying Harry’s attention.
‘Do you think he’ll come?’ Ron asked obviously hopeful the answer would be no.
Harry shrugged ‘He’s come when I’ve called before.’
‘He has to come. Give him a call!' Hermione said.
All three of them were silent for a moment, Ron had raised his eyebrow in anticipation while
Hermione grimaced and Harry was looking at them both with a wry smile. He rose off the floor and
looked up at the air in front of him and called ‘Kreacher!’
CRACK!
At first Harry couldn’t quite work out what he was looking at, it appeared to be a house elf but it
had too many arms and legs.
‘He calls me!’ it croaked ‘the mudblood lover calls me to him, in my Mistresses home no less.
Kreacher will go and speak with his Mistress, yes-’
‘Harry Potter is your master and Dobby is loyal, even if nasty Kreacher is not!’ another voice
squeaked.
‘Dobby? … What’s going on? What are you doing here?’ Harry was standing with Socks perched on
his foot looking down in puzzlement.
It appeared that Kreacher and Dobby were stuck together, though how Harry couldn’t tell.
8. Kreacher’s Mischief and Ministry Woes
It was a most peculiar sight.
Kreacher and Dobby were standing back to back and did not seem able to put any distance between
each other, rather like they had been glued together.
‘Harry Potter! Dobby is most pleased to see you.’ Dobby squeaked enthusiastically and immediately
- 55 -
went into a low bow. Kreacher, on the other hand, was somewhat less than awed at the site of
Harry and looked extremely disgruntled as he resigned himself to being dragged off his feet onto
Dobby’s back with his legs dangling in the air in front of him.
‘What happened?’ Hermione seemed more than a little distressed at their predicament. ‘How long
have you been like this?’
‘The mudblood speaks to Kreacher!’ Wide-eyed and faking shock, Kreacher placed his long bony
fingers in his ears. ‘The Mistress will see, oh yes, she will see her Kreacher does not listen to it.’ his
crooked legs still splayed in the air.
‘How did you two get stuck together then?’ Ron asked as if he were talking to a couple of
misbehaving children.
‘Dobby, what’s going on?’ Harry said getting a little frustrated.
‘Dobby is trying to protect Harry Potter’ Dobby straightened defiantly, letting Kreacher’s feet touch
the floor once more. ‘Dobby is seeing Kreacher sneaking, so Dobby is binding us to make Dobby go
where Kreacher goes.’
‘Stupid elf with funny hats knows not what he is doing!' Kreacher said loudly to himself ‘Kreacher
will find a way to break stupid elf’s bond.’
‘What do you mean, sneaking?’ Harry frowned, eyeing Kreacher.
‘Dobby knows Kreacher is up to mischief!’ Dobby turned his head awkwardly to look at Kreacher
through narrowed eyes ‘Kreacher is going to betray his master, Dobby knows HE IS A BAD ELF!’ his
voice getting angrier with every word.
‘What are you talking about?’
‘Master knows Kreacher cannot disobey him.’ Kreacher interrupted slyly, still facing in the opposite
direction. ‘Kreacher is doing as Master ordered.’
‘Dobby, you can’t stay stuck together like this!’ Hermione sounded exasperated. ‘You’ll have to undo
the spell!’ she said as she crossed her arms.
Harry was trying to walk around Dobby to get to Kreacher but the little elf kept shuffling around
enthusiastically so he remained facing Harry, eventually Harry grabbed his bony little arm to make
him stay put and crouched down in front of Kreacher. Harry looked into his bloodshot grey eyes.
‘What have you been up to?’ he said suspiciously.
Kreacher seemed rather pleased with Harry’s reaction. ‘Kreacher is only following his Masters
orders.’ His continual emphasis on the word Master glowed with contempt.
Harry narrowed his eyes ‘What did I tell you to do?’ he asked slowly.
‘Master cannot remember his own orders? Kreacher is indeed unfortunate to serve under such a
lowly wizard!’
Harry clenched his jaw as Ron and Hermione looked on in anxious silence. ‘What-did-I-tell-you-to-
do, Kreacher?’
Kreacher bowed dramatically, leaving Dobby flailing as his legs left the floor. ‘You had Kreacher
follow the brave and daring Master Malfoy.’ he said treacherously.
There was a sudden knock at the door and Harry, Ron and Hermione looked up sharply. ‘Just a
minute’ Harry threw at the door urgently as he stood up. Socks scattered and jumped onto the bed.
‘You’re both going to have to leave,’ Harry said quietly, but before he could finish the door flung
open and Fred and George stepped into the room.
‘Told you!’ Fred said triumphantly, pointing at the two elves now struggling with each other to get
the best view of the doorway. ‘Knew he wouldn’t disappoint us.’
‘What are you doing?’ Harry was angry at having been caught.
‘Didn’t honestly expect us to believe that tripe you told Lupin, did you?’ George raised his eyebrows
‘Not ready to join The Order! Pull the other one!’
- 56 -
‘This, coming from the kid who swiped an egg from a brooding Horntail.’ Fred chimed in.
‘And destroyed a Basilisk to rescue our little sister.’
‘Not to mention the Death Eaters-'
‘Alright!’ Harry said impatiently ‘so you caught me. Suppose now you’re bound tell the rest of them.’
‘Don’t be daft!’
‘What ever you’ve got going on, if it’s important enough to stop you from joining The Order, then
we’re not going to tell them.’ George said.
‘Right! However we do want in on it.’ Fred said unabashedly.
‘Absolutely. Anyway they made it quite clear in the meeting that we were not going to be allowed
out in the field as Order members…’
‘So basically we now hold the unofficial title of Order mascots.’
‘Which is not what we signed up for, is it?’ George swept into the room and crouched in front of the
elves, studying them curiously. ‘What happened to these two?’
‘They’re stuck together’ said Ron flatly.
‘Leave it to you to state the bleedin obvious’ Fred walked over to Kreacher and pointed his wand at
the elf. There was a flash of white light and a whooshing sound, and then Dobby and Kreacher
broke apart scowling at one another.
‘Well that’s that! So what’s going on then?’ George said as he stood and faced Harry.
The trio exchanged looks before Harry slowly spoke ‘Kreacher has been following Malfoy.’
‘What?’ Fred looked flummoxed as he looked back at Kreacher.
‘Well … where is the little toe rag?’ asked George.
‘I don’t know, I was just about to ask before you came in.’
‘Don’t let us stop you.’ Fred ushered Kreacher over to Harry. Harry felt it was a reasonable trade-off
involving Fred and George in the news about Malfoy rather than giving them the real reason he had
called Kreacher.
‘Well Kreacher?’ Harry said expectantly ‘Where is he?’
‘Kreacher cannot say.’ the wrinkly little elf bowed extravagantly once more. ‘Kreacher has been
unable to follow the noble and handsome Draco all the way to his location.’
‘The what?’ George said dubiously.
‘Never mind,’ said Harry with a sigh, and then turning back to Kreacher he asked ‘why?’
Kreacher lifted his head smugly ‘because the stupid elf with clothes will not let me.’
Fred caught Dobby’s arm as he tried to throw himself at Kreacher. ‘Dobby is not stupid!’ he
squawked angrily, arms flailing madly. ‘Kreacher cannot be trusted! Kreacher is a bad house elf!’
‘Hang on, so have been following him or not?’ Ron was looking extremely confused.
‘Kreacher humbly follows in Draco's aristocratic wake when he is at Hogwarts.’
‘Hogwarts?’ Fred, George and Ron said in unison.
‘Are you telling me that Draco is wandering around the school undetected … whenever he feels like
it?’ Harry said doubtfully
‘Kreacher did not say that.’ he smiled slyly.
‘Then tell me what he is doing there!’ Harry said losing his patience with Kreacher. ‘And I want you
to be specific! How often … and which rooms he goes to!’
‘Master is cunning.’ Kreacher’s smug expression dissolved as he realized his game of verbal cat and
mouse was over. ‘Kreacher has been privileged to watch the dashing young Malfoy twice as he has
made his way into the Headmasters office’
‘He’s been inside Dumbledore’s office?’ Hermione said as she stepped forward. Kreacher covered his
ears to block her out but before he could say anything insulting Hermione leant down and yanked
his arms away from the side of his head in frustration, her enormous patience with Kreacher had
finally worn thin. ‘What was he doing in there?’ she demanded.
- 57 -
‘The mudblood touched Kreacher-'
‘What was he doing in there?’ Hermiones eyes blazed. Kreacher still did not acknowledge her.
‘ANSWER HER!’ Harry commanded furiously.
‘He spoke with one of the portraits.’ Kreacher bit back defeated and then with a CRACK he was
gone.
‘Dobby! Will you keep an eye on him for me? Don’t try to stop him but watch him okay?’
‘Dobby would be proud to do as you ask, Harry Potter!’ Dobby answered, lifting his head to its full
height, and with a CRACK he was gone too.
‘What’s all that noise up there?’ Mrs. Weasleys voice echoed through the door.
‘Just showing Harry one of our new Lung Buster Bubblegums!’ Fred opened it a crack and yelled
back as Socks darted through and down the stairs, apparently scared off by all the noise.
‘For goodness sake! I’ve told you about chewing those in the house!’ she yelled back ‘All of you can
come on down anyway. I’m serving up an early dinner now everyone’s gone.’
They didn’t get a chance to discuss any further the bombshell that Draco had been back to
Hogwarts over the holidays. Lupin had left and Mr. Weasley was leaving on an assignment for the
ministry the next morning and Mrs. Weasley insisted they spend the remaining time together as a
family. She ignored the twin’s obvious annoyance, mistakenly putting it down to their
disappointment at not being asked to play an active roll in The Order.
Harry was distracted by the fact that he hadn’t gotten around to asking Kreacher about the locket,
and spent most of the evening in deep thought, offering a grunt in answer here and there when it
was expected of him. Ron and Hermione valiantly tried several times to excuse themselves early in
the hopes they could congregate in private somewhere else in the house, but Mrs. Weasley was
having none of it. She was unusually determined to keep them all together.
When it was finally late enough to get away with it, Ginny announced her intentions to retire and
brushed past Harry on her way up to bed. It seemed to him she had come unnecessarily close and it
jolted him out of his state of self-imposed isolation, awakening in him that familiar need that only
she could arouse, and only she could fill.
Yet instead of finding it a pleasant sensation Harry found it frustrating; he could not seek the
fulfilment he so desperately craved and so when he finally retired to his own room he lay awake for
what seemed like hours, his body tense and his mind a mess of images and emotions. Eventually he
was wound up so tightly, he gave up on sleep and threw on his jeans. He sat on the bed and leaned
himself on the window ledge, looking out at the frosted bluish light illuminating the street.
~*~*~*~
Harry was gently roused by the smooth touch of warm hands on his bare shoulders.
The cool evening breeze drifted through the open space in the window as he lifted his head slowly
from the crook of his arm on the windowsill. He closed his eyes again as he felt Ginny’s soft lips on
his neck. He wanted to lose himself in her, he wanted to bury his frustration and unleash the
passion that ebbed through him. She let her hands find their way to his and he clasped them
tightly, holding onto the feel of her body as she pressed it against his back.
‘Don’t turn me away again.’ she whispered in his ear. An incredible ache racked through his body at
her words, awakening a desire he could not control. He turned as he pulled her to him. Their lips
met in a flare of passion, her breathing as ragged as his, her desire as complete. He eased her back
on the bed as she bit at his bottom lip playfully, her hushed throaty laugh clearing his mind of
everything except her.
Every nerve in him felt alive with her touch, and as he brought his body down on hers, she
shuddered slightly, wrapping her hands around the back of his neck and kissing him longingly. Their
lips were locked together as Harry swam in her caresses but a thought was growing in the back of
- 58 -
his mind. He tried to shut it out, increasing the pressure of his lips on hers, pressing his eyes tightly
shut, but it refused to be denied.
Harry let out a low rumble in the back of his throat as he pulled his head up. He could see Ginny’s
glistening eyes in the moonlight as she tilted her head and frowned slightly, but Harry knew she
was expecting him to pull away. He looked painfully into her eyes, wondering if she could
understand. He could not voice the thought that had brought him to a grinding halt. He could not
speak the words that lingered in his mind. But he would act on them because they could not be
ignored.
Slowly Ginny sat up as Harry moved his body off her and made way for her to leave him, as he
knew she would. She looked down at the bed covers unable to meet his gaze.
‘I want to stay with you anyway,’ her voice broke as the tears spilled down her cheeks. ‘I don’t care
anymore’ Harry lifted her chin gently ‘I don’t want to leave you.’
Harry wrapped his protective arms around her and held her to him as she wept silently, and finally
when she was ready to return to her own bed, he kissed her tenderly, memorizing every curve of
her lips.
~*~*~*~
Their letters arrived a few days later and Harry felt some relief that Hogwarts would be reopening
again this year. Now he knew Malfoy had been back to the castle he felt the overwhelming need to
return there as well.
In the final weeks before school Ginny did not appear in Harry’s room in the middle of the night. It
was not as if there was no longer anything between them, but finally she seemed to accept Harry’s
choice to let her go, though he had to remind himself nightly why he had chosen to do so. Instead,
Socks had kept him company most nights. She seemed to have adopted him, and Harry was
becoming very attached to her, in fact some nights he found himself waiting to feel her familiar
spring onto the bed and warm body curled against his before he would drift into a peaceful sleep.
She was rarely about during the day though, and when he asked, Ginny had waved it off saying
Socks was usually to be found in some nook of the house sleeping. Harry wondered vaguely at how
much a cat could sleep.
Crookshanks appeared to pay no mind to Socks one way or the other, seemingly thoroughly
uninterested when she padded into the room. On occasion Harry would discover her skulking around
when he was alone with Ron and Hermione, and he would pick her up and play with her while
thinking on what they would do next. Though for some reason Hermione seemed to be growing
increasingly uncomfortable as she studied Harry toying with his playmate, eventually taking to
searching the room and upon finding Socks, she would unceremoniously dump her outside the door
before they were allowed to discuss anything, much to Harry’s, and Socks’s annoyance.
During their talks they had agreed that it was too risky to summon Kreacher back to Grimmauld
Place. The disturbance that inevitably followed when he and Dobby were in a room together was
much harder to explain away now that Fred and George had gone, so it was decided that Harry
would wait until he was at Hogwarts to question him about the locket.
The day finally came for the trip to Diagon Alley for the years school supplies. With the growing
threat from Voldemort's minions, and the fact that many students were not expected to return to
school after the summer, McGonagall had arranged a day for the students and family’s to visit
Diagon Alley in relative safety to pick up their supplies while under the protection of the ministry
aurors.
Mr. Weasley mused that the ministry was very keen to catch up with Harry after he had slipped
through their grasp at The Burrow, returning to Grimmauld Place. Apparently Scrimgeour had
launched into a red-faced rant when he had found out they had lost Harry, with Mr. Weasley himself
coming under fire being accused of aiding and abetting Harry’s "escape", but Mr. Weasley was able
to confidently state that he was in no way able to tell the ministry where Harry was. This was of
- 59 -
course absolutely true as he was not the Orders secretkeeper.
For the first time, they were going to apparate into Diagon Alley as it seemed the quickest and
safest way to travel now that they all had their licenses, except of course Ginny, who was extremely
put out that she was going to be left behind.
‘You don’t need new robes Ginny, you’ve barely grown in size over the past year!’ was all Mrs.
Weasley would offer in way of comfort. Harry had immediately asked who was staying behind to
guard her and Lupin had looked at him curiously, clear he hadn’t thought it necessary. But the last
thing Harry wanted was for Snape to pay a little visit while they were gone and find Ginny alone.
Without voicing his real reasons why, Harry managed to convince Lupin that just because he wasn’t
there, didn’t mean she wasn’t in any danger, and under the helpful growingly indignant gaze of Mrs.
Weasley, Lupin assigned Hestia to stay behind.
Sturgis and Tonks were gathered in the kitchen having already been enlisted for added protection,
but they were not travelling with the Weasleys, rather they would go ahead first with Lupin, one at
a time and position themselves so they could watch from a distance. Lupin seemed to think that an
obvious presence of so many Order members gathered around the Weasleys would be akin to
holding up a rather large neon sign saying HARRY POTTER IS HERE with a giant finger pointed at
him. So it was that Lupin and the others left the kitchen with a series of loud cracks, followed a
while later by Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Harry and Hermione.
Harry was disappointed to note that Diagon Alley had become decidedly unfriendly over the past
year. More shops than ever were closed and boarded up, and the little stalls that had sprung up
were increasingly poorly erected and manned.
‘Alright, we’ll get you three fitted out for new uniforms, you don’t need to buy robes; the ones you
have should last you.’ Mrs. Weasley said as her eyes darted around her ‘Harry, where are you dear?’
she added quietly.
‘Here’ he said as he moved to stand near her elbow. Lupin had taken Harry aside before they left
and insisted he wear his invisibility cloak the whole time they were out, also advising him not to
make contact with any friends he might come across in case someone was watching. Harry thought
it strange but it seemed he was almost as worried about the aurors discovering Harry’s presence as
he was of Voldemorts cronies.
‘Good. Stay right by us … don’t go wandering off or we’ll lose you!’
As they moved along the street, the occasional huddle of people emerged from one of the few open
stores. Harry noted that few of the students would have been below fourth year and he guessed
that most of the young ones were being kept at home. Scowling at the enormity of impact
Voldemort had on the wizarding community Harry had embraced so enthusiastically when he had
been introduced to it, he made his way down the cobbled Alley.
What was once a warm and welcoming place had been reduced to a foreboding ghost town where
the once happy and lively throng of people had become a trickle of frightened witches and wizards
who constantly glanced over their shoulders. Harry couldn’t stop the anger in him as it rose with
every passing step. One maniac had been responsible for all of this. A madman who had become
less than human in his effort to avoid death was bringing the world that Harry loved to it’s knees.
They shuffled in the door of Madame Malkin’s and were loaded up with new jumpers and shirts in no
time. Once Mrs. Weasley had parted with several Galleons they headed to Flourish and Blotts, which
must have closed since their previous visit but appeared to have been opened specially for the
occasion. The windows were still boarded up making the interior very dank indeed, and dust that
had been kicked up by billowing cloaks drifted in the suns rays that had pierced the cracks between
the planks of wood.
Harry stood near the stairwell trying to avoid bumping into anyone, and as he scrambled back to
make way for two of the youngest students he had yet seen, he brushed a stack of disused books
and dust swirled up under the confines of his cloak and attacked his mouth and nose.
He sneezed loudly three times in rapid succession and as he looked up, eyes watering madly, Mr.
- 60 -
and Mrs. Weasley, Hermione and Ron all stood gawping at the space where Harry was standing, and
they were not the only ones. Nearby witches and wizards had stopped in mid act of rifling through
books, automatically grabbing their children and staring wide-eyed at the non-apparent source of
noise.
‘Hehe… well now …’ Mr. Weasley recovered first. ‘Ron, I told you not to bring your rat in here,’ Mr.
Weasley was a terrible liar. Nervously he turned to the increasing hub of people watching ‘gets
terribly allergic … very old you see … Mmm…’ he added lamely.
‘Right’ said Ron unconvincingly, then gaining confidence in the excuse he looked over his shoulder
‘Sorry …’ and bent down in mock search ‘I’ll just get him.’ and proceeded to lift up books and peer
round shelves as people started looking away again.
‘That was too close!’ Harry said under his breath as Ron reached him, though he noted that one or
two wizards looked thoroughly unconvinced.
‘Yeah, I think you might be better to wait outside.’ Ron said as he continued to half-heartedly look
for his non-existent rat.
‘I think you’re right’ and Harry headed past him, making his way to the door. He dodged around it
before it closed shut and stood in the street waiting for the others.
He watched as people approached and hurried on down the street, wondering why he hadn’t spotted
any aurors yet. Maybe they were all hidden under cloaks like he was, but he doubted it as he was
pretty sure they didn’t have that many invisibility cloaks at their disposal. He started searching
more earnestly for some sign of them, looking in the tiny darkened alleys between shops and even
scanning the rooftops as he walked slowly around in a circle. Suddenly he was knocked off his feet
and he hit the ground with a thud, his cloak underneath him and something lying on top of him.
‘Neville!’ he croaked as he tried to heave his friend off him.
Neville looked startled as he scrambled to pick himself up, eyeing Harry apologetically ‘Sorry Harry!
Didn’t see you there…’
‘Yes, well that was the whole point’ said Harry exasperated, pulling himself off the ground looking at
Neville’s anguished face.
‘I’m really sorry, Harry!’
‘It wasn’t your fault, I wasn’t watching where I was going’ he added, swinging his cloak over his
head. But before he could cover himself with it, it was ripped from his hands and he was being
thrust face first to the ground. ‘GET OFF!’ he yelled as he struggled to get his hands free. He could
hear Neville’s urgently high voice.
‘Let Go!’
Harry, his heart pounding, squirmed under the body that was pressing down on him. He managed
to twist onto his back and finally pulled his hands free. Automatically his left fist made contact with
his assailants face and his right had found his wand. ‘Levicorpus!’ With lightening speed he had
raised the man off him and dangled him in the air by his ankle.
‘Give me that…’ An angry voice said and Harry spun onto his knees.
‘Stupefy!’ he shot at a wizard who was struggling with Neville’s wand hand, trying to disarm him.
The flash of light hit the man’s chest and his eyes curled backwards into his head as he was thrown
off his feet by the force of the curse.
Then several things happened all at once.
A woman who was coming out of Flourish and Blotts started screaming, battling her way back
against people who pushed forward out the doors to see what was happening; the man who dangled
in the air was spluttering threateningly at Harry as blood dripped from his nose; and many loud
CRACKS resounded in the street around Harry and Neville signifying the arrival of a number of
apparators.
Harry, who was spinning around on his feet, wand directed straight out in front of him looking for
- 61 -
someone to target, suddenly threw himself at Neville, and pushed him to the ground as several jets
of red light soared past them. He aimed a curse at one of the wizards that now surrounded him as
he scrambled to his feet, but he felt a white hot jolt in his back that threw him forward. His body
skidded along the ground but he still had his wand arm free. Impedimenta!
Without speaking as he struggled to catch his breath after being winded, he sent a curse that
caught the man approaching him off guard, his body stiffening. Harry groggily picked himself up, his
eyes watering from the pain, trying desperately to locate Neville and see if he was all right, but
before he could straighten his body two blasts pelted excruciatingly into his side, hurling him off his
feet, his head hitting the cobbled stones with a sickening crunch.
Harry heard Lupins voice roaring furiously ... he felt the breath leave his lungs and then everything
went black…
~*~*~*~
Harry’s body felt stiff and sore when he finally opened his eyes. His head swam as he tried to sit up,
everything blurred and the pain shot through his skull so he let his head drop back down onto the
thin pillow. He kept his eyes closed as nausea threatened to overcome him. What happened?
He tried but he couldn’t remember what had brought him to this point. As he clutched his head he
felt a lumpy wet patch above his left eye, he pulled his hand away and squinted at it, the blurry
image of his fingers was smeared with blood. That explained why his head was spinning at least.
But why wasn’t it bandaged? Why hadn’t someone fixed it already?
A sense of urgency grew in him. Something was terribly wrong. With his eyes only half open and his
head feeling like it was splitting in two, Harry slowly eased himself off the bed onto his feet. Nausea
swept through him again as the blood left his head, and the darkness that had barely retreated
closed in on him. He staggered briefly, unable to focus on the anything to stop the spinning, his
head feeling like it would explode, but even as he fought the urge to throw up, he dropped to the
floor and sank into oblivion.
~*~*~*~
Something was lifting him up; strong hands were dragging him as he tried to open his eyes but his
head pounded so much that he felt sick. He could hear voices but they seemed very distant and he
could not make out what they were saying. He was hoisted into a sitting position on a soft platform;
his head feeling like his skull was crushing in on him as someone tapped his face.
‘Harry! Harry wakeup! Wakeup Harry!’ it echoed in his head painfully and suddenly he convulsed,
throwing his chest forward he lost the contents of his stomach. There were angry voices as Harry’s
body went limp again; being held up only by arms clutching at his shoulders. He felt so incredibly
tired and the pain in his head was so severe that he wished these people would just let him sleep.
There was an argument raging somewhere in the room as Harry hung his head and waited to
blackout again. ‘Harry! Wakeup!’ that annoying voice said again as he felt a hand tapping his cheek
‘Harry! Don’t fall asleep!’ but even as the voice spoke, Harry willed the approaching darkness to
take him away.
Then someone put a hand under his chin and held his head up, something was thrust against his
lips and hot liquid dripped out of the sides of his mouth and down the back of his throat as he
spluttered and choked on it..
The drowsiness that had lurked comfortably near was ebbing away rapidly and the pounding in his
head grew more and more real until he felt like he could bear it no longer. He swiped out at the cup
and heard it crash to the ground.
‘It’s alright Harry … it will help you to stay awake’
- 62 -
‘I don’t want to stay awake’ he croaked still unable to open his eyes for the pain.
‘I know,’ the voice softened ‘Someone’s coming to fix you Harry … but you need to stay awake until
they get here’ Harry groaned in protest. ‘It wont be long … I promise…’
Harry realized who was talking to him ‘Lupin?’ he still could not open his eyes or hold his head up to
see.
‘Yes’
Harry wanted to talk to him, he wanted to ask what had happened and how he came to be here, but
the pounding in his head was becoming all consuming. ‘I need to lay down’
‘It should be alright, he’s had the potion so he wont lose consciousness.’ Tonks’s voice sounded
strained. He felt himself being lowered and once his head was on the pillow some of the thunderous
pain eased. Harry tried to open his eyes but immediately felt sick again as the light swirled above
him, so he closed them and lay there listening.
‘They should have Scrimgeour’s head on a stick for this!’ Tonks sounded extremely angry. ‘I
wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it for myself.’
‘He shouldn’t have attacked us’ a male voice Harry vaguely recognized replied
‘What did you expect?’ Tonks’s said so loudly that Harry closed his arms over his face to try to quell
the noise ‘I mean honestly … what did you think he would do … creeping up behind him and
wrestling him to the ground … your lucky all he did was hang you upside down!’
‘Tonks!’ Lupin butted in. Harry’s memory of the incident was starting to come back to him.
‘Neville’ he groaned ‘Is he-'
‘fine, he’s just fine’ Lupin said soothingly.
A short time later a woman arrived and after a brisk greeting Harry felt her slender hands on his
face. ‘Why wasn’t this seen to straight away?’ she said gravely.
‘These idiots wouldn't let us in to see him!’ Tonks said ‘He was lying on the floor when we came in.’
she said darkly
‘Totally unacceptable! I will be lodging a formal complaint with the Ministry the minute I get back to
St Mungos!’ the woman said business like as she took her hands from Harry. He felt a gentle
warmth on his forehead that gradually grew into an uncomfortable prickly heat, but the pounding in
his head was slowly receding until it was no more than a dull ache.
Eventually the sensation stopped and the woman told Harry to open his eyes. He opened them
cautiously and was pleasantly surprised to note that everything had finally stopped spinning, though
he still couldn’t focus on anything.
‘How’s that … better?’ she asked him. He lifted himself onto his elbow and turned to look at her as
something was thrust into his hand. That’s why he still couldn’t focus, he thought as he slid his
glasses over his nose. The room and the people in it swayed gently, but it was not enough to make
him feel sick.
‘Yeah, much better. Thanks.’ She nodded at him satisfied and instructed him to stay in bed until
morning.
Lupin followed her and spoke to her quietly outside the room as she left, before coming back and
sitting down on the edge of Harry’s bed. The man Harry now recognized as the one he had punched
on the nose and hung upside down in Diagon Alley, was standing just inside the doorway, studying
the three of them nervously. Over his shoulder hovered a small black orb. Harry looked away in
disgust. Scrimgeour had sent the Stalker to keep an eye on them, was he so afraid of what they
might do? The cold room was bare except for the bed he now sat on and a small table that was
propped against a pale green wall.
‘You’re in one of the ministry’s holding cells’ Lupin said watching him.
Harry gave Lupin a stony look ‘Are they going to let me out?’
‘They can’t keep you here, Harry.’ Lupin said ‘If people find out the ministry’s holding the "Chosen
One" in their jail cells there will be a massive outcry, Scrimgeour can be sure of that.’ He said as he
looked over at the Stalker ‘But as you are not well enough to be moved, you’ll stay here for the
night anyway-'
- 63 -
‘No’ Harry cut him off ‘I feel fine and I want out of here!’
Lupin looked down at the floor gravely ‘Harry, I don’t think you realize how close you came to-'
‘I’m fine now.’ Harry abruptly.
‘I can understand why he doesn’t want to stay’ Tonks said with a raised eyebrow. Lupin gave him an
appraising look.
‘You’d have to walk all the way to the Atrium before we can leave Harry.’
‘Not a problem.’ Harry felt weak but his need to leave here was greater.
‘We’re in the furthest part of the ministry’ Lupin added.
‘Doesn’t matter.’
‘Molly will be relieved to see him’ Tonks added.
‘You’d have to go straight to your own bed when we got back’ Lupin said.
‘Happily.’ Harry sounded anything but happy.
‘See, we just need to decide how are we going to take him’ Tonks said confidently.
‘I suppose we could go via the floo, I don’t think you’re up to
apparating.’
‘Fine’ said Harry.
‘All right’ Lupin said resignedly, standing up ‘I’ll go and speak to Scrimgeour. I’ll be back soon.’ and
he turned and left, Tonks smiling after him.
‘I’ll head back to let them know you’re coming, Harry’ she said and followed him out the door.
Harry had found the walk to the Atrium much more tiresome than he had expected. By the time he
stepped into the kitchen at Grimmauld place after the whirling trip through the floo network, his
head was hurting so much he was wincing with the pain again. But he was glad to be back.
Hermione and Mrs. Weasley were looking at him in shock but they both gave him overly tight hugs
before Mrs. Weasley sent him straight upstairs with watery eyes. Ron looked extraordinarily pale as
he accompanied Harry up to his room. Harry sat on the bed with his head in his hands. It was
feeling like it might burst at any minute so Ron closed the curtains and then left, closing the door
behind him.
‘You’ve got an interesting relationship with the ministry, haven’t you?’
Harry looked up in surprise. Ginny was walking towards him with a crooked smile on her face.
‘Where’d you come from?’
‘I was waiting for you’ she said as she sat beside him and lifted her hand to his forehead to inspect
the damage. Harry hadn’t seen her when he came in. He was about to mention the fact when Ginny
spoke again.
‘It doesn’t look too bad now,’ she dropped her eyes to his ‘though from what Hermione said, you
were in pretty bad shape for a while.’
‘How would she know?’
‘Tonks told her they found you on the floor, lying unconscious in a pool of blood.’ Ginny was
frowning slightly as she stood up looking at his shirt. For the first time Harry noticed the dark patch
of dried blood on the shoulder. So that explained why Mrs. Weasley and Hermione had looked so
shocked and the blood had drained from Ron's face.
‘Here’ Ginny handed Harry the basin which normally sat below the mirror. He rested it on his knees
as she dipped the small towel in and wiped the dried blood from his face and neck. As he sat there
enjoying the sensation of Ginny’s touch he thought how he could have used the Tergeo charm to
remove the blood, but he found this way much more pleasant so he allowed Ginny to clean him up
and strip him of his old shirt, replacing it with a black t-shirt she had once told him suited him very
much. Then she told him to lye down and promptly left him before Mrs. Weasley brought in a tray of
dinner.
She showed some surprise at Harry’s cleaned up appearance but said nothing before telling him she
- 64 -
would bring him up a light sleeping draught later. Even though Harry’s head still ached, he was
rather hungry so he finished off the steak and kidney pie before placing the tray on the floor, and
then leaned back on his stack of pillows feeling very thankful he wasn’t in the cell at the ministry.
It may have been paranoia about Death Eaters that had triggered off the events that led him to the
ministry cells, but what other reaction did they expect? You don't grab someone from behind and
throw them on the ground unless you're expecting a fight! What were they playing at? There was a
knock at the door and Lupin entered.
‘You’re looking better.’
‘What happened? Why did they jump me in the first place?’ was out of Harry’s mouth before he had
even sat up properly.
‘Because they’re idiots.’ said Tonks as she appeared from behind Lupin.
Lupin couldn’t help but smile ‘Yes, well … that does certainly seem to play a part in all this.’ then he
pulled up a chair as Tonks plonked herself down on Harry’s bed.
‘Starring role if you ask me.’ she looked sideways at Harry.
‘They were under orders to detain you if they found you, Kingsley warned me yesterday.’ Lupin
sighed.
‘What? Why?’ Harry said, feeling his temper rise.
‘Since the ministry lost contact with you they have been under a barrage of public pressure to …
produce you.’ Harry looked at Lupin in angry bewilderment ‘It didn’t take long for the rumours to
start that you were not missing … but dead.’
‘Stupid gits almost killed you trying to prove you were alive!’ Tonks rolled her eyes.
‘So they watched for you at Diagon Alley and when Neville knocked you over and your cloak came
off, the two closest aurors moved in. They tried to stop you from putting your cloak back on, and
the scuffle that ensued brought the rest of them down on top of you.’ Lupin said gravely.
‘So they thought that the best thing to do would be to leave me to rot in one of their cells?’ Harry
said through his teeth.
‘Prats!’ said Tonks.
‘They’re afraid of you Harry,’ Lupin said quietly. Harry scoffed as Lupin went on to explain ‘they
never expected you to be so … hard to detain. They had no idea how skilled you are, so when they
realized they had nearly killed you trying to defend themselves, they panicked. They got you back
to the ministry and in the holding cell before I could see how much damage they had done.’
‘Arrrgh! I am so sick of it!’ Harry didn’t try to hide his fury ‘If Scrimgeour gets in my way one more
time I’m gonna-'
‘I don’t think that will be a problem anymore.’ Lupin interrupted.
‘Why should he stop now? He doesn’t strike me as the type to give up that easily.’ Harry said
resentfully.
‘Because you have him over a barrel, Harry. If you were to tell people what happened he wouldn’t
last ten more minutes in his office.’ Lupin stood up ‘Imagine the Minister of Magic almost doing
Voldemort's job for him.’ a sad smile played across his lips.
After they left Harry thought about what was said. He hoped Lupin had been right and that it would
be the end of the Ministries interference. He would be heading back to Hogwarts the day after
tomorrow and he had no idea what was in store for him after that. The last thing he needed was the
Ministry trying to track him down wherever he went.
His head still ached and there was a dull ringing in his ears from the pain when Mrs. Weasley came
in briefly to give Harry a sleeping draft, not leaving until he had drank it all down. He really didn’t
mind having some help to shut out the pain, and it wasn’t long before he was feeling very light
headed indeed.
Eventually the draft seeped through him and he could feel no pain at all, so he closed his eyes and
enjoyed drifting lightly between states of consciousness. He felt something hop on his bed and he
immediately grinned, thinking that Socks had come to keep him company yet again. But when he
opened his eyes Ginny was sat on the side of his bed looking down at him, smiling.
‘What are you grinning at?’ she laughed playfully.
- 65 -
‘You’ he said with an even broader smile.
‘Really!’ her eyes sparkled.
‘I’d take you over Socks any day.’ he felt blissfully intoxicated as he reached his hand up and
brushed her hair back off her face.
‘Is that so?’ she chuckled.
‘Yeah, but don’t tell her I said that.’ he said softly.
‘Oh, somehow I don’t think she’d mind.’
Harry gazed up at the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. ‘I’m going to marry you one day,
Ginny Weasley.’
‘You fool,’ she laughed softly ‘it’s the potion mum gave you, your completely out of your head.’
‘And what a wonderful place it is,’ he said dreamily.
Ginny’s smile saddened slightly as she looked down at his mouth ‘It’ll be over one day Harry,’ her
finger brushed across his lips as he opened them to kiss it gently ‘one day you’ll be free.’
He leant up on his elbow and kissed her softly on the lips ‘I’ll never be free’ he whispered, then he
bent his head and grazed his lips on her neck ‘not from you.’
‘I wish you would say that to me some other time.’ she barely spoke but Harry was close enough to
hear it.
He breathed her in, feeling even more intoxicated by her scent. He kissed Ginny's neck lightly again
before looking at her drowsily through heavy eyelids, expecting to meet the same desire in her
eyes, but she was looking at him with a smile on her face, highly amused at something.
‘C’mon lover boy, I think it’s time you went to sleep!’ and she pushed him back down on the pillow,
curling into his body beside him. Harry hung his arm over her and nuzzled into her slender neck.
She chuckled lightly to herself as he brushed his lips over her skin, thoroughly enjoying himself,
though he had no idea what she found so amusing. Before long he had trouble keeping his head off
the pillow, so he relaxed back and as Ginny turned in the crook of his arm to face him, he opened
his eyes for just long enough to see a tear drop to the gentle smile on her lips. Before he had time
to register it, he was gone.
9. An End To Division and a New Position for Harry
Harry spent the next day rather uncomfortably.
For the first time he was glad to have the distraction of getting all of his gear washed and packed
into his trunk ready for the following day. He was acutely aware of how he had behaved towards
Ginny under the influence of Mrs. Weasleys so-called "light sleeping draft". What was worse, he
remembered everything he had said to her. A couple of times he caught her looking at him with a
slight smile playing across her lips, but she tactfully said nothing.
The next morning they all piled into Ministry cars and headed to Kings Cross Station. Although Harry
was loathed to have anything to do with the Ministry, Mr. Weasley had made it clear before he had
left for work that they were under instruction from Kingsley, and should prove quite manageable.
Harry was sat in a car separate from the others, squished uncomfortably in the backseat between
two of the biggest aurors he had ever seen, Kingsley Shacklebolt was in the passenger seat.
Harry sat, shoulders scrunched into his body and his legs uncomfortably pushed together; his
escorts knees splayed out because their incredibly huge thighs made it impossible for them to close
their legs any further. Kingsley had seemed quite amused by their size and cast Harry an
exaggerated look that suggested he thought they were quite as ridiculous as Harry did.
He noted the main foyer of the station was as busy as usual as they wheeled all their trunks behind
them. Glancing at the surrounding stalls, Harry stopped suddenly, causing the auror trailing behind
him to fall over his trolley. Harry heard the auror swearing over the clatter of his luggage as it
spilled onto the tiled floor but he paid no attention; he walked slowly up to the stand where a
newspaper headline had caught his eye and picked up a copy of the paper. On the front page was a
picture of what might have been a town once with the headline
- 66 -
TORNADO TEARS THROUGH TROWBRIDGE
Residents of the close-nit community of Trowbridge, just outside of Bath, are this morning at a loss
to explain the overnight devastation of their town. Emergency services were called out around 3 am
after an anonymous call was placed that a tornado had struck the tiny town and flattened almost
everything in its path. Casualties are as yet unknown. Meteorologists who were responsible for
monitoring the weather bands at the time say that their instruments showed no sign of any weather
disturbance and are adamant that no such thing could have occurred.
‘I challenge the twits to come down here and say that!’ angry local, Guthrey Pudderwell told us this
morning. Mr. Pudderwell had fortunately spent the night unconscious in a barn outside the town
limits after having difficulty finding his way home the previous evening. He was unable to give us
any further details of the storm, however Mr. Pudderwell assured us that it must have been a windy
night because on his stagger back from The Pig and Whistle, (a local drinking establishment), he
had somehow misplaced his hat.
Unfortunately our efforts to interview other locals have been hampered by Emergency Officials who
have kept everyone out of the site until it is deemed safe to enter…
Harry lowered the paper. Hermione, who had been reading the article over his shoulder, voiced
what he had been thinking ‘Giants!’
Ron, who had just joined them, grabbed the paper from Harry’s hands and read it.
‘They’ve started already.’ Harry said gravely as he looked at Hermione ‘How do you fight things that
are twenty feet high and have a natural resistance to magic?’
‘I don’t know’ Hermione said frowning with concern ‘but I think we need to pay Hagrid a visit as
soon as we can. Maybe he’ll know something?’
‘I don’t think fighting them is going to be an option.’ Ron said darkly returning the newspaper to the
stand as a grumpy assistant looked on.
‘What d'ya mean?’ Harry frowned.
Ron shrugged slightly and shook his head ‘I don’t know, just a thought.’ he said dismissively.
‘Come on!’ Mrs. Weasley had doubled back when she realized they were no longer following her
‘You’ve got seven minutes before the train leaves, now move it!’ she waved them on hurriedly.
After a very strained and teary farewell from Mrs. Weasley, they boarded the train with the two
enormous aurors carrying Pig and Hedwig in tow, followed by Kingsley. They made their way slowly
along the narrow passageway, and as they passed, Harry peered into the cabins, and though
Ministry guards who stood just inside the doorways blocked some compartments; others Harry
could see into, appeared full.
‘Right you lot!’ a gruff voiced man who was tall and hairy and outfitted in ministry guard robes, was
standing down the opposite end of the corridor waving his arms about like he was on a tarmac
attempting to land a plane, ‘in ‘ere’ A few doubtful looking fourth year Ravenclaws shuffled into a
compartment, as the door was closed behind them. ‘Rest of you … this way.’ he headed through the
connect doors into the next carriage.
As they dragged their trunks behind them everyone in the corridor lurched forward when the train
finally left the platform. Harry watched as people were sorted. He picked out Neville and Luna
entering a compartment with some sixth year Hufflepuffs, and also spotted Colin and Dennis
Creevey joining some other students he didn’t know. They were all compartmentalized gradually
until just the four of them and two very small first years, were left.
‘You lot can take this one!’ the gruff voiced man barred their way and opened the compartment
door.
As Harry waited for Ron, Hermione and Ginny to pile in before him, Kingsley called to him from
behind the two massive aurors. ‘I’ll be up the other end. I’ll leave these two here with you.’ he
raised an eyebrow comically, peering over one of their shoulders at Harry, then disappeared behind
the hulk as he walked away. Once inside Harry stowed his gear, relieving the guards of their cages
and slouching down in between Ron and one of the small boys sitting by the window. His brown
- 67 -
curls gave his already pink-cheeked freckly face an even younger appearance.
The other boy who sat opposite had black hair and very low set eyebrows and looked thoroughly
uninterested as he sat staring out the window. The train rattled along and Harry watched as the
curly haired boys eyes roamed around the cabin, stopping on Hermione and Ginny, the colour in his
cheeks rising when Ginny looked up and smiled at him. Harry smiled to himself as the boy looked
away nervously, continuing on to Ron who had his attention on Pig, and then finally Harry. The
boy’s lips curled in a brief smile as he met Harry’s gaze, then his eyes did the flick up to his scar.
Predictably his face changed immediately, draining of all colour; even his freckles seemed to pale as
he gaped open-mouthed, seemingly unable to look away. The dark haired boy noticed the change in
his companion and turned his head to look at Harry. His eyebrows lowered even more and his beady
eyes glittered as his mouth curled downwards into a furious pout. He stood up abruptly and with all
eyes on him, he crossed to the door and flung it open.
’You there!’ he said rudely as he peered round the enormous guard. ‘I’m not staying in here with
him!’ he said as he pointed at Harry ‘You’re going to have to move me!’
‘What’s all this about?’ the gruff man strode into view
‘Him!’ he looked accusingly at Harry ‘I’m not staying in here with him!’
‘And why not?’
The boy scowled in wonderment ‘because he’s the "Chosen One", he’s the one The Dark Lord’s
after. I don’t want to be caught in the crossfire when he gets attacked!’ he said indignantly. Harry
and Ron exchanged glances as Ginny scoffed and shook her head.
The man looked at Harry briefly and sighed ‘You’re not movin, everyone stays where they are. Now
get back to your seat before I set one of these two on you.’ He waved a finger at Harry’s escort and
turned away, the conversation clearly over.
The boy turned around red faced and paced back to his seat. He plonked himself back down next to
Hermione with an angry sigh and folded his arms across the front of him as he went back to staring
out of the window. This time however, he looked anything but disinterested. As the houses and
landscape flew by, he appeared to be looking very intently for any sign of an impending affront on
the compartment containing Harry Potter.
‘Well, isn’t this nice’ Hermione said looking around as their eyes flitted from one person to another.
‘Yeah, right cosy little group’ Ginny said eyeing the dark haired boy.
‘There’s one upside … no prefect duties!’ Ron smiled at Hermiones disapproving look.
The train journey was proving monotonous beyond compare and because no one was allowed to
leave their compartments to mix with friends it meant that Harry, Ron and Hermione were unable to
talk in private. Harry resigned himself to flipping through Quidditch Quips and Clueless
Commentary! An amusing little handbook Ron had bought in Flourish and Blotts. It was bound in
leather and gold leaf and was filled with quotable quotes from some of the most famous people in
the league, as well as some other less memorable folk who had made it in because of their game
steeling commentary. Harry turned each page half expecting to come across something of Luna’s
efforts from last year.
After they had donned their robes, the train grumbled to an uneventful halt, and they all piled out
heading down to the awaiting carriages. Hagrid was not there to greet the first years for only the
second time since Harry had been at Hogwarts. It wasn’t surprising though considering there were
so few of them, so Hermione appointed herself to shuffle them along the platform to the awaiting
transport.
It was then that Harry really noticed the difference in the number of students to previous years. In
the full moonlight, it was easy to see that the usual mass of heads bobbing up and down as they
descended the stairs had been reduced to around a hundred and fifty, and few, as Harry had
suspected, were below fourth year.
Harry went up to an awaiting Thestral and gave it a pat on the nose. It stared out at him through its
ghostly white eyes as it nudged his palm. ‘My last ride with you,’ He said quietly. He then joined
Neville, Luna, Ron and Hermione as they sat waiting to leave. As his guard positioned themselves,
- 68 -
one up front on the would-be drivers platform, and one standing on the stoop at the back, Harry
looked around the carriage. ‘Where’s Ginny?’
‘Oh, she went to sit with Seamus and Lavender.’ Luna said ‘I see Dean’s back as well. He wasn’t too
sure if he would be returning, you know.’ Harry tensed as she looked at Ron ‘I overheard him at
your place telling Ginny that he didn’t really see the point in coming back. Of course, she was quite
adamant that he should return.’ Harry felt his stomach drop painfully as the carriages started along
the road. ‘Looks like she managed to talk him round. He certainly looked pleased with himself about
something.’ She added dreamily.
As Luna spoke, a painful heaviness grew in Harry’s chest, making it hard for him to breathe. He
stared out the window to avoid the looks he knew Hermione would be throwing him. So Ginny had
wanted Dean to come back. She had convinced him it would be worth it. The thought made him
sick. Along with the hurt, Harry’s temper started to rise.
Is that what she had found so amusing when she was in his bed? Had she been thinking about Dean
then? Harry brought his elbow up to rest on the window ledge and rubbed his fingers on his
forehead. He thought about what he had said to her and swallowed hard, trying to ease the rising
heat in him. Luna spoke almost non-stop on their way into the Hogwarts grounds with Ron,
Hermione and Neville, who seemed to be aware of the tension, offering only stunted answers.
Hogwarts looked much more welcoming than it had when Harry had come at the beginning of
summer, but he passed it by and moved into the Great Hall without registering it.
‘Harry!’ Seamus came up from behind and as Harry turned automatically, his eyes fell on Ginny who
had strode in with Dean, both of them smiling as they came up behind Seamus.
‘Yeah?’ Harry said still watching Ginny and Dean.
‘It’s good to see you. I didn’t expect you’d be here this year after the rumours.’ Seamus patted
Harry’s shoulder.
‘I bet your not the only one.’ Harry was glaring at Dean who was laughing at something Ginny had
said.
‘Is everything alright?’ Seamus asked.
Harry tore his eyes away, annoyed at himself ‘Fine Seamus … how was your holiday?’ Harry forced
himself to concentrate on what Seamus was saying as they crossed the large gap between the
entrance door and the tables which were much shorter than usual, with only enough seating for a
quarter of the usual Hogwarts intake. As he sat himself right at the farthest end, Seamus sat next
to him and Ron plonked himself opposite. Hermione was looking up at the staff table as she sat
herself next to Ron.
‘Hagrids not here.’ Hermione said frowning. They all turned to look at the long staff table up at the
head of the Hall. Harry’s eyes dropped to Ginny who had sat down next to Lavender and Dean.
‘I wonder where he is then?’ Ron said ‘Did he say anything to you?’
‘No,’ Harry looked back at Hagrids empty chair. ‘Who have they got for Defence Against the Dark
Arts?’ Harry could see Professor Sprout and Flitwick. Slughorn was also there chatting to Professor
McGonagall and Madame Pomphrey.
Just then Professor McGonagall rose from her chair and silenced the chatter. She looked around at
the students for a moment, before beginning.
‘Welcome back to Hogwarts, such as it is. For those few of you who are here for the first time, I
extend a welcoming hand from all of our staff and older students, I am sure they will help you to
settle in under the rather unusual circumstances we find ourselves in.’ Harry looked around, the first
years were sitting together at the foot of the Hufflepuff table. Harry frowned and began searching
for the sorting hat. He caught Slughorn's eye and received a knowing wink before McGonagall
continued.
‘For the first time in Hogwarts history, there will be no sorting of the first years to begin the feast.’
A loud murmur erupted throughout the Hall as Harry exchanged looks with Ron and Hermione.
Professor McGonagall raised a hand and waited for quiet. ‘Amongst other changes being made for
this year at least, our staff has been reduced, and your lessons will combine all students within your
- 69 -
year who are taking the same subject. You will be made aware of the full changes tomorrow
morning after breakfast when you receive your new timetables. Also’ McGonagall seemed to
hesitate for the longest time before continuing ‘there will be new sleeping arrangements explained
to you after dinner.’
Everyone abandoned any pretence of hush and they all started talking rapidly amongst themselves.
McGonagall looked out at the din over her spectacles, but she did not try to quell the noise. The
other teachers were exchanging knowing glances as Harry looked back at Hermione and Ron who
were talking along with everyone else.
‘You mean they’re going to mix the houses?’ Ron asked, seemingly horrified at the thoughts of it.
‘Well it makes sense when you consider how few students and staff there are.’ She pointed out.
‘But they cant do that! That means we’ll be sharing passwords and …’ Ron was trying to find the
words ‘and … everything.’ He finally said.
‘So long as we don’t have to share with Slytherin, I don’t care.’ Seamus said darkly. Hermione
frowned slightly at him.
‘I don’t think it would be such a bad thing.’
‘What?’ Ron accidentally knocked over his empty goblet. ‘You’re joking aren’t you?'
‘No,’ she said seriously and before Ron could say anything else she put her finger to her lips and
turned back to McGonagall.
‘There are still a couple of items that need to be covered. Firstly, there will be no Quidditch this
year.’ There were multiple loud groans, especially from the Gryffindor table, though Harry, Ron and
Ginny, sat in silence ‘And we will not be appointing any new Prefects as I see enough have returned
to adequately perform the required duties.’ There were a couple of quietly disappointed groans from
the Ravenclaw table. ‘However, the time is right to inform you of your new Head Boy and Girl.
Harry noticed Hermione tense and a small smile crept across his lips. He knew how much she
wanted this and figured she was a shoo-in. Ron on the other hand looked down at the table
frowning to himself. Harry wondered if Ron really wanted the job after all. Even though he had
basked in the glory of being a Prefect in the beginning, he wasn’t exactly keen on the duties that
came with it, and this year especially, being Head Boy would probably involve even more of the sort
of work Ron liked to avoid. Harry looked back at McGonagall.
‘This year, we are pleased to announce our new Head Girl, Miss Hermione Granger,’ Hermione
exhaled and her shoulders relaxed almost immediately. Harry could tell she was holding back an
enormous grin and he was most impressed at her composure considering what must have been
going on inside ‘and Head Boy, Mr. Harry Potter.’
Harry had been watching Hermione but at the mention of his name his head swung round to look at
McGonagall. He sat bewildered for a moment, then looked back to Hermione as if waiting for her to
tell him it was a mistake, but she was smiling encouragingly at him, Ron grinning next to her.
What just happened?
Harry was frowning; he was trying to get his head around what McGonagall said, when someone
started to clap. As Harry looked round at Ginny, who was smiling and clapping her hands gently,
others started to join in. Slowly at first, but then the applause grew, and before he could speak
what was on his mind the whole room, bar a few Slytherins and the dark haired first year, was
clapping loudly and enthusiastically.
Harry looked back at Hermione. Her eyes looked slightly watery as she flushed, but she showed no
sign of the shock he had expected. Harry felt intensely awkward. It hadn’t occurred to him that he
would be in the running for Head Boy as he wasn’t a Prefect, and there was no way he could accept
the position because he had no idea how long he would even be at Hogwarts. As the applause died
down Professor McGonagall spoke once more.
‘We will now begin the feast.’ and as usual, huge dishes piled high with delicious looking food
appeared on the tables before them.
As everyone tucked in Harry leaned over his plate. ‘What does she mean by making me Head Boy?’
- 70 -
he said in a half whisper to Ron and Hermione.
‘You’re the obvious choice mate.’ Ron said happily as he brandished a chicken leg ‘They couldn’t
have picked a better person.’
‘That’s right, Harry’ Hermione was spooning corn onto her plate ‘you are intelligent, compassionate,
and you’re a natural leader.’ She stopped and looked at him ‘I don’t know why you’re so surprised’
Harry was looking at them as if they new something he didn’t. Seamus spoke up.
‘I know I’d rather have you as Head Boy than anyone else’ he said ‘especially with things the way
they are.’
‘Me too,’ Neville and Luna had been listening to the conversation ‘You are the best man for the job
Harry, and I’m really glad you decided to come back.’ Neville said earnestly.
Harry didn’t know what to say. He was heartened by their faith in him but he couldn’t very well tell
them that he probably wouldn’t be staying for long; that would lead to too many questions. So he
lifted a couple of lamb cutlets onto his plate and resigned himself to having a private conversation
with Professor McGonagall when he could.
‘Strange McGonagall didn’t mention who the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher is’ Luna
said, opening her protruding eyes. There was much speculation throughout the meal about who it
might be. And Professor McGonagall came over briefly to give Harry the new password to the
Common Room, though when he tried to engage her about his position as Head Boy, she held her
hand up and told him whatever he had to say, it could wait. After all the pudding plates vanished,
the students settled, whispering expectantly about the new sleeping arrangements. As McGonagall
stood, a hush spread through the Hall.
‘The sleeping arrangements have been made with everybody’s best interests in mind, so no further
discussions will be entered into.’ Eyes were darting this way and that at McGonagall's ominous tone.
It seemed very strange that they would not be siphoning off as usual to their houses.
‘All students fifth year and below will be housed in the Ravenclaw Chambers’ there was a murmur
and a turning of heads. ‘All students from the sixth and seventh years, will reside in the Gryffindor
Tower.’ Harry sat quietly as all of the older students, including the Slytherins exchanged incredulous
looks. It was as he had suspected.
The Ravenclaw chambers were high up in the castle, therefore better protected and harder for
outsiders to get to. And with the older students in the Gryffindor tower on the fourth floor, they had
a tactical advantage should the Castle be infiltrated. Although he was not looking forward to sharing
his beloved home with Slytherins, he understood the decision, so he remained quiet while
McGonagall waited for the angry whispers to subside.
‘All of your belongings will be waiting for you in your respective Common Rooms when you retire for
the evening…’ McGonagall launched into the usual spin about the Dark Forest and Mr. Filches
banned substances, then they were dismissed.
Harry led the way, with Hermione bringing up the rear to ensure that everyone knew where they
were supposed to go. He reached the portrait of the fat lady and was about to give her the
password, when she raised her eyebrows at the site of them and said sternly...
‘I don’t want any funny business going on behind these walls now that you are all in together.
You’re going to have to learn to get along.’ She pointed her finger at them ‘Even if you realize it or
not, its for your own good, and I for one, will be keeping an eye on you.’ She lowered an eyebrow
and looked down her nose at the Scowling Slytherins.
‘Chizpurfle’ said Harry.
‘You took the word right out of my mouth’ she sighed as she swung open to admit them.
Everyone milled around his or her trunks that were piled around the Common Room. Hermione
wove her way to Harry and said quietly ‘we’re going to have to sort them out. I’ve counted about
seventy of us all together.’
Harry looked about him, trying to gage how many of each house they had. It appeared there were
less Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs than Gryffindors and Slytherins, so Harry made a decision.
- 71 -
‘The Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff sixth years can bunk in together, everyone else can take a room for
your year and house.’ he spoke over the chatter.
‘How come we have to share?’ a disgruntled voice came from the crowd.
‘Because there aren’t enough rooms to go around.’ Hermione chipped in impatiently ‘And there are
fewer of you than the other houses.’
‘Well that’s hardly a reason, is it? I think we should draw straws’ came an indignant voice. Harry
saw Ernie MacMillan turn on the outspoken Ravenclaw.
‘You’ll do as your told!’ he said just as indignantly. A general argument broke out, centred around
Ernie and the Ravenclaw, everyone seemed to think they should not be the ones sharing. Harry
stood on his trunk and took out his wand. A noisy spray of red sparks shot out of the tip as he
pointed it above his head.
‘That’s enough!’ he said impatiently. Everyone fell very quiet as they turned to look at him
‘Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff sixth years will share a room. If anyone has any objections they are free
to spend the night outside in the hall.’ There were no further protests so Harry went on ‘Hermione
will sort the girls into their dorms … the rest of you will follow me.’
Harry stepped down off the trunk and Hermione gave him an appreciative look. ‘And you wonder
why McGonagall chose you as Head Boy.’ She smiled and led the girls to their rooms. Everyone
floated their trunks, and they dispersed without further ado. It wasn’t long before Harry was up at
the top most room of the boys tower once more; the room that Harry had considered home more
than any other. They unpacked and talked amongst themselves, though Harry avoided direct
contact with Dean, still unable to control the resentment that swelled in him. When they finally
retired to bed, Harry pulled the curtains shut and laid back with his hands behind his head.
He felt drained after the events of the evening, and no matter how hard he tried to turn his
thoughts to other things, Ginny’s face refused to leave his mind. He tortured himself with the
memory of a couple of nights ago. He had found her amusement bewildering at the time, but now
he felt a complete fool. He hated to admit the things he had said to her were unguarded and
honest, and it tore him that she found it so easy to move on. But a voice in the back of his mind
told him it was as it should be. It urged him to let go. He rolled on his side and tried to empty his
mind, but the image of Ginny and Dean would not budge.
~*~*~*~
The next morning, the Gryffindor Common Room was chaotic, to say the least.
Two Slytherins were bullying a sixth year Hufflepuff girl, and when Ernie and Justin Finch Fletchley
realized what was going on, they leapt gallantly at the hulks that were Crabbe and Goyle in her
defence. Unfortunately they stood no chance of winning a physical battle, and if it hadn’t been for
Ron and Harry’s appearance at the foot of the stairs, there may not have been much left of either of
them to rescue. Crabbe, sporting a face full of painful, pussy boils and Goyle, sprouting Cauliflower
from every orifice, scrambled through the portrait hole moments later, muttering profanities under
their breaths.
And twice Harry had to intervene in squabbles that had broken out between Slytherin and Gryffindor
sixth years. It seemed giving out detentions first time round wasn’t enough to deter them from
making easily overheard caustic complaints about one another, so Harry resorted with threatening
to bunk them in together until they learned to get along. This seemed to do the trick, and they all
went down to breakfast complaining about Harry instead.
‘This is hopeless!’ Harry said angrily to Hermione when she appeared.
‘I know what you mean. I found Hannah Abbott trying to throw Pansy Parkinson out of the window a
minute ago.’ She rolled her eyes ‘Pansy apparently commented on what a good job the Death
Eaters were doing ridding the world of Mudbloods and blood-traitors.’
‘Didn’t Hannah’s mother get killed last year?’ Ron asked frowning.
‘Exactly. That Pansy has got such a mouth on her!’ and most unlike her, Hermione added ‘If I’d just
- 72 -
taken that bit longer to steam my robes, it would have been over before I got there.’
At breakfast, Professor McGonagall handed out new timetables to the Gryffindor students. When she
got to Harry she asked him how things were going in the Gryffindor dormitories.
‘Couldn’t be worse. Thanks for asking.’ He answered
Her mouth had the tell tale signs of a suppressed smile as she raised an eyebrow. ‘You are more
than capable of dealing with it, Mr. Potter.’ Harry wondered where she got her information from. ‘I
want to see you in the Headmasters office after breakfast. I’ll give you your timetable then.’
‘I was just about to suggest the same thing actually.’
‘Good, then you wont be late!’ She said shrewdly. She gave him the password before turning to
Lavender.
Harry was just reaching for the scrambled eggs when Nearly Headless Nick drifted up through the
table towards McGonagall.
‘Where were you lot last night?’ Ron was referring to the ghosts whom Harry, along with almost
everyone else, had noted were not present at the start of term feast.
Nick turned his wobbling head ‘Ah! The insatiable curiosity that is the Wonderment of Youth. We
were on castle business if you must know, that of which pertained purely to the ethereal entities
residing in these grand and historic walls, and does not warrant an explanation to the likes of you.’
He said, looking very self-important.
‘In other words, mind your own business?’ Ron said glumly. Nick turned his nose up and floated to
where McGonagall stood. He spoke briefly to the Professor before heading down through the floor
again.
‘Ah ... Mr. Potter!’ Professor Slughorn appeared at his side, he appeared slightly thinner than Harry
remembered. ‘Looking forward to another year of outstanding potions from you.’ His face was
crinkled into an indulgent grin that did not meet his eyes. ‘Though I feel you may not be as keen as
you were last year. Your performance ... lagged somewhat towards the end.’
‘I’ll do my best.’
‘Barely need to Harry, m' boy! As I said, it’s in your blood, just like your mother. Well, must be off!
I am sure I will see you soon.’ he said with a wink, but Harry had the distinct impression he was not
as eager to be in Harry’s company as he tried to portray.
Harry spent the rest of breakfast steeling looks at Ginny, who was sitting with Luna at the other end
of the table, his thoughts turned to the book that currently sat in the room of requirement. If he
was going to have any chance of living up to Slughorns expectations he was going to have to
retrieve the princes copy of Advanced Potion Making. But did he really want to use it again?
‘Harry,’ He was roused immediately from his thoughts by Ginny’s voice. ‘Have you got a minute?’ He
nodded and stood as casually as he could while his insides burned, and followed her out of the hall.
When she reached the marble staircase she turned, looking slightly worried.
‘Do you still have that book?’
He did not need to ask what she was talking about. ‘Maybe. Why?’
‘I think you should use it.’ Her eyes had a glassy appearance, and she spoke as if the very words
leaving her mouth hurt. ‘It might help you … you know … in the future.’
Harry nodded stiffly ‘Why the sudden turn around? You weren’t so keen on my using it last year.’ he
said quietly, looking at her through narrowed eyes.
She closed her eyes for a fleeting moment before looking away from him. ‘Its better to know what
can be used against you Harry.’ He was silent for a moment as he watched her discomfort; she
couldn’t even look him in the eye. Harry found it hurt to be this close to her again. He turned and
headed for his meeting with McGonagall.
‘Fwooper!’ The large stone gargoyle slid aside and Harry mounted the stairs as they spiralled up to
the office.
‘Enter’ McGonagall was sitting behind the desk where Harry had seen Dumbledore sit so many times
before. She was placing a message into a tiny envelope. She glanced up at him as he walked slowly
up to the desk. ‘Sit down.’
- 73 -
He glanced around and saw the sorting hat perched on the bookshelf, the Gryffindor sword in its
glass case, gleaming not far away. He also noticed the office was still full of Dumbledores things,
though they no longer whirred busily or puffed with smoke. Instead they sat quietly, uselessly;
dead. The portraits appeared to be sleeping, but Harry had too much experience with them to take
that for granted. His eyes fell on Dumbledore; his chin rested on his chest peacefully as he sat in a
large comfortable chair. Harry felt an acute emptiness at the sight of him.
As he slouched into the chair opposite McGonagall, it struck him that he had thought Dumbledore
would always be at Hogwarts. It seemed impossible to imagine the school without him, yet here
Harry sat, more alone now than ever. He could never again seek the guidance of his long time
mentor and friend. As Harry’s eyes dropped to the floor, McGonagall stood up and placed the
message in the beak of a tawny owl that waited patiently on the stand where Fawkes once sat. The
owl launched into the air and in a flurry of silent feathers, disappearing through an open window.
When Harry looked up again, Professor McGonagall was watching him.
‘You have something you wish to say to me.’ She said gravely.
Harry straightened himself uncomfortably under her gaze.
‘There must be someone better for the position of Head Boy.’ He waited for her to say something,
but she only nodded as she sat down and folded her hands on the desk. Harry went on ‘I’ll be
leaving again soon … and I don’t even know if I’ll be back’ McGonagall’s eyes were on her hands as
Harry spoke uncertainly. ‘Point is I wont be able to perform as Head Boy all the time.’
‘I see.’ She looked at him, her expression as stern as usual ‘And how do you expect to keep up with
your classes under those circumstances?’ Harry felt slightly annoyed that all she seemed to be
worried about was his homework.
‘I’ll manage … somehow. And if I cant, I’ll leave anyway … permanently’
McGonagall nodded and stood up. She walked slowly around the desk and spoke without looking at
Harry. ‘This is how it will work, Potter. You will be free to come and go, though I will ask you to
inform me when you leave so I can make other arrangements. And I think it is a good idea that you
drop at least two of your subjects. You can pick them up again at a later stage if necessary.’ She
frowned as she finally lifted her head. ‘You shouldn’t be taking on too much if you are to do the
Defence Against the Dark Arts classes for the younger students as well.’
Harry was silent for a moment, not sure if he had understood what Professor McGonagall had said.
He decided he must have misheard her ‘Sorry?’
‘You heard me correctly, Mr. Potter. The new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor cannot take
the position on full time, which leaves the younger students, fifth year and below to be exact,
without a teacher. This is not an acceptable situation given the threat we currently live under, I am
sure you agree. You have already proven your teaching abilities by the results your Dumbledores
Army students received in their OWLS. And I think it would benefit the children greatly if you were
to take the lessons.’
‘But I just finished telling you that I wont always be here’ Harry was certain he was missing
something.
‘Which is why I have asked you to inform me of your leaving. You will agree that some Defence
Against the Dark Arts classes is preferable to none.’
‘But I wouldn’t know where to start.’
‘Miss Granger would be an excellent candidate to assist you in planning.’ She said ‘It will not take up
too much of your time. The classes will be combined and you will be given the Great Hall to conduct
your lessons.’ Harry’s head was buzzing as she added ‘If they agree to it, I will organize for Mr.
Weasley and Miss Granger to assist you in class. The students are all at different learning levels, so
you will need the help.’ She motioned Harry to stand.
Harry stood up, completely flummoxed. He had come here with the intention of giving up his Head
Boy status, and instead, had somehow wound up as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher to
boot.
- 74 -
‘I’ll send you a new timetable at Lunch, until then your time is free. Here is a list of all the
passwords you will need as Head Boy.’ McGonagall handed him a piece of parchment as she herded
him towards the door ‘If you could pass them on to Miss Granger when you are done. You can also
inform Mr. Weasley he will be acting Head Boy whenever you are absent from the castle.’
‘But, I don’t-'
‘This was not a popularity contest, Mr. Potter’ she cut him off as he stood outside the large double
doors ‘you are Head Boy because you are the ideal candidate. Personally I think it would be rather
selfish of you to resign.’ she seemed to soften slightly as she added ‘The students will need you
Harry … before the end.’
~*~*~*~
As promised, McGonagall had Harry’s new timetable delivered to him at Lunch. It was a given that
he would be taking DADA classes, but he was pleased to see she had kept Charms and
Transfiguration. He agreed with Ginny’s reasoning about the prince's book, and since McGonagall
had seen fit to include Potions in his schedule, he decided he would head up to the Room of
Requirement later when everyone had retired to the Common Room.
Hermione was extremely enthusiastic about Harry’s new appointment, and whole-heartedly agreed
to help him plan and conduct the lessons. Rather annoyingly, Ron and Hermione had sided with
Professor McGonagall on every point she had put forward to Harry, thereby robbing him of any
chance of justification of his doubt. McGonagall had already arranged it so they would have no
trouble fitting the classes in between their own subjects; seemingly she had known they would be
keen to help, and so it was that they set about planning the first lesson out of three they were to
conduct each week.
Hermione made rather a quick job of it. She bolted off to the library as soon as she had scoffed
down lunch, and when she and Ron met up with Harry for dinner, she handed him a complete
schedule for each age group for the first two weeks, including a break-up floor plan to allow for the
required space needed.
‘How did you do that?’ asked Harry stunned.
‘It wasn’t that hard. All I had to do was take out some of my notes from the classes we’d done and
combine it with some information from the library.’
‘We kept in anything that might come in handy in the near future.’ Ron added.
‘This is great!’ Harry felt more comfortable with the idea now that he had a plan in front of him. He
gave Hermione an appreciative kiss on the cheek. ‘Its brilliant’
‘It was no trouble, I really quite enjoyed doing it.’ She said looking very pleased with herself.
The time spent in the common room that evening was a nightmare. There was so much resentful
squabbling going on around the room that everyone was on edge whether they were involved in it
or not. And much to Harry’s annoyance, Ginny spent a lot of time tucked away in the corner of the
room with Dean.
Harry couldn’t stop glancing their way and even though they both had their books open, they spent
most of their time talking animatedly. When Dean met Harry’s glance he shifted in his seat
uncomfortably and bent his head to Ginny’s ear. The anger in Harry was stewing in the atmosphere
of the room as he turned his head back to the crackling fireplace to avoid Ginny’s gaze.
Hermione was returning from the girl’s dorm upstairs, where she had rushed off to after a shouting
match had erupted, looking agitated.
‘Its just as well we don’t have house points this year,’ she said as she sat on the floor in front of
Ron ‘They’d all be so deep in the negatives that there wouldn’t be enough jewels in the hour glass
to count them.’
‘What was it this time?’ Ron asked rubbing her shoulders.
‘Don’t ask!’ she said as she rolled her eyes ‘Just be thankful your sleeping in the boys dorm with the
- 75 -
mess they’ve created up there. I told them you cant throw multiple hexes like that all at once
without consequences.’ She looked up as two Ravenclaw girls appeared at the foot of the stairs.
One had her arm around the other who was desperately trying to shield a collection of enormous
red bulbs on the end of her nose. Hermione made a disapproving noise with her tongue as they
crossed the room, heading for the hospital wing.
Harry stood up, ‘I’m going to fetch Snape's book. I’ll be back soon.’
‘Alright, I’ll wait for you before we do the nightly rounds.’ Hermione looked slightly uneasy as Harry
headed out of the portrait hole.
He pulled his invisibility cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself as he took off for the
seventh floor. Harry thought it a wise precaution to keep carrying it with him everywhere because
Dumbledore had told him to do it last year, and the situation could only be worse now that he was
no longer around.
The empty stone passageways were already chilled with autumn’s nighttime breeze as Harry slipped
through a shortcut and up some stairs, and then to the corridor where the painting of the dancing
trolls resided. He looked around to make sure no one was about, chiding himself for not thinking to
grab the Marauders Map before he left, then proceeded to walk up and down outside the place
where the door would appear.
I need to find my Advanced Potion Making book. I need to find my Advanced Potion Making book. I
need to find my Advanced Potion Making book.
Harry looked up at the wall. No door. What? So he tried again.
I need to find my copy of Advanced Potion Making that I hid here last year. I need to find my copy
of Advanced Potion Making that I hid here last year. I need to find my copy of Advanced Potion
Making that I hid here last year.
He looked up and frowned. Still nothing. How can that be? He couldn’t understand it. He had hidden
Snapes book here and he should be able to… Then it occurred to him.
I need to retrieve Snapes book of Advanced Potion Making that I hid here last year.
After repeating it for the third time the door appeared and Harry opened it quickly, stepping into the
darkness and pulling it closed behind him.
10. The Locket
Tall dark shadows loomed in on Harry as he pulled off the cloak. Tucking it back into his pocket, he
pulled out his wand and lit it.
The vast room looked entirely different. The first time he had visited it, light had streamed through
the tall windows that looked out over the grounds. Now only the waning moons light, obscured by
gathering cloud, pierced the mass of paraphernalia that filled the room.
Harry made his way slowly in the direction he had run; book in hand, desperately searching for a
hiding place last year. Impatient, but sure he had turned right at some point, he passed the
mountains of broken furniture, books and banned substances, waiting for a sign of recognition;
something that might trigger his memory and point the way.
He felt like he had been walking too long, and his anger, which had been simmering below the
surface in the Common Room, threatened to boil. The distant rumble of thunder accompanying the
outside cloud adding to his growing frustration. The openings in the alley he followed meant nothing
to him. He was beginning to think he must have missed what he was looking for when an
enormous, ugly and fierce looking stuffed troll came into his wands circle of light. This is it! With
renewed confidence he turned right and continued on, the occasional flash of far away lightening
illuminating the high arched ceiling as he searched for another familiar landmark.
- 76 -
Then his stomach lurched painfully. The vanishing cabinet Draco had spent most of last year
restoring stood on the corner of the isle that Harry stumbled into months ago.
Harry walked slowly up to it; regarding it darkly as if it might suddenly spring open with Death
Eaters spewing forth from it. But it lurked silently in the shadows now forgotten, having served its
purpose. His mouth went dry as a nurtured and unrealised anger born of guilt swelled within him.
How had he forgotten that he had seen it the first time he came through? He should have stopped
to look at it more closely then, maybe he could have prevented... He stopped the thought angrily.
He dragged his eyes away from its dark bulk as he turned into the alley and started searching for
the marker he had left behind.
Using his wand light, he scanned the isle until its light fell upon a bust sitting atop a blistered
cupboard. It was the ugly warlock bust wearing the scraggy old wig and tiara Harry had put there.
He stopped in front of it as another searing flash of lighening flickered across the room. Reaching a
hand up, he turned the cold brass handle. The door creaked loudly in the quiet darkness as it
opened, and pointing the glowing wand tip inside, he bent down and pulled the book from its hiding
place behind the cage.
Harry turned it over in his hands as another, louder rumble of thunder rolled overhead, rattling the
contents of the room; it was just as he had left it. This was the first time he had looked upon the
book since discovering the identity of the "prince". The thought that the prince had turned out to be
Snape sickened him. If he had shown Dumbledore the book, if he had turned it over to him, would
he still be alive? He would have recognized Snapes handwriting. Would it have been enough to
prove his trust in Snape was horribly wrong?
Slamming the cupboard door shut, he headed back in the direction he had come. The anger and
guilt that he had harboured for so long seethed restlessly in his body, heightened by the sight of
Dumbledores doom as he passed the cabinet, unconsciously giving it a wide birth, and traced his
way back along the alley, breathing heavily as his insides shook. The troll lit up briefly as another
more severe flash of lightening illuminated the surroundings, and as he rounded it he spied a glint
of silver out of the corner of his eye.
He stopped, just as a rumble of thunder vibrated the windows, and looked down at a large, heavy
steel instrument. He paused for only a moment before picking it up and turning back into the alley
he had just come from.
He strode with purpose; his mind now set on one all consuming course of action, unable and
unwilling to stop himself. When he came upon his target, he stowed the book and his wand
mindlessly onto the nearest surface, and in the gloom, eyeing the vanishing cabinet vengefully,
Harry lifted the huge silver axe back behind him. He drew breath angrily through his teeth before he
swung the bloodied blade with all the strength that his gathering hatred could muster.
The booming crash of the blow echoed in the high ceiling as the cabinet’s side buckled with the
force. Harry put his foot against the treacherous wood and levered the axe out. A brilliant flicker of
lightening forked across the sky outside as he leaned back, pulling it behind him again. His eyes
stung and his face contorted with pain as a thunderous clap shook the windows.
He brought the axe forward with incredible force, sinking it into the cabinet again. The wood folded
in on itself as it shattered, sending stabbing splinters in all directions, one scoring him across the
face, but Harry barely felt it. Again, he pushed his foot against the broken wood; his arm muscles
straining and beads of sweat dripping down his forehead as he pulled the axe head free.
All of the anger, all of the hatred, and all of the guilt he had clung to and silently nurtured since
Dumbledores death, coursed through his veins as he stepped away and brought the axe back
behind him again. He threw his weight forward and let the silver blade fly crushingly into the now
bent cabinet, again … and again, with a strength he hadn’t known he possessed.
The harsh sounds of shattering wood were mixed with the deafening cracks of thunder until finally
the cabinet hung broken and defeated. The axe came easily free of the limp wreckage as Harry
pulled it to him one last time. Hot, bitter tears were running down his face as he lifted the axe
above his head, and with both hands he delivered the final devastating blow as the last clap of
thunder rang out.
- 77 -
Finally, Harry was spent. The storm was passing, leaving behind a gloomy stillness. Panting in fury
and pain he dropped to his knees still clutching the axe. His body was racked with weariness, and
his mind was dark and torturous. And his heart was desolate. He hung his head low and his
shoulders slumped forward as his grief overwhelmed him.
He thought of all those he had lost … the people he had loved and who had loved him back.
Of the struggle that awaited him … the impossible task he was left to do.
And of the fears he had for those he loved … the thought of losing them too much to bear. His pain
poured out silently in the dim quiet.
He might have knelt there for an hour or more, alone with his pain, but when he finally lifted his
head in the darkness, it was with the resolve that he could wait no longer. He would find out what
Kreacher knew about the locket and he would hunt down the first of the four Horcruxes. He would
not stray from his path again; he would not give in to the temptation of ignorance. He had been
selfish to think he could stay. More people would die the longer he hesitated.
He stood up, feeling utterly drained, and steeling one last look at the shrapnel he had vented
himself on, he collected his wand and book, and headed for the Common Room.
Blaise Zabini was slouched with Pansy Parkinson under the unicorn tapestry deep in conversation
when Harry appeared through the portrait hole. They both stopped immediately and stared at the
sight of him. Colin Creevey was finishing a game of exploding snap with Neville at one of the study
tables; they too eyed Harry with uncertain, even frightened looks as he moved passed them.
‘Harry!’ Hermione had been pacing by the fire, a worried expression on her face. ‘What happened?’
she rushed over to him in alarm and grabbed his arms to study him. ‘Oh Harry,’ she breathed on
the verge of tears ‘are you alright?’
‘I’m leaving … tonight. But I need everyone out of here so I can speak to Kreacher before I go.’
She looked at him curiously for a moment, but his demeanour moved her into action
unquestioningly. She nodded, frowning and turned on the others. ‘Alright, bed!’ she said, her voice
slightly squeaky.
‘What?’ scoffed Blaise ‘You can’t tell us when to go to-' But he stopped suddenly as Hermione drew
her wand out and pointed at him.
‘Now!’ she commanded, her voice suddenly stern.
He threw his book down angrily and Pansy scowled as they both stood and headed to their
dormitories. Colin had mounted the stairs hastily the moment he had seen Hermione reach for her
wand, but Neville stood staring at Harry.
‘I can help Harry.’ he said as he swallowed nervously ‘Whatever it is, I-I want to help.’ Harry had a
growing respect for Neville over the past two years, but he didn’t want to involve him if he didn’t
have to.
‘Thanks Neville … but not this time.’ He said gravely. Neville nodded and walked to the stairwell. He
put a foot on the first step then turned back to Harry.
‘If you change your mind, I’ve still got my DA coin’ he flashed a crooked smile and disappeared up
the stairs.
‘Where’s Ron?’ Harry just realized he wasn’t in the room.
‘He started rounds and told me to wait here in case you returned. I’ll go and fetch him.’
‘Okay’ Harry lifted his head to call the house elf ‘Krea-‘
‘Harry!’ Hermione bumped his shoulder and motioned her head at the large, high-backed armchair
facing the fire before she crossed the room and clambered through the portal to find Ron. Harry
frowned and took a few steps to the side, and then bowed his head, reigning in the feelings that
flared at the sight of Ginny.
- 78 -
Because Ron and Hermione were worried, she had waited for him. She had not let go to the extent
he thought. When he finally looked up again, she was standing before him. She lifted her hand to
Harry’s face and brushed it lightly across his cheek, turning the palm towards him with questioning
concern.
Harry looked down at the blood on her fingers. ‘Not too subtle, am I?’
‘You’re leaving.’ She said frowning slightly.
‘Yeah’ he spoke gently.
She took a deep breath and turned her eyes to the ceiling in a bid to hold back the tears that
threatened. ‘I’m with Neville.’ She said quietly, bringing her eyes back to his. ‘Dumbledore knew
you could not do this completely alone. You’ll need help, Harry.’ Then she added ‘If you need
someone, call … your friends will be there for you.’
Harry brought his eyebrows together. She spoke almost as if she knew what he was leaving to do.
She continued ‘Whatever you’re up to, he asked you to involve Hermione and Ron didn’t he?’
‘Yes … but how did you know-'
‘they’re your best friends Harry. The three of you are regularly off talking about things you don’t
want anyone else to hear.’ Harry relaxed a little ‘Just remember they are here, Harry. Remember
they have a right to be involved even if you don’t want to involve them. Its not fair to shut out the
people who care about you.’
Harry watched her as her eyes swam with tears; he knew she was no longer talking about just Ron
and Hermione. He reached up and put his hand to her cheek, moving in close until their bodies
touched. Her frown deepened as she looked up at him.
‘You’re strong Ginny. You’ll come through all of this and be happy in the end.’ Harry wanted to
believe this more than anything else. He could forgive her betrayal of him; he could forgive her
turning to Dean, if only she would be happy.
Without being aware of what he was doing, his mouth came down to meet hers as she closed her
eyes, spilling her tears. Their lips met sadly and tenderly, caressing softly as they played gently
across one another before Harry pulled himself back, still unable to control the need he had for her.
He reached around his neck and unhooked the pendant belonging to his parents, which he had worn
almost continuously since coming upon it. He lifted her hand and placed it in her palm, gently
closing her fingers over it.
‘Keep this for me. I’ll be back for it … I promise’
Her eyes were full of doubt as she searched his face. She kissed him quickly before turning from
him and heading up the stairs. As he watched her go, his whole body ached for her. He turned to
the fire and stared at the dying flickers of light. He could not bear to see her unhappy. He would let
her go completely when she was ready. He would spare her the pain of being with him.
‘Hey’ Ron and Hermione were coming towards him; both looking painfully worried. Harry nodded in
acknowledgement.
‘Why the sudden change mate? I thought you’d be happy here for a bit.’ Ron said with concern.
‘I cant sit around and wait while more people are being killed.’ Harry stayed staring at the glowing
embers. ‘I can’t pretend that I can go on like normal. None of this is going to go away until I do
something about it.’
‘We’ll go with you, Harry. There’s a be-'
‘No!’ He cut Hermione off abruptly in his urgency, but then added ‘you’re both needed here. You’ll
be able to keep an eye on things and at least I’ll always know where you are if I need help.’
‘Harry, I’ve told you before, we’re go-'
‘If I thought it was the best thing to do, I’d agree with you Ron.’ He had to convince them to stay
‘we still haven’t worked out what one of the Horcruxes is, and we have no idea where to find the
Hufflepuff cup. You two have to find the answers, or we’re already lost...’ Harry’s voice faded as he
looked back into the fireplace.
There was a long silence before Ron spoke ‘What are you going to do?’
- 79 -
Harry looked at them ‘Call Kreacher and find the real Slytherin locket.’
Ron nodded with his eyes on the floor. ‘Alright’
‘Check the stairwells first just in case.’
‘Good idea,’ At Harry’s instruction, Hermione mounted the stairs that led to the female dormitories
and Ron disappeared up the boy’s entrance. They came back moments later with the all clear.
‘Kreacher!’ The house elf appeared before them with his arms flailing as if in the middle of a fight.
‘What? What’s this?’ it croaked, looking about. The trio stared down at him in silence. Kreacher was
splattered with wet, slimy looking black mud and the cloth he draped over himself, which was
already shabby, appeared to have fresh tears in places.
‘Have you and Dobby been fighting again?’ Ron shook his head as he raised an eyebrow. But as
Kreacher gave Ron a scowl, Harry grabbed his arm and swung him round to face him, summoning
all his anger as he looked into the little elf’s eyes.
‘I’m going to ask you some questions Kreacher and I want straight answers, do you understand
me?’ He was stony faced as Kreacher squirmed.
‘Master knows Kreacher is-' Kreacher was about to launch into his usual routine when Harry cut him
off.
‘Don’t, Kreacher. I’m warning you. I’m not in the mood!’ Harry was eyeing the elf darkly. He waited
until Kreacher stopped trying to wriggle free before adding ‘Just answer my questions.’
The wrinkled old elf smirked oddly as he bowed. ‘Master is more worthy than Kreacher has guessed.
Kreacher will hear what Master has to say.’
Harry let go of the elf’s bony little arm and perched on the edge of a nearby chair. He held the gaze
of Kreacher’s bloodshot eyes as he asked ‘Did you accompany Regulus when he visited a cave to
retrieve something very secret?’ Kreacher’s face dropped immediately. He stared at Harry for a
moment then placed his hands over his ears.
‘Kreacher cannot! Kreacher is bound to keep Masters secrets.’ The little elf shook his head.
‘I am your master now, Kreacher’ Harry said aggressively ‘and you will answer me!’ then because
Kreacher did not speak though his eyes widened, he snapped ‘Answer me!’
‘Yes!’ the elf hissed.
‘Did either of you manage to retrieve the locket?’ Harry was careful with his wording so Kreacher
could not twist it.
The elf let out a nervous squeal before answering ‘Yes!’
The elf was extremely agitated, but it appeared as before, Kreacher was forced to answer. ‘Has the
locket been destroyed?’ Harry kept his voice cold and hard. Kreacher looked like he wanted to
dissolve into the floor.
‘No!’ he squawked, terrified.
Harry, Hermione and Ron all looked at each other.
Harry continued ‘Do you know what happened to the locket?’
‘Yes!’ the elf looked shocked at his own words.
Harry frowned ‘W-What happened after you obtained locket?’ he asked slowly, aware the answers
he sought lay with the right questions.
‘Master Black was unable to open it before the Death Eaters tracked him down.’ Kreacher’s mouth
appeared to be speaking almost independently of him. He dropped to the floor and started to
wriggle on his back.
‘What happened to the locket after Regulus died?’
‘Kreacher took it!’ Wide-eyed with shock, Kreacher’s hand whipped up to cover his mouth in an
effort to restrain himself as he struggled on the floor.
‘What did you do with it?’ Harry’s heartbeat quickened as he pursued him determinedly.
‘Kreacher gave it to his mistress as a present.’ Kreacher started to writhe around on the floor,
- 80 -
smearing mud all over the ornate, faded rug. Hermione watched with a mixture of horror and pity.
‘What did Mrs. Black do with it?’
‘She counted it amongst her finest possessions. She kept it in a glass cabinet in the drawing room.’
‘Of course!’
Harry spun round to look at Hermione as she spoke ‘I remember! When we were cleaning Sirius’s
place there was a locket, none of us could get it open. That must have been it! Oh…’ her face
suddenly paled ‘Harry, we threw it away.’ She breathed.
Harry’s stomach dropped. Now that she mentioned it, he did vaguely remember something like that.
But they threw everything from the cabinets away. He buried his head in his hands, not wanting to
think about what they had done.
‘Harry,’ Ron said gravely ‘Ask Kreacher if he’s seen the locket since we chucked it.’
‘Why?’ Harry sounded defeated as he spoke ‘We disposed of it Ron, it’ll be long gone-'
‘Just do it.’
Harry looked back at Kreacher who was positively thrashing about ‘Kreacher, have you seen the
locket since we threw it out?’ he asked expecting a resounding No.
‘Yes!’ Harry looked at Ron who motioned the elf. Kreacher was getting more and more urgent in his
effort to stop himself from speaking.
‘How did you know?’ Harry turned to Ron.
‘Just a guess. He was trying to sneak stuff away all the time, remember? If it meant so much to the
old bat, he would’ve made a bee-line for it.’ Harry smiled appreciatively at Ron then turned his
attention back to the elf still struggling on the floor.
‘Do you know where the locket is, Kreacher?’
‘Yes!’
‘Where is it?’ Harry hurried on
‘In … Kreacher’s … spot.’ He panted.
‘What, its here?’ said Ron
‘Stupid blood traitor-’
‘Where is your spot Kreacher?’ Harry said through gritted teeth.
‘Kreacher’s bed at his mistresses house.’ the elf exhaled, his body going limp. It appeared he had
told them all he knew for he stood up looking exhausted, having fought a losing battle, and scowled
at them ‘Kreacher will go now!’ before vanishing.
Harry stuffed his backpack with everything he thought he might need and hastily wrote a note to
McGonagall, leaving the Marauders Map with Ron, and then the three of them met back in the
Common Room.
‘Stay out of trouble.’ Ron said ‘I know that’s asking a lot’ he smiled awkwardly.
‘Wherever possible,' he said quietly
‘How are we going to stay in touch?’
‘via these’ Hermione handed Harry one of two small emerald books.
‘What’s this?’ Harry opened it and flicked through the blank pages.
‘It’s a message log. Whatever you write on the front of a page will show up on the back of the same
page in this book’ she waved the one she held in her hand ‘and vice versa’
‘That’s brilliant’ Harry shook his head ‘How did you do it?’
‘I didn’t. I took them from that box of test stuff Fred and George brought round over the holidays.’
Harry and Ron raised their eyebrows at her. Hermione flushed ‘Well, they really do have some
extraordinary magic, and I thought these would come in handy.’ Harry stowed the book away and
swung his cloak over him.
When he reached the large iron gates, he pointed his wand from under his cloak. McGonagall had
included the gate password on the list she had given him for the Heads, with the understanding that
he would need to use it on occasion. The enormous lock clunked open and the chains dropped away
noisily. Harry opened the gate quickly and slipped through it, turning to lock it again.
- 81 -
He concentrated and found himself outside thirteen Grimmauld Place. Once he was back inside his
temporary home he lit several candles and went from room to room looking for any sign of someone
staying there, but there was no one about, and it looked as if Lupin hadn’t been back since his last
transformation just after Diagon Alley. So Harry dumped his pack on the bed and returned to the
kitchen. Getting down on his hands and knees, he lit his wand and crawled into the small space that
Kreacher called home.
With a sense of urgency, he rifled through the bedding, pulling out old photos and clothing that
used to belong to Sirius’s mother and father, then his hand hit on something small, smooth and
cold. He closed his hand around it and backed out of the tiny space. Even before he opened his
palm he knew this was it. It had an unnatural heaviness to it as the chain dangled through his
fingers.
Harry turned it over and traced the outline of the "S" shaped serpent on the front. It seemed
incredible to think he held a piece of Voldemort's soul in the palm of his hand. He finally stood and
walked over to the kitchen table. Sitting down he pulled a candle close, tucked his wand back in his
pocket, and rested his elbows on the table, turning the locket over in his fingers. His eyes narrowed
and mouth curled in distaste. Harry knew Voldemort had killed to make it and the thought repulsed
him. Though he knew it was pointless, he tried to open it, and as suspected, it proved impossible.
Suddenly the fireplace burst into roaring green flames. Expecting that Lupin was finally returning,
Harry quickly tucked the locket away in his pocket. But as he watched the figure emerge from the
flames Harry’s heart began to pound in his chest.
All in one move he leapt to his feet, whipped his wand out and aimed it at Snape ‘Petrificus Totalus!’
~*~*~*~
The spell bounced off Snape and collided with the wall; the sound of cracking stone tore through the
kitchen as Snape glared at Harry.
‘Stupefy!’ Harry yelled as he backed away, trying desperately to put some distance between them.
Again, the spell ricocheted off him as Snape flicked his wand, sending the iron candelabra that hung
from the roof crashing down onto the table. The candle Harry had been using was thrown from the
table by the force of the impact and rolled onto the chair he had been sitting on, its light flickering
eerie shadows across the room. Snape snarled as he moved his wand.
‘Protego!’ Harry instantly blocked the spell as the ropes that unfurled from Snapes wand uselessly
dropped to the floor. There was another flick from Snape. Harry dived into the sitting room,
narrowly avoiding a beam of light.
‘I see your skills have not improved.’ Snapes voice goaded as Harry scrambled to his feet. Harry
aimed at the doorway, his heartbeat racing as Snapes silhouette emerged, distorted by the
flickering light.
‘Expelliarmus!’
The curse hit Snape's shield and was deflected as he immediately sent a white light streaking
towards Harry, throwing him backwards into the cold dark fireplace. His hand slammed painfully
into the stone arch, sending his wand flying to the floor, disappearing as it rolled under an armchair.
The ash and soot flurried around him in his panic to find his feet. His mouth and nose were choked
and his eyes were being inundated as he struggled to open them. He spluttered as he pulled himself
forward, temporarily unable to see, his heart pounding in his chest as something was thrust into the
flesh under his chin, forcing his head up.
‘I can still read you like a book.’ Snape pressed his wand tip further under Harry’s chin ‘You are no
better off than you were two years ago.’ Harry was trying to keep his eyes open though they stung
with ash. ‘Do you delude yourself that you can take on the Dark Lord like this?’ Snape leaned in
close ‘to him you have the powers of insect. And he will crush you under his foot just as easily.’
- 82 -
Harry cringed in revulsion at Snapes nearness, the panic rising in him. Then the wand tip was gone,
allowing him to lower his head. His eyes had sufficiently watered to get rid of most of the grit as he
watched Snape put a few paces distance between them, eyeing Harry suspiciously and keeping his
wand directed at Harry’s chest.
Harry glanced down out of the corner of his eyes to where his wand had disappeared ‘Don’t bother
going for it,’ Snape said, looking down his hooked nose at him. ‘Unless you want to be incarcerated
again.’ He raised and eyebrow ‘My last visit should put you off repeating that particular little stunt.’
‘What do you want?’ Harry said savagely, his chest heaving with anger. This was the second time
Snape had got the better of him. There would not be a third.
‘I’ve come to give you the information I promised.’ Snape voice was silky as he pulled a small scroll
from his robes and held it aloft. Harry eyed it for a moment, frowning dubiously. ‘It wont bite,’
Snape said sarcastically and narrowed his eyes ‘not if you do as instructed.’ Harry reached a hand
up and took the scroll, all the while wondering why he was listening to this traitor.
‘What is it?’ Harry did not attempt to hide the loathing in his voice.
‘It is your key to Bellatrix LeStrange.’ Snape said. ‘However, if you try to open it before six pm on
All Hallows Eve, it will ignite.’ Harry stopped fumbling with the seal on the scroll and looked back at
Snape ‘After six pm on Halloween, you will have a window of five minutes with which to read it, and
memorize it.’
‘Memorize it?’ Harry eyed Snape distrustfully.
‘You will find out what I mean on Halloween, not before.’ Snape said unhelpfully.
Harry narrowed his eyes and scowled ‘It’s a trap, isn’t it? If you think I’m stupid enough to-’
‘I could easily force you to come with me right now.’ Snape said threateningly.
‘I wouldn’t go without a fight!’ Harry spat. Snape sneered mockingly as he shook his head. Then
suddenly, his face was stony.
‘You’d follow me like an eager little puppy if I wanted you to.’
Harry’s chest was heaving as the anger coursed through him.
‘If you want Bellatrix, you will be in the Great Hall at the Halloween feast, opening that at precisely
six pm.’ Snape pointed his wand at the scroll in Harry’s hand.
‘Why do I have to be at Hogwarts?’
‘Don’t ask pointless questions, Potter’ he snapped angrily ‘you will know only when you read the
note.’
‘I’m not going to endanger the school.’ Harry said with his jaw clenched.
'If you do not do as I have instructed, believe me, the school will be under threat.' A knot formed in
Harry’s stomach as his mouth went dry.
‘What are talking about?’
‘Just do as your told for once in your life!’ Snape growled, then he added silkily ‘Do nothing until
Halloween, as I’ve said, and remember’ Snape took a step closer to Harry ‘do not breathe a word of
this to anyone in the meantime. Your revenge on Bellatrix depends on it.’
Harry struggled with his loathing and distrust for Snape, and the feeling of dread that had overcome
him. He could not afford to ignore Snape's warning.
Snape was staring at Harry questioningly through narrowed eyes, and as Harry stood there, the
image of him destroying the cabinet suddenly flashed across his mind, followed speedily by
McGonagall’s stern figure in the Head Office. Harry was suddenly aware of what was happening and
he desperately tried to close his mind. Ginny’s face appeared with tears in her eyes as Harry’s heart
lurched painfully. NO! He thought savagely, NOT HER!
‘STOP IT!’ He yelled as he tried to think of something else, anything else. Gabrielle’s tear filled,
horrified eyes swam in his mind, and before Harry could stop it, a sudden flash of gold streaked
through his thoughts. 'NO!' Harry felt a sharp pain in his knees as they hit the floor. He lifted
himself to his feet, panting from the effort of throwing Snape out of his mind, and glaring at Snape,
- 83 -
he asked furiously ‘What the hell are you doing?’
Snape was even paler than usual and his eyes looked almost possessed as he spoke.
‘You are still hopeless at Occlumency.’ He said, his voice dripping with contempt. ‘You will fail
Potter, because you are clueless and lazy.’ Then he flicked his wand, but Harry was ready for it. He
threw himself behind the chair. The curse hit the back of the fireplace, sending soot billowing into
the air as Harry desperately felt for his wand. Snapes snide voice rang out ‘Luck will not save you in
the end.’ It sounded as though Snape had retreated back to the kitchen. ‘Only a great wizard can
defeat The Dark Lord!’
Harry’s fingers pulled the stick like thing towards his palm, closing over it firmly. He darted out from
behind the chair and raced towards the kitchen, arriving just in time to see Snapes twirling black
robe disappear up into the chimney. Harry slowly lowered his wand and breathlessly sunk into a
nearby chair, surveying the damage.
It was early morning before he collapsed into bed after cleaning up the mess. There were still some
telltale marks on the walls, which Harry could not mend with magic, but that was the least of his
worries. Snape had made it clear something terrible was going to happen, something that might be
averted by capturing Bellatrix. But it confused Harry as to why Snape was so willing to share this
information.
Why was he sabotaging his master’s servant’s errand? Was it possible that Bellatrix was acting
alone and Snape had caught wind of it? No, Harry could think of no reason why Snape wouldn’t just
kill her himself. So why had he come to Harry? Then a thought occurred to him. Snape wanted rid
of Bellatrix because she was competition, she was as evil and as cruel as he was.
Harry had seen the Death Eaters cower before Snape on the Astronomy Tower, so he was counted
as someone to be reckoned with, and Bellatrix had described herself to Harry over a year ago in the
Ministry of Magic as Voldemorts "most loyal servant". It made sense; that was why Snape had
tipped him off, he wanted Bellatrix out of the way.
Harry felt a certain amount of satisfaction at the thoughts that they were fighting amongst
themselves, though there remained of course, the possibility that this was still an elaborate trap of
some kind. But he could not take the risk and try opening the parchment now, nor could he ignore
the possibility that Snape was telling the truth, not if Hogwarts was in danger.
Snapes words repeated, over and over in Harry’s head as he lay in the dawn’s light. He knew
Occlumency was important for him, especially now. He was hiding such an incredible secret, that
should it get back to Voldemort, all hope would be lost. If Voldemort knew someone had
successfully destroyed the ring Horcruxe already, and that the locket was currently in Harry’s
possession, then he would reinforce his security around the remaining ones, making them
impossible to obtain, not to mention he would hunt Harry down with a renewed urgency.
It bit deeply that Snape was right about him. Harry had none of the power Voldemort had. Luck was
the only reason he had escaped him in the past. He still struggled with the most basic of things,
non-verbal spells. As he rolled over trying to shut out the morning’s light, he came upon a decision;
after he had destroyed the locket he would return to Hogwarts and work ruthlessly to become the
wizard everyone believed him to be.
~*~*~*~
Over the next few days Harry stayed in contact with Ron and Hermione via the message log. The
speech was necessarily cryptic in case someone should come across one of the books, though Harry
had nothing of importance to report since finding the locket. As each day passed his notes were
becoming shorter and more impatient sounding, until on the fourth morning all he wrote was one
sentence to say nothing new had happened. Hermiones notes on the other hand were far more
detailed.
It seemed she and Ron had started the Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons at McGonagall’s
- 84 -
instructions, but had found they were struggling to keep order amongst so many students. In fact,
Hermione had sounded rather flustered upon returning from a two-hour session on his third day at
Grimmauld place, saying that they were only still doing it because McGonagall wouldn’t let them
quit. As for the shared Common Room, Hermione had written that things had taken a turn for the
worst since he had left and Blaise Zabini in particular had become extremely antagonistic.
Harry felt a pang of sympathy for his two best friends, but he found little time to wonder at the
goings on at Hogwarts. He had bent all of himself to the task of figuring out what to do next. He had
tried to open the locket by force and failed miserably, even resorting to throwing it in the fire to see
if it might magically spring open. But nothing prevailed, so his mood sank deeper with each passing
day out of frustration and impatience.
The Order members who dropped in from time to time to check on him during their guard would not
discuss why Lupin had not yet come back, though Harry began to suspect he was working
undercover amongst the werewolves once more, an extraordinarily risky thing to do after he had
been present at the struggle with the Death Eaters at Hogwarts; a fact Harry would bring up with
him the minute he returned.
The fact that Snape had seen Ginny in his thoughts when he had invaded his mind, also weighed
heavily on Harry. It was exactly the kind of thing Harry had desperately hoped to avoid and yet
because of his lack of skill, and his increasing need for her, it had come to pass anyway. The more
Harry thought about it the darker his thoughts became, and his growing unease and frustration
meant sleeping was becoming more and more difficult.
On the fourth day Harry was sitting in the kitchen as he did everyday, staring at the locket on the
table before him, feeling utterly useless, when he heard Sirius’s mothers portrait start up. He hastily
snatched the locket up and placed it in his pocket before hunching himself over his cold, half empty
mug of tea. He heard footsteps coming down the stairs, and as they neared Harry resentfully hoped
whomever it was would drink their tea quickly and leave. He didn’t look up as they stopped at the
foot of the stairs. Mrs. Black was still ranting in the distance as whoever it was made their way over
to the table, and then Harry felt a slender hand on his shoulder.
He looked up expecting to see Tonks, but instead he looked straight into Fleur’s slightly watery
eyes. It was a meeting Harry had been silently dreading since the morning after her and Bills
wedding. Even though Harry knew he wasn’t responsible for what happened to Gabrielle, he couldn’t
help think that it wouldn’t have happened if not for him. He had wondered if she would ever be able
to bring herself to be in his company again, and part of him almost hoped that she wouldn’t.
She leant down and kissed him gently on the cheek. ‘Eet ‘as been too long ‘Arry’ her voice was soft
though heavy with emotion. Her smile as she looked down at him did not reach her eyes ‘You 'av
been avoiding me perhaps?’ Harry quickly looked down at the table ‘No’ he forced. Mrs. Black was
finally silent again as Fleur continued.
‘Arry, we ‘av been friends for a long time now, and I feel I can be honest weeth you.’ She pulled out
a chair next to Harry and swung it round to face him. He stared at the table intently and did not
look up.
‘Theengz were very ‘ard for my family after what happened, and eet was eezy to blame you
because we needed someone to blame.’ Harry’s swallowed the pain that leapt from his stomach ‘But
it did not take us long to realize our mistake, and Bill ‘as been working very ‘ard to find zee culprit,
zee real person oo deserves our ‘atred.’ Harry’s head swung round as he looked at Fleur ‘Dis …
Bellatrix,’ she almost spat the name ‘she will feel zee consequences of ‘er actions very soon.’
Harry frowned ‘What d'ya mean?’ he asked cautiously.
‘You will zee,’ Just then Bill appeared through the doorway and smiled crookedly at Fleur through
his scarred face. ‘And when ‘ee catches up with ‘er she will wish she never crossed a Delacour.’ Her
eyes glittered with revenge. Harry was frowning intently as he turned his attention to Bill.
‘What’s going on? Have you found Bellatrix?’
‘Cant say, Order business.’ He said flatly. Harry dropped his eyes searchingly to the table. He knew
- 85 -
the Orders hatred of Bellatrix was likely to place them all in a great deal of danger, and he was
already sitting on a way of getting to her. But he had no way of convincing them of that without
telling them about Snape, which would then render the plan useless. He stood up and looked Bill in
the eye, determined to get an answer.
‘I have to know Bill’ he said slowly ‘How close are you to getting to Bellatrix?’ Bill sighed and closed
his eyes for the briefest moment before answering him.
‘I know what this means to you Harry, but I cant-'
‘No you don’t! You don’t have a clue what this means to me.’ Harry said loudly. ‘I will not be pushed
out of the loop on this one. Tell me how long until you move in on her?’ Bill looked taken-a-back by
Harry’s aggressiveness, but it was Fleur who spoke first.
‘I theenk ee deserves to know.’ She said to Bill as she lifted her hand and touched it to Harry’s arm
‘Ee ‘as suffered as much as anyone else ‘as because of ‘er.’ Harry stared stony eyed, waiting for Bill
to speak.
‘I can’t tell you Harry, you know the oath I took.’ He said gravely ‘Though I promise to bring it up
with Lupin when he gets here tomorrow.’
Harry knew it was useless to push the point, so he slumped back in his chair and rubbed his face in
his hands.
‘You look terrible,’ Fleur said as she took his cup away. ‘You ‘aven’t made yourself a proper meal the
whole time you’ve been ‘ere, I expect.’ She stood up and walked to the cupboards ‘I’ll make us
some lunch.’
‘I’m not hungry, I already ate’
She turned and eyed him shrewdly ‘I theenk dis eez not true’
‘She cooks an excellent shepherds pie’ Bill chimed in hopefully.
‘No, really,’ Harry got up and walked to the stairs ‘I’m not hungry.’ then he turned and made his
way up the stairs and into the drawing room, closing the door behind him.
He removed his obsession from his pocket, holding it before him. The lack of sleep and sheer
frustration he had experienced over the past few days proved a volatile mix and he squeezed the
hateful Horcrux in his fist, turning his knuckles white.
Why had Dumbledore entrusted this task to me? He thought angrily. What could he do against such
magic? He wasn’t a great wizard as Snape had so eagerly pointed out. His chest heaved as the heat
in him rose. He didn’t have the experience or the knowledge to deal with this. He thought savagely.
If it wasn’t enough that Dumbledore had made the unforgivable mistake of trusting Snape, he had
also erred beyond the ridiculous entrusting the destruction of Voldemort to him.
Harry let out a heated roar, and with the strength that could only come from utter rage, he pulled
his arm back and threw the locket across the room. It hit the Black Family tapestry hard and
bounced off, falling to the ground as solid as ever.
Harry yanked out his wand and pointed it at the locket. How could the fate of the wizarding world
be resting on his shoulders? ‘Alohomora!’ Harry said through gritted teeth, feeling utterly useless.
Nothing happened. How could Dumbledore have been stupid enough to believe in him? ‘Open!’ he
said angrily as he walked up to it. He eyed the serpent engraving, repulsed by its link to Voldemort.
He was going to fail. Harry knew in his heart that Snape was right. He was beyond caring who heard
him as he yelled with blind fury at the golden snake ‘OPEN!’
A hissing sound came out of Harry’s mouth and a rumble like thunder grew from the locket, shaking
the room. It reached a deafening level as Harry backed away from it, before there was an enormous
boom and the locket sprang open.
There was a blinding flash of pale pink light and an unbearable wave of heat as Harry was lifted off
his feet and flung backwards. He was slammed into the wall behind him with incredible force, and
then just as helplessly, he was dropped onto his stomach like a rag doll, barely conscious.
His skin was painfully blistered and burned as he struggled to get breath into his lungs. He was
unable to move as his eyes looked across the floor and found the locket lying open and blackened
- 86 -
under the burnt shell of a chair. His ears rang and his head pounded, and he spluttered as the air
returned to his lungs, finally giving in to the encroaching darkness.
11. A Lead and A Familiar Face
Harry slowly opened his eyes. His body was drenched in sweat and his head swam dangerously as
he lifted it off the pillow groggily, trying to get his bearings. In the dull night-light, Harry could see
the familiar blurry sight of the Hogwarts hospital wing. He did not wonder at what had brought him
here.
During his hours of unconsciousness, the opening of the locket had played out over and over in his
dreams. He was burning … always burning. Sometimes the burning light that enveloped him had
merely scolded him beyond recognition, leaving him scarred and disfigured like Mad-eye Moody.
Other times Voldemort himself had appeared, springing forth from the opening locket, a green
beam shooting from his wand as he hissed threateningly.
The room lurched sickeningly as Harry tried to sit up, the sheets clinging to his damp body
uncomfortably. He fought the nausea that that swelled in him as he reached for his glasses, placing
them on his nose.
Socks was sitting at his feet; she was staring at him through her rather large green eyes, her tail
flicking lightly at the end. He reached down and stroked her head automatically as he looked around
the room. She immediately pressed her head to Harry’s palm, purring loudly, and padding up the
bed, she placed her front paws in his lap, rubbing her head against his body. He wondered how long
he had been there as he scratched behind her ear affectionately and lifted her to him, glad for the
company. It felt like days. He was stiff and heavy as if he’d been sleeping too long.
He wiped at his beaded forehead with the back of his arm and tried to moisten his dry, cracked lips
with his tongue. A light flickered outside in the hallway and appeared to be getting closer as Socks
wriggled free of Harry’s grasp and jumped off the bed, slinking away into the shadows.
‘You’re finally awake, Mr. Potter!’ Madame Pomphrey rounded the entrance, candle in hand, looking
pale yet relieved. She made her way over to the bed and put her hand to Harry’s head. ‘Thank
goodness!’ Harry watched her bustle over to a nearby cabinet and pull out an assortment of elixirs
and potions. She poured and measured, as Harry spoke.
‘How long have I been here?’ he croaked.
‘Not long,’ she said quietly ‘considering the condition you were in.’
Harry examined his raw looking hands, not wanting to think about his face.
‘Will the burns heal?’
She stopped mixing vials for a moment and turned to look at him. Harry watched her face and
prepared himself.
‘From what Bill Weasley said, the room you were standing in was completely burnt out.’ Harry
looked down at the sheets wishing Socks was still there. ‘All I can say is you must have very sharp
reflexes and an extraordinary shield charm.’ She eyed him with appreciation as she handed him a
cup of mustard coloured potion. ‘Your burns are already greatly healed. The redness of the skin will
fade completely within a week. Drink this, it’ll get rid of that dry feeling in your mouth and help you
to sleep.’
Harry waved the cup away ‘I’ve slept enough; at least it feels like it. How long have I been here?’
Madame Pomphrey lifted her eyebrows ‘A little over a week.’
‘A week?’ Harry repeated
‘You were brought here last Friday.’
‘What’s today?’
‘Early hours of Sunday morning.’ She said as she rolled back his blankets.
‘Why was I brought here and not St Mungos?’
‘You were brought here under Professor McGonagall’s instructions.’ She stopped fussing and
clamped her fingers together. ‘Whatever you were doing Mr. Potter, you are very lucky to be alive,
- 87 -
and I highly recommend that you do not attempt to cast such a spell again.’
‘I didn’t cast a spell’ he said quietly.
‘Rooms don’t just blow up of their own accord.’ She said sternly as she took the pillows off the bed.
‘You’ve got some explaining to do when you see the Professor.’
Harry didn’t want to say anything else about what had happened, so he waited for Madame
Pomphrey to finish stripping the bed around him before asking after Ron and Hermione.
‘They’ve been in every moment they can spare I would think, and then some. None of the other
students know you are here, at the Head Mistresses orders.’ she pulled out a fresh pair of pyjamas
and grabbed Harry under the arm, hoisting him off the bed. Harry was surprised at how difficult he
found it to move, but Madame Pomphrey appeared prepared as she helped him to the bathroom.
Harry stood under the shower, letting the cool water wash over his raw skin. He had destroyed the
locket Horcrux. He had seen it lying open and charred before he had passed out, but what was he
going to tell everyone when they asked what had happened?
When he returned to his newly made bed, he drank the mustard potion and slipped between the
crisp, clean sheets and before long the effort of having showered caught up with him. He slept free
of dreams about the locket and when he did finally awaken, it was to the sounds of Ron and
Hermione in the middle of an argument.
‘… He’s got a right to know Hermione!’
‘Yes, but its not a good idea to tell him right now … he’s got enough to deal with, Ron. Wait until
he’s feeling better.’ Harry kept his eyes closed and listened.
‘He’d want to know now.’ Ron said.
‘What difference will it make, Hm? He’s not going to be able to do anything about it anyway, and it’ll
just worry him sick.’ Harry's heart missed a beat as he opened his eyes.
‘What will?’ he asked heavily. Ron, who had been pacing up and down at the foot of the bed stopped
suddenly and looked at Harry with a guilty expression on his face. Hermione, who was sat in a chair
beside the bed, glared at Ron accusingly. Harry eased himself into a sitting position and Hermione
stood up and propped his pillows so he could lean back.
‘What’s going on?’ he directed his gaze at Ron who seemed like the most likely source of
information.
‘It’s probably nothing’ Ron began uncertainly ‘but the Order’s lost track of Lupin.’
‘What d'ya mean, “lost track”?’ Harry’s stomach lurched.
Ron looked hesitantly at Hermione before answering ‘He didn’t turn up last Saturday, and nobody’s
seen or heard from him in over a week.’ Harry’s mouth went dry as he frowned down at the bed
sheets.
‘He’s back with the werewolves.’
‘How do you know? Nobodies said anything’ Hermione asked.
‘They don’t have to.’ Harry said darkly as he looked back at Ron ‘What did Bill say?’
‘Not much … he just let it slip really … when he and Fleur were in here yesterday looking in on you.’
Harry shook his head ‘How could he go back there? If Greyback sees him …’ he couldn’t finish the
sentence, and he didn’t need to. Ron sat down on the edge of the bed as Hermione settled into her
chair.
‘Lupins smart, Harry.’ Hermione said, frowning ‘He knows what he’s doing.’ They sat in silence for a
moment before Ron spoke.
‘So, how did you end up a crispy critter then?’
Harry told them both what happened, and watched as their faces darkened.
‘We thought it was the Horcrux’ Ron said ‘so you managed to open it then?’
‘Yeah, only by accident.’
‘You destroyed it though mate. Accident or not, you did it.’
Hermione had said nothing; she sat staring at the floor with a grave expression on her face.
- 88 -
‘What?’ Harry prompted; suddenly worried that maybe he hadn’t destroyed the Horcrux by opening
the locket.
‘It almost killed you,’ her eyes swelled with tears as she looked up at him ‘… and there are three
more of them out there you have to destroy.’ Harry had thought the very same thing when he’d
been showering, but the sight of Hermiones growing horror made him down play it.
‘Yeah, well I made it though, didn’t I?’ he tried to smile, but couldn't quite manage it.
‘Only just’ Ron said gravely ‘I don’t think you should be doing this on your own mate.’
‘Ron’s right. The next time we go with you.’ Hermione said as she wiped at her face.
‘No,’ Harry shook his head slightly ‘Definitely not.’
‘We stayed behind this time because you asked us to, and it nearly got you kill-'
‘There was nothing either of you could’ve done’ Harry cut Ron off gravely ‘If you’d of been with me
you’d probably be dead, and then I really wouldn’t have any help.’ There was an uncomfortable
silence, which it meant they would argue the point no further, and Harry spent the rest of the
morning hearing all about the goings on at Hogwarts.
After complaining about their disastrous attempts at keeping order in their Defence Against the
Dark Arts classes with the younger students, Ron and Hermione launched into a detailed, and rather
curious description of their own Defence lessons. It seemed the new teacher, who refused to be
addressed as “Professor”, was extraordinarily grumpy, though Ron pointed out, he did know his
"stuff".
Neither of them could tell Harry what his name was as he had never bothered mentioning it,
although Hermione commented that she was sure she’d met him somewhere before. When she had
asked Professor McGonagall about him, she had raised her eyebrows and said he was from
Hogsmeade so it was likely she had seen him on occasion and that calling him “sir” would suffice,
seemingly unwilling to elaborate any further.
Madame Pomphrey ploughed Harry with various potions all that day, and he spent his last night in
hospital accompanied by Socks, who had snuck in and jumped onto his bed in the small hours of the
morning. He felt comforted by the feel of her soft fur on his fingertips, though his thoughts
constantly strayed to her mistress. Now that he was back at Hogwarts he knew he was going to
have to buckle down and learn everything he could to help him in his endeavour to face Voldemort.
He would have little time to be stewing over the things he could not have, which would be a
welcome distraction.
The following morning Madame Pomphrey instructed Harry to go straight to the Head Mistresses
office before attending any classes. He dreaded the confrontation he knew was inevitable and as he
rode the stairs to the double doors outside her office he tried to imagine the look on her face when
he told her he had nothing to say. Once at the top he knocked and waited. The doors opened and
Harry saw McGonagall returning her wand to the desk top in front of her.
‘Come in.’ she said, pointing to the chair. Harry walked forward but did not sit; instead he stood
firmly and spoke with a stony expression on his face.
‘Professor, I know what you want, but I can’t tell you what happened at Sirius’s house.’ She looked
at him over her spectacles ‘Not unless you want me to lie.’
‘There is no need to waste our time with untruths, Harry.’ The use of his first name caught Harry off
guard and he faltered slightly. ‘I did not ask you here to explain yourself’ She rose from her chair
and walked around her desk, Harry noticed she appeared to be shaking slightly ‘I have arranged for
you to start training with the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher this afternoon, that is of course,
if you are staying with us?’
She did not wait for a reply as she continued ‘It also seems Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley have
been…’she paused and raised an eyebrow, searching for the right word ‘struggling … with the
younger students. I expect you will have the situation under control when you take the classes
tomorrow.’ She stopped in front of the portrait of Dumbledore. Harry watched as she lifted a slightly
trembling hand to her glasses and adjusted them.
- 89 -
‘I am not ignorant of the fact that you are doing as Dumbledore wanted.’ she said ‘Though I will not
pretend that I approve of what is going on,’ Her eyes dropped to the floor, her usual stern façade
seemed to be crumbling. ‘I find myself in a difficult position, Harry. I am expected to give you a free
reign to do as you please, yet it seems likely to be your end.’ Harry could see the worry etched
across her face.
‘I’m sorry Professor,’ he said, suddenly feeling a great deal of sympathy for McGonagall. ‘I don’t
really have a choice in this either.’
She let out an exasperated breath and when she spoke her voice shook.
‘Oh, this is ridiculous! You are not much more than a boy and yet everyone is expecting you to be
able to-’
‘Professor!’
Harry started as Dumbledores voice cut firmly across McGonagall’s. His eyes darted up to the
painting and a pain shot through him as he looked at the now wide-awake figure. Dumbledore was
sitting straight and tall in his chair, his hands no longer folded in his lap, but gripping the padded
arms of the chair determinedly. The surrounding paintings were also startled out of their feigned
sleep. McGonagall fidgeted her hands as she half turned her head over her shoulder, though she did
not meet Dumbledore’s eyes. She turned back to Harry.
‘Be in the Defence classroom at three thirty, Potter. That will be all.’ she moved back to sit behind
her chair as Harry retreated uncertainly towards the door. As he took hold of the handle and turned
to close it, he could see Dumbledore’s grave face watching him as he pulled it to.
Harry sat through his first Potions class for the year with Ron and Hermione. Although he had
Snapes potions book, he had no wish to use it in class and he informed Professor Slughorn that he
had misplaced his old potions book and would need to borrow a school copy until he could purchase
a replacement. Slughorn handed him the copy that contained a brand new edition inside its tatty
cover; the one Harry had swapped for Snapes last year.
‘I say Harry, that’s some case of sunburn you’re sporting!’ Ernie spoke pompously. Harry saw
Hermione tense. He raised his eyebrows non-commitedly as he sliced into a shrivelled up sea
cucumber. ‘Been holidaying in the south? Fell asleep in the sun?’ he quipped with an amused glint in
his eye. Ron rolled his eyes and Hermione visibly relaxed.
‘Something like that.’ Harry felt a certain satisfaction at his less than perfect potion results.
Slughorn had approached his cauldron as if he were about to gleefully delve into a box of
particularly delicious crystallized pineapple, only to withdraw hastily at the sight of the congealed
kaki coloured gunge quivering dangerously as globulus bubbles oozed to the surface.
Afterwards the trio headed down for lunch in the Great Hall. While Ron piled his plate high with
sausages and mashed potato, Harry spooned a small portion onto his plate and picked at it
disinterestedly, ignoring the stares his still reddened appearance attracted. Neville sat down
opposite him; his eye’s flicking back and forth from his plate to Harry. He shifted uncomfortably in
his seat, obviously burning to ask the same thing on every ones mind.
‘Its not what you’re thinking Neville,’ Harry said. Immediately the surrounding chatter died, though
people still tried to appear busy with themselves. ‘I wasn’t attacked by anyone.’ Harry explained
truthfully. Neville nodded slightly and flashed an awkward smile. When nothing else was forth
coming, the talk slowly started up again and Harry followed Hermione’s glance up to the staff table.
‘Have you seen Hagrid yet?’ he asked, eyeing the empty chair.
‘No’ Hermione said ‘We asked McGonagall and she said they weren’t doing Care of Magical Creatures
this year.’
‘You don’t suppose its got something to do with that Giant attack at Trowbridge, do you?’ asked
Ron.
‘Nobody’s seen GRAWP have they?’ Harry frowned.
‘I don’t think so’ Hermione looked as worried as Harry felt. Just then, Ginny strolled up to the table
and sat down a few places from Ron. Harry caught her eye for the briefest of moments before she
- 90 -
started ladling food onto her plate whilst talking with great verve to a fellow Gryffindor sixth year.
For all intensive purposes she appeared to be in high spirits, so much so that she was attracting the
attention of those around her. Harry, Ron and Hermione watched curiously as a not-so-miniature Mt
Everest began to form out of mashed potato on her plate. It grew to an impressive height before
the girl she was talking to finally interrupted her, nodding at the mound. Ginny looked innocently
down at her plate.
‘Oh’ she said quietly, her expression dropping slowly. She still grasped the large serving spoon in
her hand and her cheeks reddened as she stared at it for the longest time, seemingly unable to look
away. Harry was on the verge of getting up to go to her when a hand fell on her shoulder. Ginny
looked blankly up at Dean.
‘C’mon’ he said as he motioned his head to the door. Harry breathed heavily as he watched her rise,
sucking in the urge to call her. Dean put an arm around her small shoulders as they walked back
out of the Hall together. Harry dropped his gaze to his own plate when they had gone from view,
aware of the pained look Hermione would be shooting at him.
Harry arrived outside the DADA classroom as instructed by McGonagall, glad to note the
passageway was empty of gawking students. He knocked loudly and then turned the large cast iron
ring-handle, pushing his shoulder against the heavy wooden door and stepping into the room.
He was just about to push it closed after him when he felt the hair on his neck prickle. Before he
could react, a beam of light sped towards him, knocking him off his feet. He hit the stone wall with
a thud, and then winded, he slid down it slowly onto the floor. A course grunt sounded and Harry’s
heartbeat raced, his wand already in hand.
‘You’re dead.’ the gruff voice said shortly. A hand reached down and grabbed him under the elbow,
helping him to his feet. ‘It’s a wonder you’re still alive, walkin’ around so blindly.’
When Harry got to his feet, the rather hairy old man, dressed in grey flannel robes and a grumpy
scowl on his face, turned and walked to the front of the room. Harry knew immediately where
Hermione had seen this man before. It was the barman from the Hog’s Head.
‘I wasn’t ready…’
‘Precisely my point!’ he growled as he reached the desk and turned, perching himself on the edge of
it. ‘There’s no need for me to be waistin’ my time teachin’ you, if you’re going to walk around with
your head up your … well’ the man eyed Harry as he began walking forward.
Harry’s heart sank, Snapes words echoed through his mind as he swallowed ‘I know … you’re right.’
Harry said slowly ‘Luck is the only reason I’m still alive.’ Bitterness laced in his voice.
‘Luck?’ the man had an almost amused look on his face ‘Think you’re lucky do ya?’
‘That’s not what I meant,’
‘Ah, feelin’ sorry for yourself then?’
Harry was getting the distinct impression nothing he said would be right. ‘No, I just…’ he paused.
‘What? Just want to be left alone?’
‘No’
‘Just wish it would all go away?’ the man taunted.
‘No!’ Harry said, getting increasingly impatient. ‘I…’ Harry struggled.
‘Want people to realize you’re not as good as they think you are?’
‘NO!’ Harry said loudly ‘I JUST WANT TO BE READY!’ he yelled angrily before he could stop himself.
The man leaned back slightly and folded his arms; a crooked smirk was just visible underneath his
wiry beard as he gave Harry an appreciative look. Harry’s chest was heaving, he was intensely
irritated by this mans demeanour.
‘Right! Let’s get started, then. First thing …’ the man unfolded his arms and stood opposite Harry.
‘You need to learn to control yourself.’
Two hours later, Harry left for the Great Hall feeling utterly drained. He had been under a constant
- 91 -
barrage of unusual comments and criticisms from the gruff man as they had practiced-duelled, and
every time he had let his anger get the better of him, he had found himself on the floor. Most of the
students were already sitting down to dinner, but Ron and Hermione were nowhere in sight. He sat
down next to Neville, who was gulping down chicken soup, and enquired after them.
‘I don’t know, Harry. One minute they were sitting in the common room, chatting to Ernie, the next
they went rushing out the portrait hole.’ He had a worried look on his face. ‘Are you alright?’
Harry let the hot soup drip off his spoon. ‘Yeah, just tired.’ He got a couple of mouthfuls down
before almost falling face first in the rapidly cooling broth. He gave up trying to eat and headed
back up to the Gryffindor tower, climbing into bed after discovering Ron and Hermione were still
nowhere in sight.
He awoke in the dark sometime later, someone shaking him urgently.
~*~*~*~
‘Harry! Wake up!’ Ron whispered hoarsely ‘Harry!’
‘What?’ Harry had been so weary when he retired that he was having a lot of trouble rousing
himself.
‘C’mon’ Ron pulled at his arm.
‘What?’ he said groggily as he yanked his arm out of reached, not at all feeling like getting up.
‘Just get your butt into gear and come downstairs,’ Ron said seriously and retreated behind Harry’s
drawn curtains. Harry tossed the covers off and threw his feet on the floor. He sat there for a
moment, ruffling his unkempt hair, trying to shake off his stupor.
‘C’mon!’ Ron urged from the doorway
Harry sighed impatiently and stood, slipping his feet into his sneakers and throwing on his dressing
gown. The curtains were drawn around every bed except Ron's, which showed no signs of having
been slept in at all. Some heavy breathing and the low rumbling of a snore sounded across the
room as Harry scuffed along the floor. Treading heavily down the stairs to the Common Room, he
arrived at the bottom to find Ron and Hermione sitting alone by the fire.
‘You look terrible...’ Hermione said with a frown as Harry dragged himself over to them.
‘Thanks’
‘Well go on then.’ Ron said looking at Hermione and motioning his head at Harry. Hermione
continued to eye Harry with a frown, but said nothing. Harry stood there with his hands shoved in
his gown pockets looking from one to the other. His gaze finally settling on Hermione.
‘What?’ his curiosity making him feel more awake the longer it took for them to spit it out.
‘I think I might know where to start looking for the cup.’ She said with uncertainty. Harry
immediately felt a jolt that would normally have made all traces of sleep leave him, but he was
utterly worn out.
‘Wha … How?’
‘We were talking to Ernie earlier this afternoon. He started asking about your burns,’ Ron said.
‘He was going on and on about sunburn, saying he’d never suffered from it,’ Hermione spoke rapidly
‘but that Zach had a really bad case of it years ago when he’d been on holiday in Italy. Apparently
he did it two days into the trip, and Ernie said it was even worse than yours.’ Hermione winced ‘Said
he spent the rest of the holiday, holed up inside his suite.’
‘Prat.’ Ron said.
‘You remember Zacharias, don’t you, from the DA?’ she asked Harry.
‘Yeah’ Harry remembered Zacharias rather well. He had been an obnoxious character, who had
managed to put almost everyone in the DA offside in their very first meeting at the Hog’s Head.
‘Well, apparently his and Ernie’s parents are really quite friendly, have been for years … you know,
both being from old wizarding families, both being primarily Hufflepuff students, and so on.’ She
- 92 -
said ‘They go to each others dinner parties and birthdays, they even holiday together on occasion,
like when they went to Italy.’
‘What’s this got to do with the cup?’ Harry prompted, feeling not all together happy about being
woken up to hear about Zacharias' and Ernie’s holiday mishaps. Hermione’s fingers were fidgeting
with the corners of a large, tan coloured book that lay in her lap.
‘Do you remember the name of the woman Tom Riddle killed, to get the cup?’ she said quietly.
‘Yes, Hepzibah. Hepzibah Smith, why?’ The memory from the pensive was still vivid in his mind.
‘Well, you remember she said she was a descendant of the original Hufflepuffs, which is why she
had the cup in the first place?’
‘Yes…’
‘Zacharias' a Smith too.’ Ron injected.
‘Exactly.’ Hermione said.
‘But … there must be hundreds of Smiths in the wizarding world.’ Harry said doubtfully.
‘There are…’ Hermione said slowly.
‘Great, so how does this help?’ Harry said, getting a little frustrated that he was still none the wiser.
Ron said interestedly ‘Hermione remembered reading about the founders of Hogwarts in, Hogwarts,
A-'
‘Hogwarts, A History, yeah I know, she must know that book off by heart, by now. I still don’t see
what you’re getting at.’ He said impatiently. Harry then turned to Hermione. She appeared slightly
hurt and wouldn’t look at him, instead she watched Ron who had tensed visibly. He frowned at
Harry.
‘I think it would be a good idea if you just heard her out, mate.’ There was silence between them as
Harry and Ron stared at each other. Harry knew he had been harsh, and that his friends were trying
to help him, so he breathed in his irritation.
‘I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that.’ He said quietly. Hermione nodded ‘I’m just tired.'
She eyed him with concern as she continued. ‘Well, I thought it might be worth tracing the Smith
families, there was nothing recent enough in Hogwarts, A History, so Ron and I searched for hours,
and when the library closed we brought the books back here so we could keep looking and it seems
that Zacharias' family is related to the Smiths that are the descendants of Hufflepuff.’ Hermione
lifted the book and showed Harry the cover. ‘I found a reference to them with some more help from
Ernie. And Harry, they are the only Smiths left from that line.’
Harry glanced down at the cover. THE HUFFLEPUFFERS A look at Graduates, Volume XII was
inscribed in large grey lettering, above the badger symbol always associated with the name.
‘I still don’t understand. So what if he is? The cup was taken by Voldemort, the family doesn’t have
it anymore.’
‘Harry, when Voldemort made the Horcruxes, he made them out of “trophies”, things that were
meaningful in some way.’ Hermione explained ‘Dumbledore said so himself, didn’t he?’
‘Yes,’ Harry was feeling like they were getting nowhere and his patience was wearing thin, and his
head had started to hurt. ‘But I don’t see how that will help us find it. He could have put it
anywhere-’
‘Just give her a chance, mate.’ Ron cut in seriously, holding a hand out in a silencing gesture. Harry
swallowed, he had no idea why, but his anger had been steadily building.
‘Think about where Dumbledore found the ring, Harry.’ Hermione said abruptly, obviously getting
slightly irritated now too. Dumbledore said he had taken the ring from Marvolo’s place.
‘Riddle hid it at his grandfathers.’
‘Yes.’ Hermione said pointedly ‘He chose to hide it there because he thought it was a fitting place.
The ring was a Slytherin heirloom, so he put it in the last Slytherin house.’
Harry narrowed his eyes as he started to make the connection. ‘So the cup…’ he said slowly.
- 93 -
‘Is probably hidden somewhere that has significance to Hufflepuff.’ finished Ron.
‘Which is where Zach comes in,’ Hermione said ‘its just possible his family are sitting on the site of
one of Voldemorts Horcruxes. Not particularly likely, I’ll admit, but possible.’ She gripped the sides
of the book firmly. ‘He could show us the properties his family own, and he’d be able to find out
from his parents if there are other places that are important to them.’
‘How are we going to do it?’ Harry said raising his shoulders ‘He’s not exactly a good friend of ours
is he? And he hasn’t returned to school this year either.’
‘And he’s a right nosy git too.’ Ron added ‘He’ll want to know why we’re poking around.’ Hermione
was staring at the book in her lap.
‘I might be able to get him to show me. And without having to answer too many questions.’
‘How?’ Ron asked.
Harry thought Hermione looked decidedly uncomfortable as she spoke. ‘Its just an idea, but I could
use a love potion on him.’
‘What? What for?’ Ron screwed his face up.
‘Well, if he thinks he’s in love with me, he’ll show me pretty much anything I ask him to, wont he?’
she said. Ron’s mouth started to move, but nothing came out.
‘No Hermione, that’s not a good idea.’ Harry frowned ‘You didn’t see Ron last year after he ate one
of those chocolate cauldrons Romilda spiked.’
‘If you can think of another way of getting what we want, then I’d like to hear it.’ She said, raising
her eyebrows.
‘We’ll just ask him,’
‘That’s not an option, Harry’ Hermione shook her head ‘You know what he’s like, there’s no way he’ll
do it without asking a million questions, and even then, he’d probably refuse. No,’ she shook her
head ‘there’s no other way.’
‘You’re not doing it!’ Ron finally spoke
‘I’ll make sure the potions fresh from Fred and Georges so it wont be too strong.’ She went on
determinedly, not looking at Ron ‘and I’ll do it bit by bit, so it wont be suspicious.’
Harry was deep in thought, searching for another way they could approach Zach, but try as he
might, Hermione’s idea seemed like the best answer. ‘I’m just not keen on you doing it Hermione,
what if something went wrong?’
‘I’ll be careful Harry, don’t worry, I’ve no intention of getting myself in too deep.’
‘What if he gets … frisky?’ Ron scowled.
Hermione rolled her eyes and sighed impatiently. ‘I can handle Zacharias Smith. Anyway,’ she
stood, still clutching the book ‘it’ll be dawn in a few hours and we’ve got Defence classes to teach
this afternoon. I’m going to get some sleep, and I suggest you two do as well.’ She crossed the
room, turning before she headed up the stairs ‘Especially you Harry. You really do look terrible.’ She
paused as she studied him for a minute, and then mounted the stairs stifling a yawn.
‘I don’t like it’ Ron said flatly.
‘There’s a surprise’ Harry said dryly.
‘Really, remember what Slughorn said about obsessive love being dangerous!’
‘Yeah, but if anyone can do this, its Hermione, she’s very thorough.’ He replied as they headed back
up to their beds. ‘I’m not really keen on the idea either, but I don’t think we have a choice. We have
to find that cup, and this is the best lead we’ve got … the only lead we’ve got.’
The next day, when Harry wandered into the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to take the first
lesson of Defence for the younger students, he had to fight the overwhelming urge to turn around
and walk out again.
The Hall itself was orderly enough, with desks placed exactly how Hermione had laid out on the
piece of parchment she had thrust into his hand before entering. The students however, were in
supreme disarray. There were a few frightened looking first years sat at their desks, but the rest of
the hall was littered with small house groups of boisterously chattering students, milling around one
another, some taking great pleasure at casting noisy jibes and scowling looks at those from houses
not their own.
- 94 -
Harry stopped just inside the doorway.
‘I don’t think they’ve seen us yet’ Ron leaned in to Harry ‘Wanna make a run for it?’
‘Coward’ Hermione said as she shot him a slightly amused glance.
As tempting as it sounded, Harry swallowed and walked determinedly to the teacher’s table. As he
made his way through the rabble, Ron and Hermione in tow, the student’s heads began to turn. It
was almost as though Harry was casting a Silencio charm in his wake. The din died out behind him
as he passed, and the silence stretched across the room, until he had reached the step up to the
table. When he finally turned to the students, there was complete silence.
‘There’s advantages to being the "Chosen One", isn’t there?’ Ron said, hardly moving his lips as he
and Hermione pulled up along side him. This was far more nerve racking than Harry had imagined
it, and as he gathered his wits, he wondered how on Earth he had let McGonagall put him in charge.
He stood tall, lifted his head and took a deep breath. ‘Right’ he said out of the corner of his mouth
to Hermione ‘off you go.’
Hermione looked at him dumb struck for a moment, before regaining her composure and flying into
Head-Girl mode. Harry could hear Ron suppressing a laugh as she gave instructions in an
abnormally high voice, the students continued to stare at Harry, slowly taking their seats.
‘There’s something to be said for awe, isn’t there?’ said Ron under his breath, obviously enjoying
himself.
Hermione turned on him ‘Oh, shut up!’ then she looked at Harry ‘you cant just stand here looking
impressive, this is your class remember?’ And she promptly sidestepped so that Harry was left
standing before a sea of expectant faces. As he looked out at them, wondering how he had
managed to get roped into this, it suddenly occurred to him why he was here.
McGonagall had chosen him not because he knew the subject, or because he was necessarily a good
teacher. He was there because she knew the students would listen to him; she knew they would
want to learn from him. The responsibility of it finally hit home. He looked down at the piece of
parchment he held in his hand, finely detailing the tasks each year was to undertake, and scrunched
it closed in his fingers.
‘Third, fourth and fifth years will be learning the shield charm.’ He announced resignedly. There was
an immediate smatter of excited gasps as Harry continued, thinking of Hermiones gaze that would
most likely be boring into his back. ‘Split into pairs of mixed ages and houses to practice.’ A low
murmuring swept across the room as students turned to look at one another.
‘First an Second years will start learning some of the basic hexes that can be used if you find
yourself in difficulty.’ This seemed to go down particularly well with the younger students who
normally couldn’t hope to be learning such things before their fourth year. Harry turned, preparing
himself for Hermiones disapproval, but was surprised to see her smiling at him.
‘I’ll take the first and second years until you can get round to them.’ She said and proceeded to
instruct them out of their seats and herd them into a clearing at the back of the hall.
‘She took that well.’ Ron gave Harry a wry smile.
The session went well, though it was not without incident. There was some much expected
squabbling over who didn’t want to be paired with whom before they started, and also not
surprisingly, quite a lot of over zealous hexing going on in both groups.
The kid that had been determined not to be in Harry’s compartment on the Hogwarts Express a
fortnight ago, called Hunter, seemed extremely resentful at having been forced into Harry’s
company once more, making no attempt to hide his agitation. Harry ignored the boy’s backhanded
attempts to convince others they were foolhardy to the extreme to be seemingly happy about the
close proximity of Harry.
That is, until he overheard Hunter telling the freckled, curly-haired kid Harry quite liked named
- 95 -
Peter Taphet, that if he were a faithful Death Eater, he thought it less likely he would come across
the Dark Lord than if he was standing in the same room as Harry Potter. That was all he could take.
Harry calmly leaned in to Hunter and told him in a quiet voice that he would make sure he took the
time to introduce the “Dark Lord” to him the next time Voldemort dropped by to attack him.
Hunter did the rest of the lesson in silence.
When the trio finally retired back to the Common Room, Harry took out Snapes potion book and
flicked through it, looking for any spells he missed last year, while Ron and Hermione collapsed into
a chair together, quietly arguing over Hermiones plan to drug Zacharias with Love Potion.
At dinner, Harry shoved his beef casserole around the plate, and then left five minutes after he had
sat down, heading for the owlery. He hadn’t seen Hedwig since he had arrived at Hogwarts, and
started feeling rather guilty for neglecting her. He wanted to send for a new potions book from
Flourish and Blotts anyway, and he knew Hedwig would be glad for something to do, and as he
climbed the stairs, his thoughts turned to Lupin.
As much as he was clever, it seemed unlike him to disappear from all contact for so long, especially
now he was head of the Order and they relied on him for leadership. Harry wished it were as easy
as sending him an owl, but he knew he couldn’t. There was nothing he could write in a note that
wouldn’t prove incredibly dangerous to Lupin if it was intercepted, so he made up his mind to go to
The Burrow the following night and speak to Mr. Weasley and find out what they were doing to find
him.
Hedwig ignored Harry’s first attempts at coaxing her down to him, keeping her back to him, with
her beak in the air. She finally relented when Harry made to leave, fluttering down to him and
perching on his arm. He stroked her smooth feathers fondly, moving over to one of the gaping
windows and looking down at the grounds. Hagrids hut was still in darkness, and Harry felt a
familiar knot in his stomach. He had no idea where either Lupin or Hagrid were, what they were
doing, if they were okay, or even alive, though he told himself they were, convincing himself he
would know if they weren’t.
He turned as he heard shuffling from the stairwell, a second later Ginny appeared carrying a bag of
owl treats. Harry’s body reacted with a jolt of pain as his heartbeat quickened. Ginny, who had been
watching her feet, looked up slowly, and when her eyes met Harry’s she flashed an awkward smile.
Hedwig launched herself off Harry and headed straight for her, landing delicately on her arm. Pig
also zoomed down from his perch and took up position on her raised hand. She shooed them off
gently.
‘How are you feeling? I mean…’ she waved a hand at her face, indicating she was talking about his
burns.
‘Its really good’ Harry knew as soon as he said it, it sounded ridiculous considering how he looked. ‘I
mean ... its better.’
She nodded, as her eyes appeared to become excessively watery. ‘I’ve been coming to see her,’ she
motioned to Hedwig who sat eyeing the owl treats ‘I thought she might be lonely.’ She frowned.
‘Thanks’ Harry said ‘I don’t always have the time.’
‘I know,’ There was a long silence as Ginny stared at the floor.
‘So how’s Dean?’ it was out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop himself. Ginny looked up at him
and her eyes closed briefly. She looked back at the floor, shaking her head softly.
‘I’m sorry’ Harry said stupidly ‘I-I shouldn’t have asked, it’s none of my business.’ He actually felt
sick as he watched a tear drop down her face.
‘I can’t believe you’d ask me that.’ Her voice was strained.
‘Ginny … I’m sorry. It was stupid of me.’
‘He told me you’d do this, he warned me … but I didn’t believe him, I didn’t believe it of you.’ Her
voice shook and Harry thought he had never seen her this upset. He felt racked with guilt and
cursed himself for not having more self-control. He could think of nothing to say in his defence, so
he stood there helplessly.
- 96 -
She turned suddenly and was gone.
Harry left the owlery and headed back to the Common Room. The passageways were clear as he
stalked through them, the anger and frustration surging uncontrollably within. He climbed through
the portrait hole and headed straight to the dormitory. When he arrived, he didn’t bother to put a
light on; instead he sat in the dark, on his bed, and waited...
Finally, the door creaked open and Harry watched as a figure emerged, the lamp flickered on and
Seamus strolled over to his bed, unaware of Harry. He dug about in his trunk, throwing clothes
around with his back to him. A minute or two later Dean walked through the door.
‘Have you found-’ before any more words were out of his mouth, Harry had lunged at him and
grabbed the front of his robes, throwing him up against the wall.
‘What the hell?’ Dean gasped.
‘Harry!’ Seamus’s startled voice rang out.
‘What did you say to her?’ Harry roared.
‘What?’ Dean breathed, looking terrified.
‘Ginny!’ Harry pressed him against the wall with renewed force. ‘What have you been telling her?’
Harry could feel Seamus trying to pull his arm away.
‘Harry! Cut it out!’
Harry turned his head to him ‘Butt out Seamus!’ Seamus backed off slightly.
‘What are you talking about?’ Dean asked urgently.
‘Don’t pretend you don’t know. All I did was ask her if things were okay between you two and she
fell to pieces. I want to know what the hell is going on!’ Harry said furiously.
Dean dropped his head back against the wall in understanding. ‘She’s upset at you, not me’ he said
more calmly.
‘Why? What have you been telling her?’
‘Harry!’ Ron had come charging through the door ‘Harry, think about what you’re doing.’ He said
urgently. Both Dean and Harry were panting as Harry loosened his grip and took a step back, never
taking his eyes off Dean.
‘What’s going on?’ Ron asked, looking from one to the other.
‘I knew something like this was going to happen.’ Dean said as he avoided looking at Harry. ‘Mate,
you’ve got it all wrong. Ginny was upset because I told her something like this would happen and
she refused to believe me.’
‘What are you saying?’ Harry said angrily.
Dean gave an exasperated sigh ‘I warned Ginny that you would think her and me were dating
again. I told her you wouldn’t be able to handle it. But she said you would never think that, you
would never believe she could be with …’ Dean paused as he looked at Harry ‘with someone else...’
He trailed off quietly.
12. Draco’s Return
Harry listened as Dean spoke.
Strangely he hadn’t wanted to believe it at first. He was flooded with guilt over his stupid jealousy,
so much so, he found himself desperately searching for a lie in Dean’s words. But as Dean
explained, it became obvious to him that he had made a horrible mistake.
Ginny had been helping Dean wade through the Ministry of Magic “Employee Guidelines” booklet,
apparently his sights were set on filling Mr. Weasleys old shoes in The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts
Department, at the Ministry of Magic after he obtained his NEWTs; a position that had yet to be
filled since Mr. Weasley had been promoted. Dean had doubted his suitability because he wasn’t
from a wizarding background, but Ginny had convinced him to complete his last year of Hogwarts,
telling him he would be perfect for the position, and proving a fountain of information on her
father’s old job.
- 97 -
Seamus and Ron hovered awkwardly for a while, listening, then they departed for the common
room at Ron’s suggestion, leaving Harry and Dean in an uncomfortable silence. Dean plonked
himself on the edge of Neville’s bed, obviously shaken by the altercation. It was a while before
Harry spoke.
‘I’m sorry, Dean. I had no right to attack you like that.’ He said quietly. Dean had been nothing but
a good friend to Harry over the past six years, even supporting him through Voldemorts return,
when most had refused to believe it. The fact that he had dated Ginny had completely clouded
Harry’s judgment, and instead of trusting in his friend, he had chosen to believe the worst. ‘I don’t
know why I did it.’
‘I do,’ Dean said gravely ‘I probably would have done the same thing in your position.’ Harry could
tell Dean still had genuine feelings for Ginny, but this time it didn’t stir up unwanted resentments.
‘Ginny and I are friends, Harry … good friends, and I want it to stay that way.’ Harry watched him
as he spoke. ‘If you’ve got any doubts about the way she feels … just look at her reaction yesterday
at lunch when she saw you at the table. Even Ron couldn’t have eaten that much potato!’ he
grinned slightly.
‘She’s a strong girl, Harry, but she was a mess the whole time you were lying up in that hospital
ward.’ Harry frowned, he thought no one but Ron and Hermione knew he was there. ‘Ginny forced it
out of Hermione the day you arrived.’ Dean said, following his thoughts ‘She knew something had
happened. Ron and Hermione couldn’t hide something like that from her, or the rest of us for that
matter, we’ve been friends too long.’ He held up his hand reassuringly as Harry’s frown deepened
‘Don’t worry, only the seven of us know you were there, though what happened to put you in
hospital is still a mystery.’ He gave Harry a wry smile.
‘Seven?’ Harry asked.
‘Yeah’ Dean nodded ‘Me, Ron and Hermione, Neville, Luna, Seamus, and of course Ginny’ he
counted off his fingers. ‘Just the old gang.’ He smiled.
‘Luna too?’ Harry said, feeling unusually glad for her.
‘Yeah’ Dean said sheepishly. ‘Where would we be without her regular insights into the weird and
wonderful?’ Then he stood up and put his arm across Harry’s shoulder, leading him to the door. ‘Its
none of my business, but I reckon Ginny might be wanting an apology, mate.’
Harry stopped as Dean dropped his arm and opened the door ‘Thanks … and I’m sorry.’
‘Don’t mention it’ Dean nodded and left.
Harry knew Dean was right, he had behaved insensitively and Ginny had good reason to be mad at
him. He went to his trunk and fished out the marauders map, determined to find her and try and
explain his behaviour, he couldn’t leave things like they were. He opened the parchment and
scanned it, looking first in the Gryffindor tower and then the girl’s bathroom, but her name was
absent from both. Frowning, he checked the library and the Great Hall, but there was still no sign of
her.
He registered slight alarm, as he searched the classrooms and the passageways, but Ginny was
nowhere to be found. His heartbeat began to quicken as his eyes darted over the map checking the
grounds, and then suddenly, he exhaled as a smile crept across his lips, finally spotting the small
ink dot with her name above it, in Hagrids Hut. But, just as suddenly, the smile died as his eyes fell
on a second dot in the room with her.
Harry sickened as the bile rose in his throat. The map fell from his hand as he tore out of the room,
his heartbeat racing as he leapt down the stairs three and four at a time, with only one thought on
his mind. Tearing across the Common Room, heads turned and watched him as he charged through
anyone who got in his way. He reached the portrait hole, clambering through it desperately, Ron
calling after him. There was no time to explain so he forced out Ginny’s name over his shoulder, the
only thing on his mind as he ran blindly on, panic shutting out everything but his need to reach her.
Cutting through every shortcut he could, he flew down the marble stairs and out the double oak
doors into the blackness of a moonless night. What if I'm too late? He pushed on furiously; the cold
night air blustered around him, biting through his clothing as he bolted across the lawns. He ran
towards the dull light coming from Hagrids window, then leaping up the stone steps to Hagrid’s door
- 98 -
in one bound he flung the door open. His chest was heaving and his heartbeat pounded as he
surveyed the scene before him, wand raised, searching for the target.
There was a lone candle on the table, flickering in the strong draft that wafted through the open
door behind Harry. Ginny sat with her damp cheeks glowing in the soft yellow light, she had turned
at the sudden intrusion, staring wide-eyed in shock at Harry.
‘Where is he?’ Harry said urgently as he walked slowly into the room.
‘What?’ Ginny breathed.
‘Malfoy!’ Harry said his eyes darting this way and that, making his way slowly over to her, his wand
pointing around the room. It was obvious by her reaction, she had thought she was alone. ‘I saw
him on the map. He’s here!’ Harry said, not daring to look at her for too long, he grabbed her arm
helping her firmly to her feet. She pulled out her wand and turned her head to look around the
room. It was bathed in shadow, the dark recesses impenetrable by the weak light.
‘Where is he?’ she said urgently. They continued hovering around the spot, back-to-back, searching
every shadowy area in the room with their eyes.
‘He’s hiding himself with magic,’ Harry realized ‘stand still and don’t move.’ He said and he held his
breath as he listened. There was silence for a moment, then a muffled sound, and the cane
umbrella basket just inside the doorway tipped over.
‘Harry, The door!’
It was gaping wide open, just as Harry had left it. He swore as he pulled Ginny with him, heading
carefully over to it. The sound of voices began to drift across the lawns as they reached the
entrance, barring it, though Harry realized in angry frustration, it was probably too late. He shoved
Ginny behind him and faced back into the room.
‘Ginny!’ Ron said urgently as he raced towards them. Luna, Ernie and Neville, were pulling up in
front of Dean and Seamus, their wands drawn.
‘What … is it?’ Dean panted, his robes fluttering in the strong breeze.
‘Malfoy!’ Ginny said hatefully.
‘Get the map! I left it up in the room!’ Harry yelled over his shoulder. He saw Neville turn
immediately, eventually disappearing into the darkness as he ran back to the castle. ‘Keep an eye
on the grounds, I think he slipped passed us.’
‘Where … is he?’ Hermione panted at the bottom of the stairs, her head turning along with the
others, to scan the area.
‘I don’t know, he must be wearing an invisibility cloak or something.’ Harry said ‘Ginny, get down
the stairs.’
‘No!’ She said forcefully.
‘Ginny!’ Ron grabbed her arm and yanked her down the stairs, stepping up behind Harry to help him
block the door. It seemed to take forever for Neville to return with the map, and Harry was
impatiently aware that Malfoy was probably freely making his escape. Neville finally arrived back
and handed it over Rons shoulder to Harry, panting furiously.
‘I looked … Harry … I couldn’t … see him.’
Harry had dropped the map without countering the spell and all of Hogwarts and its occupants still
stretched out across the parchment. He searched the hut, then the area around it impatiently, but
saw no sign of Draco, though Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt’s dots were moving speedily in on the
group milling around the hut. Harry shoved the map in his pocket.
‘Don’t say anything!’ he said to the others.
‘What?’ Seamus questioned as they all looked at him.
‘Just let me do the talking.’ He said quickly.
‘What’s … going on?’ Tonks had appeared out of the dark. She stopped in front of the steps, panting
from her effort.
‘Er … I thought I saw someone … from my window.’ Harry said as he pointed at the Gryffindor
tower, his mind racing ‘A Death Eater, going into Hagrids.’
- 99 -
‘What’s happened? … Is everyone … okay?’ Kingsley breathed as he came into view.
Tonks frowned. ‘A Death Eater? … In Hagrids?’
‘Yeah’
‘Alone?’ she said flatly.
‘Mm’ Harry could tell she was dubious ‘… I-I don’t know … they’re not here now … I must have made
a mistake.’ Harry knew his friends were giving him curious looks, but none of them corrected him.
‘Are you alright … Harry?’ she eyed him.
‘Yeah… I-I’ he said, struggling for something to say.
‘He was dreaming!’ Ron chipped in. They all turned at once to look at Ron questioningly, even
Harry.
‘Heee … fell asleep.’ He continued ‘And when he woke up, he ran off, so … weee ah … we followed
him’ he waved a hand at everyone’s doubtfully cringing faces. Tonks and Kingsley exchanged looks.
‘He was sleep walking.’ Ginny offered. ‘Its supposed to be dangerous to wake someone like that, so
we followed him.’ She shrugged.
‘I’ve never seen anyone sleep-run before’ Luna said interestedly and received a gentle nudge from
Dean for her effort.
‘Is everything okay, Harry?’ Kingsley asked.
‘Yeah, er … sorry.’ He said painfully. Tonks was eyeing him suspiciously.
‘You were sleep walking.’ she said in that way the he just knew she didn't believe him.
‘Er ... that's right ...’
‘Does it loads up in the dorm!’ Ernie chimed in ‘Woke me up when he was trying to get into Riley’s
bed the other night!’ Harry raised an eyebrow as he looked at Ernie, the flash of gratitude that
flared in him because he had leapt to Harry’s defence, died rapidly. ‘Scared the poor fellow half to
death.’ Ernie seemed to be uncharacteristically enjoying playing his part in the conspiracy.
‘Right. Thanks,’ Harry said, shooting him an piercing glare.
‘Well … we’ll have a look round before we go, just in case.’ Tonks was still frowning at Harry.
‘Yes, can’t be too careful. I’ll take this side.’ Kingsley nodded and headed around the hut, Tonks
taking the opposite side.
‘What was all that about?’ Dean whispered hoarsely as they all moved in closer to Harry.
‘I climbed into Riley’s bed?’ Harry said accusingly to Ernie.
‘Best I could come up with at short notice. Thought you could use the help.’ Ernie was still smiling.
‘What is going on, anyway?’
‘I’ll explain later.’ Harry sighed ‘But for now, keep it to yourselves, don’t tell anyone what
happened!’
‘I think we’d better get back.’ Hermione said quietly ‘There’s not much we can do if he’s gone.’
‘W-What was he doing here?’ Neville asked turning his attention on Harry.
‘I don’t know,’ Harry said darkly ‘but whatever it was, we interrupted him.’
Ron stepped down to Hermione and put his arm around her shoulders, pulling her to him briefly.
‘C’mon’ he motioned to Harry.
‘I’ll be up later,’ he said, his eyes dropping to Ginny, remembering why he had been looking for her
in the first place. She seemed to be expecting it and she waited until the others had set off, before
climbing the steps and following Harry back into the hut out of the wind.
Harry took the map out of his pocket and placed it open on the table. He doubted Draco would turn
up again tonight after nearly being sprung, but he would watch anyway.
‘Its cold’ Ginny shivered and went over to the fireplace and pointed her wand at the wood that laid
there. ‘Incendio!’ Orange flames erupted and almost immediately started to cast their warmth
around the room. Harry watched the golden light flicker across her intent face as she stared into the
fire.
‘I was wrong about you and Dean’ he offered hesitantly.
- 100 -
‘Yes, you were.’ She said without looking up. He breathed heavily as he slowly stepped to her,
stopping at her back. He wanted to touch her, but he didn’t dare.
‘I just … don’t think rationally when it comes to you,’ he said ‘I saw the photo of you and him at
Sirius’ and I couldn’t help it, you looked so … happy together.’
‘He’s one of my best friends, Harry.’ She said, continuing to watch the flames dancing in the
fireplace ‘And I was happy that day, not because of him, though.’ Harry’s pain was growing with the
intimacy of the situation.
‘And you’ve been spending so much of your time with him’ Harry went on, feeling the need to justify
his behaviour.
‘I’ve been helping him.’
‘I know,’ Harry said ‘I know now, and I’m sorry.’ Neither of them spoke for the longest time. They
listened to the fire cracking and hissing in silence before Harry spoke gravely ‘The worst part about
all of this is that I should’ve been happy for you.’ She turned and looked at him. ‘I promised myself
I would let go’ he went on ‘knowing it was for the best … I’m just … finding it so hard.’ he breathed
reluctantly.
‘I thought by hanging around with Dean, everyone would think we were going out.’ she flashed an
awkward smile. ‘Not you though, I thought you’d know what I was up to. I guess Dean was right, I
assumed too much.’ she paused ‘I was hoping it would help take some of the pressure off you, so
you didn’t have to keep worrying about me.’ Harry looked into her pooling green eyes.
‘The night Gabrielle was killed … when you came to me and I snapped at you to get out of the room
... I hated myself. I hated myself because that young girl had just had her life taken away from her,
and all I could think was ... what if it had been you.’ Her eyes were swelling with tears as she
reached a hand up to his face.
‘You have to stop feeling responsible for me all the time. I can take care of myself.’ She brushed her
thumb lightly over his cheek before letting her hand drop. ‘You’re making yourself sick Harry. You
don’t eat properly, you’re looking so tired all of time’ her face was full of concern ‘you cant go on
like this. You have to stop worrying about everyone else and think about yourself for a change.’
Harry dropped his eyes to the floor.
‘I’m alright, I’ve just had a lot on my mind lately.’
‘Let me help you.’ She quietly pleaded ‘I can still be here for you without you having to worry
yourself stupid, especially if I keep it up with Dean. No one has to know’ He met her gaze ‘you don’t
need to push me away. You don’t need to be so unhappy. You don’t need to be so alone.’ Her voice
was heavy as she added ‘But you do need me, Harry.’
Finally a wet tear spilled from her eye. Harry’s breathing had become strained as she spoke, the
pain twisting inside his chest. It would be so easy to abandon all his cares and pull her to him,
every part of his being wanted nothing more than to take her for himself, to enjoy all that she had
to offer and lose himself in her. He ached to let go of the pain and find that place of comfort only
she could show him.
His body trembled as he fought the urge give in, he could not forget why he had left her. If
something were to happen to her, if he was responsible for her being hurt, or worse, he could never
forgive himself. He had risked everything when he had lain with her in the past, and he would not
do it again. He took a half step back from her, fearing his own lack of self-control.
‘I can do this alone Gin. I have to do this alone.’
She looked at him almost pityingly as her tears ran freely down her cheeks.
‘You need to let go too, at least for now. When its all over, maybe then if you still want to…’ She cut
him off as she lunged forward and embraced him. His body remained stiff with resolve, though he
closed his arms about her briefly. Then he gently eased her back away from him, his expression
blank. She looked up into his eyes, but Harry forced himself to keep them free of emotion,
suppressing all his turmoil for one last-ditch effort at putting an end to it.
- 101 -
‘Its really time we grew up, there are more important things we need to be dealing with.’ He was
surprised at the sound of his own voice, it came out almost cold. Ginny’s reddened eyes dropped
from him as she nodded, but didn’t speak. She walked past him without looking at him and opened
the door.
Harry wanted to call her name, he wanted her to give him one last reassuring look before she left,
but he remained quiet as he watched her pull the door shut behind her. He walked to the table and
glanced down at the map to make sure she made it safely back to the castle. Out of the corner of
his eye he noticed a tiny dot moving near his own. His eyes fell on it automatically.
‘I think I’m going to be sick!’
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that sardonic drawl well even as the name registered.
~*~*~*~
Harry turned his head slowly, aware that Draco would already have his wand trained on him. Malfoy
hadn’t shown up on the map a moment before, and there was no way he could have come in or out,
without Harry’s knowledge.
‘How did you do it?’ Harry asked darkly.
Malfoy scoffed smugly. ‘You’d be surprised at the talents of those you despise. But then, you only
ever believed in Dumbledore, didn’t you?’ Malfoy taunted ‘your ridiculous little map won’t help you
anymore. I wont show up unless I want to be seen.’ The wind had picked up outside, and was
howling through the thatches on the roof.
‘Still doing your Masters bidding, then?’ Harry said bitterly ‘I don’t need to ask how that’s working
out for you.’ Draco had looked pale and drawn when Harry had seen him last; now however, he
looked positively ill. ‘Stumbling already!’ Harry said smoothly as he shook his head gently. Malfoy’s
hollow eyes hardened. ‘Hoping Snape will come and bail you out again, like last time?’ He goaded
recklessly.
‘Watch your mouth!’ Draco said angrily, his body shaking slightly. Harry's hand unconsciously
neared his wand. Malfoy glanced down at it.
‘DON’T MOVE!’ Malfoy yelled wildly. He appeared to be hovering on an invisible edge. He had a
crazed look in his eyes and seemed unable to keep the end of his wand from trembling. Harry
relaxed his hand away from his pocket as the wind blustered outside, rattling the windowpanes.
‘You make me sick!’ Malfoy spat ‘All that disgusting love talk between you two,’ Harry swallowed
hard, Malfoy had heard, and seen, everything that went on between him and Ginny. He felt his face
redden. ‘You think anyone’s interested in your tortured love life? You think your doing it hard
because you cant be with your stupid girlfriend?’ Malfoy’s voice was getting higher and louder. ‘You
think you know what it is to suffer? Do you? You think you know what it is to feel the pain of losing
… to really lose someone y-you … you … ’ He was bordering hysterical, and his eyes were wide and
watery. He seemed to be struggling to find the words. A realization dawned on Harry as he watched
him.
‘He killed your family!’ Harry breathed, horror struck. Draco glared at him as the wind howled
around the hut outside. ‘Didn’t he?’
Draco’s face contorted. ‘My mother...’ he said painfully. ‘He warned me. I failed him. He was right to
take her.’ His voice shook ‘He could have killed my father and me as well.’ He looked almost
possessed. ‘He showed us mercy.’
Harry felt a flood of sympathy for this shell of the boy he had loathed for so long, but it wasn’t
enough to hide his frustration at Malfoys continued loyalty to the monster that had killed his
mother.
‘Mercy?’ Harry scowled ‘He doesn’t care about you, your mother, or your father. The only reason
- 102 -
your dad is still alive is because he's in prison!’ Outside, the rain pitted itself against the windows.
‘I have been given a chance to make things right!’ Malfoy said with nervous agitation. ‘And this
time, I will not fail!'
‘You have a chance to make things right only if you turn from Voldemort, before you do anymore
harm!’ Harry said angrily.
Malfoy looked at Harry for a moment, his expression unreadable, and then all of a sudden he burst
out laughing, barely able to keep his wand trained on Harry. It was a strange, mad sounding laugh
that slowly died off as he spoke.
‘You are too much, really! You always want to be the hero, don’t you?’ he mocked ‘Think you can
turn me? Think you can make me “come over to the good side?”’ Harry watched as his expression
grew serious and he renewed his aim, he was finding Dracos instability discomforting, and more
than a little dangerous, ‘No, my path is set, Potter. Has been all my life, just like you, really.’
‘What are you doing at Hogwarts?’ Harry asked, abandoning his attempt at getting through to him.
‘Like I’d tell you!’ he said spitefully, though after a moment, his face dropped and he appeared to be
trying to read Harry’s expression. ‘I’m not here to harm anybody.’ For the first time there was no
trace of sarcasm or anger. ‘Just stay out of my way.’
‘Right,’ Harry scoffed bitterly ‘because I can trust you, cant I? I can take you at your word.’
Draco eyed Harry over his wand tip ‘It was you who destroyed the Vanishing Cabinet, wasn’t it?’
Harry tilted his head in a nod.
‘How annoyingly inconvenient of you.’ Draco sneered. ‘I had thought I could use it again’.
‘Then I’m even gladder I did it.’ Harry said. The front door was rattling along with the window pains,
from the force of the wind swirling outside the hut.
‘It doesn’t matter; I have a better way of getting in and out now. Sorry to deny you a good gloat.’
Draco was sounding like his usual self again.
‘I wont let you hurt anyone, Draco.’
This appeared to upset Malfoy greatly ‘I’ve already told you, I’m not here to hurt anyone, I’m loo-’
he stopped abruptly, his breathing ragged with fury.
‘Looking?’ Harry said sharply. ‘For what?’
‘Enough!’ he snapped ‘I'm through talking. Turn around!’
‘Not a chance’ Harry said darkly, his hand drifting nearer to his wand.
‘Just do it!’ Malfoy said impatiently.
‘I’m not turning my back to you.’ They glared at each other for a long moment. Harry was watching
Draco closely for any sign of movement. The wind continued to howl and the rain had turned to hail
as it bit against the windows and doors. Suddenly there was a loud bang behind him and Harry’s
head spun to see what was happening.
The door was swinging inwards on its hinges, revealing the inky blackness beyond. The wind had
forced it free of the latch, and hail was streaming into the hut, extinguishing the candle and making
the map fly off the table. He quickly lunged for it, as it rushed towards the flickering, dancing flames
in the fireplace, grabbing it just in time. When he looked round to find Draco, the room was empty.
Harry hastily pulled the map apart and checked it, but could see neither Draco Malfoy, nor anyone
else around the area of the hut.
Shoving the map into his pocket, he went through the door, and pulled it firmly shut after him.
Placing his arms up in front of his head to shield the worst of the hail, he dragged himself across the
dark grounds and headed through the large oak doors.
‘Potter! What are you doing?’ Filches gruff voice sounded as he made his way across the entrance.
‘Where ‘ave you been, eh?’ He was looking at Harry through narrowed eyes.
‘Doing my nightly rounds.’ Harry had stopped at the foot of the stairs. ‘Maybe you’ve forgotten, but
I’m Head Boy, which means it’s my duty to be out and about at this time of night.’
Filch looked thoroughly unimpressed. ‘You’re not supposed to leave the inside of the castle.
McGonagall’s gonna hear about this!’
- 103 -
‘Whatever,’ Harry said resignedly and turned to mount the stairs.
‘You’re not above the rules, Potter!’ Harry could hear Filch yelling after him. ‘Your going down this
year!’
Harry ignored the remarks, suddenly too tired to be angry. Once in the Common Room, he weaved
his way over to Ron and Neville.
‘Hey, What kept you?’ Ron asked ‘You’re wet!’
‘Hermione gone to bed?’ Harry asked.
‘Nah, she went to sort out some problem in the girls bathroom. It’s a bit strange, isn’t it?’ he added,
changing the subject ‘I didn’t expected Malfoy to show up here again.’
‘Maybe he’s here to target someone else,’ Neville said ‘maybe he’s here for you this time, Harry.’ he
was looking rather worried.
Harry grunted ‘I don’t think so, he is up to something though.’ Just then, Hermione appeared,
looking very bedraggled. She was soaked, head to foot, and her shoes were squelching as she
walked.
‘Did you go back outside?’ Ron said incredulously.
‘No,’ Hermione said, obviously irritated. ‘I had a run-in with Moaning Myrtle.’ She frowned at Harry
‘She hasn’t been at it in the boys bathroom as well, has she?’
‘No.’ Harry motioned his head for them to lean in, and he explained what happened with Draco.
Neville had seemed particularly disturbed by the news of Draco’s mother, Narcissa.
‘I bet it was LeStrange,’ he said as he stared into the fire.
‘I don’t know, maybe. Though I got the impression that it was Voldemort himself.’ Harry said, then
turning to Hermione, who was enveloped in an enormous amount of steam as she tried to dry her
robes with her wand, he asked ‘Do you know how he was able to be in Hagrid’s without showing up
on the map?’
‘Honestly? No. The map shows a person, even if they’re invisible, and if they are an animagus,
though I seriously doubt he has the talent for that anyway, and he couldn’t have apparated.’ She
said. Harry could tell she was mulling it over in her head.
‘Whatever he’s doing, I don’t like it.’ Ron said darkly ‘the idea of him wandering around the castle
whenever he feels like it…’ he looked at Harry.
‘I don’t either.’ Harry said, then added ‘Though I believe him when he says he’s not here to harm
anyone,’ Neville and Ron looked at him dubiously ‘not directly anyway.’
‘Lets face it Harry,’ Hermione frowned ‘If he’s here for Voldemort, its hardly going to do any of us
any good, is it?’
Harry sat in the armchair next to Rons and drummed his fingers on the armrests.
‘We’ve got to figure out what Voldemort has set him to do.’ Hermione matter-of-factly. ‘The fact
that Voldemort has placed him, of all people here, I just don’t get it, its like before, with
Dumbledore, seems to me Voldemort wants him to fail’
‘Could be another angle.’ Harry whispered ‘Draco’s fool enough to believe he is important to
Voldemort still, he’s eager to please his Master to keep what’s left of his family alive, and Voldemort
knows now he doesn’t have it in him to kill. Voldemort may have sent him back here on a task
specifically suited to him alone. Cant imagine what though.’ Harry sighed.
‘I think we should ready as many of the old DA as we can!’ Neville spoke with surprising strength of
conviction. ‘Hermione, can you make up more of those coins, for the members who left them
behind, or lost them.’
‘I suppose so,’ she said with a vague shrug.
‘How many, and how long?’ Harry picked up on the idea. Hermione saw Harry’s determination and
thought about it for a moment.
‘I’ll have to find out who’s left, and who still wants to be involved. After that, maybe a week to get
the coins organized, charmed and distributed.
- 104 -
‘All right, it’s a start’ Harry said, the he paused for a moment, frowning and asked Hermione ‘Can
you make us a batch of Felix’s Luck potion?’
‘I don’t know. It takes such an incredibly long time, I mean, even if we start now, it wont be ready
until March.’ She said.
‘I’ll lend you Snapes book, follow his instructions and it’ll come out better than ever.’ Harry was
determined to get it underway, even though it wouldn’t help them on Halloween.
‘Some of the ingredients could prove hard to get.’
‘We’ll ‘borrow’ them from Slughorns storeroom.’
‘Alright’ she sighed ‘I’ll look into it tomorrow.’
‘Good’ Harry said as he walked to the foot of the stairs ‘I’m going to bed, I’ve got another session
with Sir tomorrow.’
‘Oh, and Harry, watch out up there!’ Hermione added ‘Apparently Myrtle overheard Crabbe and
Goyle planning some sort of revenge on you, for hexing them after they attacked Ernie and Justin.’
Harry sighed ‘Tonight?’
‘No idea, just be careful!’ she said in her Mrs. Weasley way.
13. Harry's Training and Lupins Wolf
Nothing came of Crabbe and Goyle's threat, in fact, Harry rarely saw them over the next few weeks,
and as the days passed, he studied every spare moment he had, practicing non-verbal casting with
Ron and Hermione and learning advanced spells, some of which, he found in books Hermione had
pulled from the library, others his new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher taught him.
They were finally privy to the gruff old mans name when they overheard McGonagall call him Abe in
the passageway one day, though of course, the students continued to refer to him as Sir as he was
not at all the type of teacher to be on a first name basis with.
He was particularly tough on Harry during his two-hour lessons, which Harry shared with him twice
a week. Considering how old he appeared, he had a lot of stamina, even though he wasn’t
particularly nimble on his feet. He was however, very adept at firing curses and hexes Harry’s way
the minute he relaxed, or lost concentration, leaving him bruised and exhausted at the end of each
session. But he was learning to live on his nerves, gaining confidence in his reaction time and his
ability.
Ron had visited Mr. Weasley, instead of Harry because he was keen to check on his mother, who
must have been spending a lot of time alone now that school was in full swing. He stayed overnight,
and when he returned, he said Lupin still hadn’t checked in, but Hagrid was accounted for, though
Mr. Weasley wouldn’t enlighten Ron any further as to his whereabouts, he had however, promised
to let them know the minute Lupin re-surfaced.
Hermione had pointed out, that with Lupin unable to make contact, it might be difficult, if not
impossible for Bill to continue his hunt for Bellatrix. Harry was secretly rather relieved at the
thought, though he hoped daily for news of Lupins return.
Before Harry bathed, he took to standing before the mirror in the Prefects bathroom, trying his
hand at full body transfiguration. It seemed impossible for him to complete the transformation,
many times finding himself staring back at some grotesquely half formed part of his body,
wondering if he was going to have to walk the halls to Madame Pomphrey’s domain for all to see, to
return him to normal. But he persevered; often working himself so hard he would be dripping with
sweat from the shear effort of it. At meal times, on the occasions when he didn’t skip it altogether,
he never lingered at the table, downing something to quell the ache in his stomach, then resuming
his studies.
When he slept, his dreams were full of dark and frustrating images; snakes and menacing shadows,
and the people he loved, who looked completely normal one minute, laughing and chatting,
suddenly dropping to the ground lifeless, the next. One dream he had when he was still back at The
Burrow had begun re-occurring. It was always the same;
- 105 -
Sirius, his knuckles white and his body stretched out behind him, struggling to keep from being
sucked into the endless black mouth of a doorway, and Dumbledore staring wordlessly at Harry, one
arm held aloft from his flowing robes, as if in offering. Harry had the feeling if he could just reach
him, if he could get to whatever it was Dumbledore held in his hand, he would be able to save
Sirius.
But always, Harry's struggling got him nowhere, fighting uselessly and desperately against an
unseen force. Then Snape would appear, standing before them, both arms above his head, grasping
a shining object. He would thrust it down just as Sirius called Harry’s name in warning, and at
exactly that point every time, Harry would wake, his sheets locked around him and drenched in
sweat.
Day after day, he continued to push himself relentlessly. His ruthless workload took a heavy toll on
him, and his clothing began to hang loosely off his lithe body. Hermione fussed over him, but Harry
had little time to indulge her, and snapped at her motherly attempts to slow him down. Whenever
he saw Ginny, or felt her near, a resentful anguish would rise in him, reminding him of what Draco
had said, and of how unimportant his need for her was.
Harry’s Defence classes for the younger students were improving gradually; the biggest problem
still lay in them learning to work with each other. Harry had thought McGonagall had very good
reasons for trying to unite them this year, and as much as it was proving a difficult task going
against the schools thousand year old tradition, it was not impossible. In the end Harry took a leaf
out of Slughorns book and introduced an incentive.
He decided to award seven students, seven vials of Hermiones Good Luck potion at the end of the
year. This tact seemed to work almost instantly. The students took up their learning with a new
nerve and ended their out and out squabbling, though they still appeared unable to help themselves
unleashing the odd humiliating curse on unsuspecting students in opposing houses. The Gryffindor
Common Room’s atmosphere however, was stifling at times, scuffles still erupting when things
reached boiling point.
Early in the evening, on the night before Halloween, Harry was climbing through the portrait hole,
Ron and Hermione in tow, when he suddenly felt the skin on his neck prickle. He hit the floor just in
time to avoid a stray curse, and as he picked himself up, he discovered there was an all out brawl
and hex-a-thon raging before him. He was already tired and feeling more than little strung-out after
another session with Sir, so when Harry walked in on the mayhem, his patience with their situation
evaporated.
He walked passed the scuffling students unnoticed, and up to the boy’s dormitories, where he
opened every second door off the stairwell, flicked his wand, and tossed all the inhabitants
belongings onto the landings. He came across the occasional straggling student, obviously hiding
from the turmoil downstairs, and when they saw Harry tossing all their belongings magically out of
the door, they tried to put as much distance between themselves and Harry as they could,
regarding him dangerously. When he reached the room below his, he turned and clambered back
down over the debris, locking the newly emptied rooms with a charm Hermione had come across in
one of the books in the Restricted Section of the library. When he began climbing the girls to do the
same, forgetting about the fact that the stairs would convert into a slippery-dip in his anger, a quiet
voice interrupted him.
‘I’ll do it, Harry’ Hermione had stopped him with her hand on his shoulder and a worried look on her
face. He waited as she climbed the stairs and repeated his actions on the girl’s belongings, barring
anyone trying to enter the stairwells to see what was happening. By the time she returned, word
was spreading that people had been thrown out of their rooms. There was a lot of whispering and
scowling, all fighting forgotten, as many of them eyed Harry nastily in anticipation. He finally
climbed a couple of steps and turned gravely.
‘You were warned if you didn’t grow up and learn to get along, then you would be thrown together,
until you do.’ His chest was heaving angrily ‘those who’s belongings now lie on the stairwell, can
move into another room, I don’t care which. And as this is your doing that has caused this
upheaval, you will not be calling on the house elves, if there aren’t enough beds, tough!’ He said
threateningly ‘I’ve locked the doors, and they will stay locked until you change your attitudes!’
- 106 -
Hermione and Ron were watching Harry intently as a murmuring swept through the faces, growing
steadily from quietly angry protests to louder, more prominent, outrage.
‘Who do you think you are?’
‘YEAH!’
‘It was bad enough the way things were!’
‘WELL, OBVIOUSLY IT WASN’T! BECAUSE YOU STILL DON’T GET IT!’ Harry yelled furiously. All went
quiet as sparks shot out from the end of his wand as it hung by his leg.
‘This school is under threat. At anytime, Death Eaters, or worse could come marching in here and
start killing, just because that’s what they do!’ You could have heard a pin drop as Harry opened
them up to his fears, fed up at their ignorance.
‘You’re not safe here; you’re deluding yourself if you think you are.’ He glanced at Zabini, Crabbe
and Goyle, who were scowling angrily at him ‘No matter what house you are from.’ Harry was
gradually calming as he went on. ‘Neither are you in any more danger than if you were at home.
But your stupid, petty squabbling could actually get you killed. If we were attacked right now,
almost all of us would fall.’
Harry raised his wand, pointing to the ceiling ‘and the younger students in the Ravenclaw tower …
what hope do you give them if they had to stand alone? They are family too, in some cases, your
brothers, your sisters … ’ Harry’s words appeared to be sinking in. ‘you cannot pretend none of this
is happening, nor can you hide in ignorance. Voldemort is closer than you think. No one is safe.’
Again Harry eyed Zabini and his fellow Slytherins ‘Voldemort kills his own as easily and as cruelly as
he kills innocents. And if he took Hogwarts, then our school, our families, our entire future, will be
lost.’ He glared at them, waiting for some sort of backlash, but he was met with grave silence.
‘We don’t stand a chance if we can’t unite.’ The room was completely still. Harry looked at their
stunned faces, then he dropped down from the step and crossed to the portrait hole, the students
parting as if worried they might bring undue attention to themselves. He climbed through it and was
gone, leaving silence in his wake.
He was still bitterly imagining the uproar in the common room that would have ensued after he left,
when he pushed the front door of Number twelve Gimmauld Place closed behind him. Someone
must be staying, he thought, as he registered the dull glow of a lamplight, drifting up the stairs
from the kitchen. He tucked his invisibility cloak away and descended the stairs noiselessly, another
trick he was learning from his Defence teacher, who had taken to teaching him tactics for what he
called ‘keeping yourself alive before, during, and after battle’, eventually emerging at the foot of the
stairs.
‘Lupin?’
A figure was hunched over the thickly wooden table. The head turned slowly, menacingly, to look at
him. Harry grabbed the doorframe to steady himself at the shock of finding himself standing under
the gaze of a semi-transformed werewolf. Lupins upper body was heaving slowly and heavily, and
his hands were stretched out before him on the table, his long claw-like fingernails imbedded in the
wood. His robes were torn and matted with dark stains, and his bloodshot eyes glittered
dangerously at Harry.
Harry was frozen to the spot. He had not thought to note the moon was only just passed full, and
he certainly hadn’t expected to find Lupin here suddenly, when they had no news for weeks. But he
was here, and he was still partly transformed, and he was eyeing Harry in a most discomforting
way.
‘Lupin...’
Lupin didn’t move, whether due to the pain of the transforming, or the slight, but very unlikely
possibility he recognized Harry. Wincing, Harry realized the dark patches on his robes were blood.
The stench of it had hit his nose. Harry took a half step backwards as he saw Lupin's face, it was
distorted and animalistic, his mouth was bloodied and alien to Harry. He had no idea how to react,
- 107 -
so after standing there for a while, he moved slowly and cautiously, one foot at a time, into the
kitchen, keeping his eyes locked on Lupin.
Lupin did not move, just watched Harry warily with heavy eyelids. After a few uncomfortable
minutes, Harry decided to make some tea in the hopes that the normalness of the action would
settle his nerves, but as he reached for the cups, he stupidly knocked one crashing to the floor with
a shaky arm.
A vicious howl echoed through the empty stone kitchen.
Harry froze.
That was thick! He chided. When it appeared Lupin had calmed slightly, Harry resumed his slow
movements of making a pot of tea, being meticulously careful to not make any clattering noise,
which might set him off again.
Finally Harry placed the teapot and cups on the table, and then hesitantly sat down opposite Lupin,
alert to him, but not looking him directly in the eye. They must have sat there for close on an hour,
Lupin slowly losing his wolf features, his breathing becoming more natural, Harry could even hear
the sound of his bones crunching and reforming every now and then, as Lupins face contorted with
the pain, the occasional gasp escaping his lips.
It was a slow and horrible process and it pained Harry to watch his friend have to endure it. A new
appreciation of loathing and disgust for the beast that did this to Lupin, Fenrir Greyback, grew
inside of him. At one point near the end, Lupin had looked in so much agony his eyes rolled back in
his head and he let out a long strangled moan. Harry automatically reached out for his hand, whose
claws had finally retreated to fingernails, and clasped it firmly. Lupin gripped his fingers, squeezing
them painfully for a moment, and then releasing them.
It was over.
‘I made some tea.’ Harry pushed an empty mug across the table and heated the pot with his wand,
then poured them both a drink.
‘Is it always like that?’ he asked gravely.
‘If I’m lucky, and I have someone to sit with me.’ Lupin looked up at Harry from under his
eyebrows. ‘That was an incredibly dangerous thing to do, Harry. If you’d have come in only
moments before, I might have ripped you to shreds, or worse.’ Harry new he meant he might have
bitten him and turned him into a werewolf. ‘Its worse when I’m out with-’ Lupin stopped abruptly.
‘I know you’re back with them.’ Harry said darkly.
~*~*~*~
Lupin and Harry sipped at their tea. Lupin did not seem to want to elaborate on his time with the
werewolves, so Harry drew his attention to the dark stains on his robes.
‘What’s all the blood?’ He asked hesitantly.
‘Blood?’ Lupin said blankly. He followed Harry’s gaze to his chest and pulled at his robes, trying to
see what Harry was talking about. Harry watched as Lupins breathing quickened. A look of repulsion
spread across his face at the still sticky smears of blood. Turning his eyes on the table in agitation,
he muttered ‘I don’t understand’, and then looked up at Harry, frowning. ‘I can’t remember … I
thought I got back in time.’ Lupin had a pained expression on his face. ‘I-I remember … I-I think…’
Harry swallowed his hot tea hard. ‘You wouldn’t have hurt anyone. Not you!’ Fear swept across
Lupin’s face as he stared down at the blood on his chest. Harry struggled to help him remember.
‘Think! What’s the last thing you remember?’ he said, trying to hide the fear in his own voice.
‘I-I … I was …’ Lupin stumbled. Harry could tell he was in shock, already thinking the worst. ‘I-I was
- 108 -
trying to get back here … before I transformed. I was ill, didn’t think I’d make it … had trouble
seeing the path at my feet by the time I got here … yes!’ Suddenly he looked back at Harry ‘I got
back here in time, I remember. I remember standing outside and saying number twelve Gimmauld
Place! I came inside ... down here … and lit a fire in the sitting room…’
His face dropped as he glanced over his shoulder to the doorway behind him. Harry looked beyond
into the semi dark room from where he sat, a strange sense foreboding came over him so he stood
and walked slowly to the sitting room, he leaned his head in and scanned the area. The room was in
darkness, but for a faint orange glow from the dying embers in the fire, illuminating odd shapes
nearby. Harry pulled out his wand and pointed it at the hanging candelabra. As the room flickered
into light, the shadows receded, and the shapes became distinguishable.
Harry gasped, as he stared at the horror before him.
‘What?’ He could hear Lupins chair scrape along the floor behind him, as he pushed it away from the
table. He came up behind Harry and stopped for only a split second, before pushing past him and
moving swiftly to the centre of the room where he kneeled beside the broken body that was strewn
face down across the bloodied rug on the floor.
Harry realized this had been why the smell of blood had been so strong. The armchairs were both
overturned, one had been ripped and torn to shreds with sharp teeth and claws, the other looked as
if it had been sprayed with blood, smeared in an ensuing struggle. The coffee table was snapped
and collapsed in the centre, and the lounge had been thrown against the wall, a large crack in wall
above it covered it with brick dust.
Everything in the room had been violated, candles were broken and laying on the floor, cushions
with white cotton filling bursting from ragged tears littered the area, and blood streaked across the
wooden floor where it appeared the body had been dragged. Lupin was hunched over the figure
with his hand on its shoulder, pulling the torn clothing back from the bite marks. As Harry walked
silently over to them, he could hear Lupins heavy breathing and knew what he was thinking.
He had killed an Order member who had either been here already when Lupin arrived, or had
walked in on Lupin during his change. Harry crouched down on the opposite side of the body, eyeing
Lupin with a mixture of pity and fear. Lupin had his eyes closed, seemingly unable to bring himself
to turn the body over and see who it was. Neither of them spoke, as Harry exhaled and put both his
hands under the side of the body, heaving it up slowly, and letting it roll onto its back.
He looked hesitantly up at the face. It must have been an Order member he hadn’t met, for there
was nothing familiar about the bloodied face. He looked at Lupin, unsure of what his reaction would
be, and was surprised to see him staring at the face with fury. All of a sudden Lupin growled and
tossed the body face down again.
‘What?’ Harry said, immediately sensing something wasn’t right.
Lupin breathed heavily in relief, looking at Harry.
‘This was one of Fenrir’s spies! A Death Eater called Rosenberg! A thoroughly nasty piece of work.
He was used when it was necessary to have someone that wasn’t inflicted with the turning at every
full moon.’ He shook his head ‘He must have followed me back here, it seems Fenrir is still wary of
me.’ Lupin stood up and Harry followed, getting to his feet.
‘But how did he get in here?’ Harry frowned.
‘I stupidly said the location aloud when I came here to enter, the password to the door I suspect
too. I was almost out of my mind by that time. As secretkeeper Harry, I’m not restricted the same
way you are.’ He was shaking his head again ‘I left it too late to seek solitude before I turned, and
in doing so I risked Voldemort finding out where the Head Quarters is. If Rosenberg had of reported
back to Fenrir, everything would have been exposed ... eventually.’
Lupin ran a shaky hand through his hair. ‘A stupid risk that could have destroyed all the progress
we’ve made so far, not to mention the lives of everyone who comes in and out of here.’ He looked
pityingly down at the body again. ‘I imagine he tried to hide himself, but the smell of human flesh is
rather easily picked up when you’re a werewolf in such close quarters.
- 109 -
'Considering he’s rejoiced in watching Fenrir hunt first hand, even set people up for him in the past,
he should have known better. Unfortunately, he will be missed when he doesn’t check back, which
means I’m going to have some explaining to do.’ Harry’s sympathy for Rosenberg was rapidly
disappearing. ‘I’m going to get cleaned up,' Harry could tell he was disturbed by what he had done.
Lupin left the room and returned a short time later, washed and in fresh robes.
Harry helped him clean up the mess, though they still had to decide what to do with the body.
‘I think we’ll put it in one of the rooms, I’ll send for Bill and Sturgis. I need to find out what they’ve
been up to while I was gone anyway.’ Lupin said, and released a silvery patronus out of the high,
tiny slit-like kitchen window. He levitated the body and floated it up the stairs.
Harry had removed the last of the blood from the floor when Lupin reappeared and stopped at the
foot of the stairs, watching Harry as he picked the cups off the table and placed them in the sink.
‘I think we need to have a little chat, Harry.’ He said sternly. Harry looked at him blankly, and then
suddenly understood the change in Lupin. He had seen the burnt out drawing room when he was
looking for a place to put Rosenberg. ‘Leave that, and come and sit down.’ He commanded as he
walked back to the table. He stood with one hand on the back of a chair, eyeing Harry’s guilty
expression knowingly. Harry sat down with a sigh. He knew this moment was coming; he had been
dreading it ever since Dumbledore had died.
‘I think we’ve both skirted the issue of what you and Dumbledore were up to, long enough.’ He
leaned both hands on the back of the chair and glared down at Harry. ‘What ever it is you are
doing, it is proving far more dangerous than I am sure even Dumbledore could have bargained for.’
‘No it isn’t.’ Harry said flatly ‘It is exactly what he expected.’
‘I find that very hard to believe, Harry.’ He sounded angry now. ‘I have played along with this … this
thing between you two, its gone against my better judgment, but I’ve given you the room you’ve
asked for. I haven’t pressured you because McGonagall told me that you made it quite clear you
had no intentions of telling anyone what’s going on. She said Dumbledore had instructed you to say
nothing. All of this may well be true. But look at you Harry, you look tired and drawn, and bordering
on mal-nourished!’ His voice was gradually building into a quiet shout.
‘It’s clear to me, whatever it is you are doing, it is not only extraordinarily dangerous, but it’s taking
too heavier a toll on you physically and mentally. You cannot expect me to stand by and watch you
do this to yourself.’ He was frowning as he added ‘I assume you are responsible for what is left of
the drawing room?’
‘Yes.’ Harry answered, feeling his own temper rise.
‘Am I also correct in assuming you were in the room at the time it was destroyed?’
‘You are.’
They were glaring at each other, the atmosphere between them electric. Harry could feel himself
readying to do battle. It infuriated him that Lupin seemed to be insinuating he was behaving
irresponsibly. He had no idea how Harry had struggled with the weight of the task Dumbledore had
left him! It wasn’t like he didn’t know he was in over his head!
Lupin’s eyes scanned Harry’s face. He appeared to realize the reaction he was provoking, and closed
his eyes before taking a deep breath, and exhaling it wearily.
‘Enough, is enough, Harry.’ his anger slowly dissipating. He pulled the chair out and sat down with
his elbows on the table. ‘Help me to understand what’s going on.’
Harry’s anger also ebbed, aware Lupin was acting out of concern. He lifted his hand to his face and
rubbed at his forehead, wondering how to answer. He could feel Lupins eyes boring into him. He
would not lie to him, his relationship with Lupin had grown well beyond such action, and he was
only too aware Lupin would not be fobbed off with a weak excuse this time. So he decided on the
truth.
- 110 -
‘Dumbledore discovered something about Voldemort, something that no one else knows; not even
his Death Eaters.’ He said. Lupin shifted in his chair expectantly. Harry thought carefully about what
to say next.
‘If he finds out that Dumbledore knew, if he realizes what I’m doing, then I wont be able to finish
what Dumbledore started.’ He watched Lupin for his reaction.
‘Why is it so important?’ Lupin frowned through narrowed eyes. It was Harry’s turn to shift in his
seat uncomfortably.
‘Because ... it’s the difference between me killing him,’ his eyes dropped to the table, not wanting to
see Lupins reaction ‘or him killing me.’
There was a long silence as Harry ran his finger over the scratched, uneven wooden surface
unconsciously.
‘Dumbledore told you this?’ Lupins voice sounded strange, so Harry lifted his gaze to him. He
nodded his head. Lupin’s expression was grave, and also unexpectedly angry. It was a while before
he spoke again.
‘I fear that is all you have to say on the subject then?’ Lupin stood and walked to the kitchen bench.
‘Its important you understand,’ Harry said quietly, turning in his chair ‘I’d ask for your help if I
could, if I thought it would do any good.’
‘I think I finally do understand.’ He said slowly ‘But I can’t pretend that I don’t find it more than a
little frustrating.’
‘I know, but there isn’t anything else to say. The more people who know-'
‘The greater the chance Voldemort will discover what you’re up to.’ Lupin finished ‘It’s okay. Under
the circumstances it seems you might be safer doing things your way.’ He said. He was focused on
Harry with a look of grave concern. 'But remember, if you find yourself in trouble ... if you need to
call on someone, I'll be there for you, no matter what.'
Harry would have liked to say a word of thanks to his father's once best friend, but a lump had
swelled in his throat at Lupins words. Instead, he nodded before turning back to the table.
‘Why did you come anyway?’ Lupin asked as he started pulling food from the cupboard. Harry had
almost forgotten since so much had happened.
‘I left something behind that I need for school tomorrow.’
‘It might be best if you stayed the night now.’ Lupin stopped and eyed Harry ‘I’m not exactly the
best cook in the world, but it’ll be edible. And you look as if you could do with a decent meal.’
‘Okay,’ Harry stood and walked to the stairs ‘I’ll let Hermione know I won’t be back until morning.’
‘How?’
‘Fred and George’s handiwork, I’ll bring it down and show you.’
As soon as Harry reached his room he closed the door and went over to the wardrobe. He pulled the
scroll Snape had given him from his crumpled backpack. It had lain there since the night it had
come into his possession, safest well away from Ron and Hermione’s enquiring eyes. He turned it
over in his hands, feeling relieved, yet slightly nauseated to be looking at it again, before replacing
it and retrieving the small emerald message log. He wrote a brief note to advise Hermione of when
he would be back, placed it in his pocket, and then he washed up and headed back downstairs.
Lupin was appreciative of the twins seemingly endless inventive magical abilities as Harry explained
how it worked, and even though the log contained nothing anyone else could read in to, Harry was
still eager to whisk it back into his pocket after Lupins initial flick through. As Lupin stirred the pot
on the stove, Harry tried to steer the conversation to what Lupin had been doing the last few
weeks, but he would not be drawn into the subject, no matter how determined Harry had seemed.
Eventually he asked straight out what he thought Bill might have been up to, but understandably,
Lupin explained that he wasn’t able to tell him, even if it wasn’t for the oath he took, as he had had
no contact with anyone from The Order the whole time he had been underground. So Harry had to
content himself with waiting in the hopes that Bill turned up in answer to Lupins call.
- 111 -
Between reluctant mouthfuls of tinned stew, he took the opportunity to express his unease at
Lupins own situation. But as Lupin had readily pointed out, everyone was taking risks these days,
and it was a necessary price to pay if it could make a difference in the war against Voldemort.
It was the early hours of the morning by the time Harry crawled between the sheets, Bill still yet to
show. And though his mind was buzzing with the contents of his backpack, he managed to sleep
fitfully until dawn. Bill still hadn’t turned up when Harry appeared downstairs, though Tonks was
there. Harry quizzed her immediately about Bill, uncaring that his interest in him all of a sudden
appeared suspicious. He was bizarrely comforted by the fact that Tonks was adamant Bellatrix was
still at large, but was unable to get any further information from her. She was somewhat
preoccupied, and Harry noticed with dismay she seemed to tremble slightly when Lupin came into
the room. Something Lupin also appeared to notice.
He told Harry that Sturgis and Kingsley had already taken Rosenberg away, all the while his eyes
flickering to Tonks who had her back to them, pouring cereal into bowls. Harry hated to see the
uncomfortable way they dealt with each other for the rest of the morning, but he had bigger things
to worry about today.
With no further word on Bill all he could hope was that he was still a way off trying to close in on
her. He left before first classes were due to start, taking his backpack with the scroll still inside, and
after some awkward goodbyes, and a knowingly concerned look from Lupin, Harry reached
Hogwarts, strolling up the grounds in the early morning light, making his way to the Common
Room.
14. Neville's Return of the DA
As Harry passed the Great Hall, the clattering of plates and the chattering of students filtered
though the open doors. He kept his cloak on until he reached the fat lady’s portrait, where he
slipped it off again, giving her quite a start.
‘Ooh!’ she said, sweepingly clutching at her chest ‘I do wish you wouldn’t! I lose ten flakes off my
paint work every time you do that.’
‘Sorry’ he said. She breathed pointedly for a moment, continuing her dramatics, and then she
straightened, obviously feeling her moment was over.
‘That was quite a speech you gave last night.’ she said, eyeing him with snobby appreciation.
‘What happened after I left?’ he asked hesitantly. An amused smile played across her lips.
‘I’ve been hanging here for so long I’ve lost count of the years, and I have seen a thing or two in
that time.’ She looked at him under her brow ‘One thing I’ve learned, is never underestimate the
teenagers ability to ignore the truths of wisdom. What you said is exactly what they needed to hear,
even if they don’t know it yet.’
Harry sighed, ‘Lobalug.’
‘That’s not the password.’
‘What? It was last night when I left.’ Harry frowned.
‘True.’ She had her hands, one over the other in front of her. Harry waited for a moment until it was
clear she was not likely to say anything further.
‘Well?’ he said impatiently.
‘Well what?’ she raised an eyebrow. Harry let out his breath impatiently and turned to head down to
the Great Hall.
‘Where are you going?’ the fat lady said indignantly.
‘To find someone who will give me the new password!’ exasperation laced his voice.
‘Poppycock!’
‘Pardon me?’ Harry turned.
‘The password, its “poppycock”. One of the Slytherin sixth year Prefects chose it.’
- 112 -
‘Poppycock?’ He repeated. The portrait door swung open.
‘Like I said, ignorance in the face of wisdom.’ she added from behind the door.
The common room was practically empty, only Neville and Colin Creevey were sitting at one of the
tables under a window. They looked extremely concerned over whatever it was they were writing,
so much so, they didn’t even notice when Harry crossed the floor and climbed the stairs to his
room. As soon as he had placed the scroll safely at the bottom of his trunk, he shoved the backpack
under his bed and pulled out some fresh clothes to change into. He welcomed the full day of classes
ahead, figuring it would help to take his mind off the coming evening, which loomed over him like a
dark shadow.
When he finally caught up with Ron and Hermione outside Charms class, they both looked tired and
hassled. Harry was grateful they didn’t start in on him for leaving them behind to deal with
aftermath of his speech, but he couldn’t help feeling guilty anyway as he tried to fill them in on his
conversation with Lupin.
It proved awkward however; as Neville, Seamus and Dean kept hovering in the hopes that Harry
might start sharing some of his information with them now as well. But this was not the sort of
information he could share, and it made him feel doubly guilty when they finally gave up, taking the
hint. He decided to not tell any of them about Lupins attack, not even Ron or Hermione. He knew
how Lupin felt about it, and it seemed to Harry that even though it had been a Death Eater that had
been killed, Lupin was far from proud of it, and would wish as few people to know as possible.
Charms class seemed to drag, the normalness of it grating on Harry’s nerves, making him moody
and snappy. After waiting impatiently for weeks for his moment with Bellatrix, Harry was finding
these last few hours unbearable. He wanted Bellatrix stopped and brought in to pay for her crimes,
but the fact that it was Snape who had handed him the means to do it, left a bad taste in his
mouth.
It was an understatement that something about it all didn’t sit well with him, but what choice did he
have? Bellatrix was destructive to the core, she held little or no regard for human life, except
possibly her own, Harry thought viciously. He had to take the only opportunity he'd been given.
Harry went to the Great Hall with the others for lunch, though when he sat down to face the piles of
steaming hot, meticulously prepared food, he had absolutely no appetite. As he sat watching people
load their plates, Hermione started spooning peas and corn onto his, shooting him challenging
looks.
‘Don’t bother. I’m not hungry.’ He said. She looked at him through narrowed eyes.
‘What’s going on Harry?’
‘Nothing.’
‘Come off it,’ Ron interjected ‘we know when something’s up. Spill!’
‘I’m waiting for the Halloween feast tonight.’ Harry said truthfully. Hermione was still regarding him
suspiciously.
‘Oh really?’ she said sarcastically ‘I expect you’ll eat loads then, of course.’
‘That’s right.’ Harry said, getting more than a little irritated.
‘Hey,’ Neville had just arrived at the table. He sat down opposite Harry and handed Hermione a bit
of parchment. ‘This is the lot, so far. They’re all set, they’ll be ready when needed.’ Hermione
skimmed it quickly.
‘I had hope there’d be more than this.’ she frowned.
‘I reckon there will be soon.’ Neville said, smiling at Harry.
‘What is it?’ He asked.
‘A list of people in the DA.’ She said as she handed it to him. There were twelve people on the list.
Harry, Hermione and Ron came first, followed by Neville, Dean and Seamus, then Ginny, Harry’s
stomach tightened at her name, then Luna and Ernie, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott and lastly Colin.
‘No real surprises there,’ Ron said, reading over Harry’s shoulder.
‘I haven’t seen you organizing this.’ Harry said, looking at Hermione questioningly.
- 113 -
‘That’s because I didn’t. Neville did! All I did was enchant some more coins.’
Harry smiled at Neville who was blushing slightly. He had come to school this year with a
determination that even surprised Harry. ‘Actually, I was thinking ... we need to appoint a
coordinator, someone in charge of keeping everyone updated. Make sure we’re all on the ball. What
do you think?’ he asked.
‘I-I thought that’s what you three did?’ Neville said tentatively.
‘Harry’s right,’ Hermione chimed in. ‘we’re swamped, what with the Defence classes and everything.
You’d be perfect for the job!’
‘Well … I-I guess…’
‘Excellent!’ Ron interrupted ‘That’s settled then, lets eat!’
Hermione prodded her finger at Harry’s plate. ‘All of us!’ she said sternly.
Maybe it was Neville’s pleasure at his new assignment, but Harry was suddenly not in the mood to
argue. He picked up his fork and pierced a piece of cauliflower coated in cheese sauce, and lifting it
under Hermiones watchful gaze, he shoved the whole thing into his mouth defiantly. Once he
started chewing, it wasn’t as difficult as he’d expected, and he finished off the cauliflower and
started on some Brussels sprouts, aware that he had a long afternoon ahead of him.
Neville rushed down his food and then jumped up from the table and made a swift exit as Harry put
his own fork down with still half a plate full of beefsteak and mushrooms left. He looked to the staff
table.
McGonagall’s eyes were roaming over the students, and Harry automatically followed her gaze.
Everyone was chatting and tucking into their food as always, and it struck Harry how vulnerable
they all were. Sharing the Gryffindor tower with the whole of the sixth and seventh years, and
conducting the younger students in Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, meant that unlike
previous years, he recognized everyone’s faces as he looked around.
Things had changed so much, that he couldn’t help wondering if Hogwarts would ever be the same
again. His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the entrance of an assortment of brown and grey
owls, flying in through the high windows and circling around the enchanted ceiling. Harry didn’t
bother to look for Hedwig, having pretty much given up on receiving any mail.
A magnificently sized tawny frogmouth owl landed in front of Hermione importantly. Its markings
were striking; it’s grey and brown feathers looked extremely well groomed and it’s blue-black flecks
lining the edge of its face and wings gave it a very regal appearance. Lifting its beak and leg in the
air at the same time in a haughty and obviously well practiced manner, it waited for Hermione to
untie the scroll from it’s leg before launching itself with its impressive wingspan and swooping
silently and elegantly over the tables and back up and out through the windows.
‘Bloody show off.’ Ron said sullenly, clutching Pig in his fist in an effort to stop him from leaving
footprints all over his mashed potato as he danced around enthusiastically on Ron’s plate. He pulled
a message from Mrs. Weasley off the little owls leg, as Hermione opened the ornate blue wax seal
on her scroll, unravelling it. She started reading it and then stood up, flushing brightly, and made to
climb over the bench seat to leave, but Ron grabbed her arm, looking up at her guilty expression.
‘Read it here.’ He said, his face suddenly serious. Harry had guessed the same thing as Ron had,
and took hold of her robes to urge her back down between them. She swung herself back down
slowly and reluctantly opened the scroll once more. ‘What does it say?’
Harry had never heard Ron speak so gravely to Hermione when she was so obviously embarrassed,
he normally took the opportunity to tease her into a further state of red-faced flustering. He could
sense there was trouble brewing.
Harry and Ron both leaned in so no one else would be privy to the contents of the letter as she took
a deep breath, and read out quietly.
‘Dearest Hermione’ she spoke in a squeaky telltale voice that she was very uncomfortable sharing
this with them. After reading ahead a couple of lines to herself, she seemed to decide she could not
go through with reading it aloud, and held the letter away from her so that Harry and Ron could
- 114 -
peer over her arms.
‘I was rather surprised, and yet somewhat delighted, to hear from you. I always suspected there
was a little spark between us. You were frequently attentive to me in our DA classes together. I will
admit, of course, I noticed you too, though I have to say, your abrupt manner was a trifle off-
putting.’
‘Prat!’ Ron said ungraciously, ‘Never figured out it was just him you were abrupt with then?’
‘You obviously tried to catch my eye on more than one occasion last year, but I always rather
thought you had another target for your affections in mind. Still, it is said you should never try to
second guess a woman in love.’
‘Git!’ Ron scoffed, obviously cheesed-off . Hermione was cringing in her chair.
‘Friends of the family are hosting a Champagne and Lobster dinner party next week, there will be a
number of young suitors attending, both male and female, and although I am one of the most sort
after bachelors that frequents these suppers, I have yet to procure myself a partner. I am prepared
to take you as my date, though you must remember we move in high social circles and your
conversation and dress standard would need to suit.’
‘What an insufferable snob.’ The distaste in Hermione's voice unmistakeable.
‘I await your reply; though don’t leave it too long, I am likely to be snapped up soon by some other
lovely young lady otherwise.
Yours most sincerely,
Zacharias Smith’
‘Doesn’t sound like he's exactly head over heels,' Ron muffled a smirk with his hand. 'Maybe you
haven't made the love potion strong enough.’
‘I haven’t used it yet!’ Hermione scowled at him ‘This is just his own delusional take on things.’ Ron
suddenly didn’t seem to find it so funny anymore.
‘What? You mean he likes you anyway … without the potion?’
‘Is that so hard to believe?’ she said a little angrily.
‘Well, no. Its just … we didn’t bargain on that, did we?’ Harry watched Ron, as he gradually turned
pink. ‘I mean, its going to make the potion's effects stronger isn’t it? And what happens when
you’re finished with him? He might not be easy to get rid of. What are you going to do then?’
‘Ron, it’s a potion, when its worn off he’ll go back to normal, normal for him anyway.’ Hermione
said, rolling her eyes.
‘Yeah, but he likes you, and by the sound of things, the only reason he hasn’t approached you
because you treat him like the pretentious boob he is!’ he frowned.
‘It wont be a problem Ron, he’s far too narcissistic to swoon over me for long once the effects wear
off.’ She waved her hand at him impatiently.
‘I don’t know’ Harry said.
‘Not you too?’ she sighed.
‘It could be difficult, now that he’s already shown a genuine interest you. A love potion’s usually
used on people who lack those feelings isn't it. Don’t you think it will heighten the effect?’ Harry
said cautiously, knowing Hermione wasn't in the best of moods now.
‘Maybe, until it wears off, but its only for a short time. Don’t worry!’ she said, looking from one to
the other. Ron did not look as if she had put him at ease at all, and Harry couldn’t blame him. Zach
was extraordinarily arrogant and was rather thick skinned. He wasn’t the sort who was used to
taking no for an answer. Harry wondered if under the circumstances, he would have let Ginny do it
in her place.
- 115 -
It was then that Harry realized he hadn’t seen Ginny. He looked around searchingly. Lunch was
almost over, and the plates would be cleared any minute.
‘Where’s Ginny?’ he asked of no one in particular, his voice louder than before.
‘I saw her up in the common room before I came down.’ Lavender, who was sitting nearby offered ‘I
asked her if she was coming, but she said her and Luna had something to do.’ Harry frowned, for
some inexplicable reason he had the distinct feeling her absence meant she was up to something.
Before he could think about it any longer, the plates vanished and the remaining people in the Hall
straggled out.
Harry headed off to his private session with Sir, while Ron left for the Common Room to study, and
Hermione drifted off to Arithmancy. Harry had learned over the past few weeks that he could expect
anything when he entered the classroom, so he was already preparing himself as he walked down
the corridor.
A strange feeling was growing in him, and he scoffed at his own over-sensitivity, before hearing the
faintest crackling sound behind him. He reacted before he could think, and dropped to the floor,
rolling on his back with his shoulders off the ground, and his wand gripped firmly in both hands,
staring in the direction the hex had come from. The coat of armour behind him clanged and
clattered as the beam of light hit it. Harry was panting as he scrambled to his feet, still unable to
see where the attack had come from.
‘You walked straight past me.’Sir grunted ‘I could have hit you at point blank range.’ Harry was
searching the area in front of him. Slowly Sir came into view, seeming to melt out of the wall, the
disillusionment charm he had been hiding under reversing.
‘How am I supposed to fight something that’s invisible?’ Harry said wearily as he got to his feet and
replaced his wand in his robes.
‘If you can’t figure that out, then you’re not going to last long.’ He said with out looking at him, as
he opened the door to the classroom. Harry followed him in.
‘You’re asking the impossible.’ he said under his breath.
‘The impossible?’ Sir turned on him suddenly ‘What is it you think we have been doing here, Potter?’
Harry could tell this was one of those questions Sir deliberately asked, knowing Harry would not
give him the answer he wanted.
‘You’re teaching me how to duel and-’
‘Wrong! You already know how to duel; you’ve proved it on quite a number of occasions. Do you
think McGonagall would’ve trusted the education of the younger students to you if you couldn’t
teach them how to defend themselves?’ He turned away from Harry again and walked down to the
cleared area in front of his desk.
Harry stayed where he was. Sir had a way of making him feel incredibly stupid and naive at times
like this. ‘What was your instinct as you were walking down that corridor?’ he asked Harry
challengingly.
‘I felt like I was being watched.’ He said reluctantly.
‘And yet you chose not to act on it. Why?’
‘I though I was being paranoid.’ He said quietly, his eyes on the floor space between them. Sir
jutted a finger at him pointedly.
‘Trust your instincts. They are the main reason you are standing here today.’
‘How do I know when I’m right?’ Harry asked, walking towards him slowly.
‘Feel it. I was under a disillusionment charm and that leaves a mark. Magic leaves a mark.’
That night in the cave Dumbledore had been able to sense enchantments, pinpoint them with an
accuracy that had mystified Harry at the time. Now that he thought about it, Harry had also been
quite certain that years ago his invisibility cloak had not fooled Dumbledore when they had stood in
the same room as each other whilst he wore it. Sir was watching Harry when he finally met his
gaze.
‘Can you teach me to sense magic?’ he asked, it seemed almost impossible to Harry.
- 116 -
‘You already can, though you still have a long way to go if it’s going to be of any real use to you.
You have to learn to trust your instincts.’
Harry nodded slightly. Then another thought occurred to him.
‘Can you teach me Occlumency?’
‘Learning how to sense magic is the most useful ways of detecting when someone is trying to enter
your mind. You can block it before they even get close.’ He seemed intensely focused on Harry.
‘But that’s the problem; I can’t block it, I’ve tried.’ Harry said gravely. Sir studied Harry for a
moment.
‘First things first, if you’re going to stay alive long enough to worry about having your thoughts
read, then you need more drilling. I think its time we moved outside.’
They spent the rest of the session hovering on the edges of the Dark Forest, Harry moving through
the trees, waiting for Sir to strike. It was the most arduous session Harry had been put through yet.
A couple of times Harry spent almost twenty minutes by his reckoning, waiting for some sign of Sir’s
attack. It was too easy to drop his guard when he was tiring from a constant state of alertness, and
Abe seemed to know exactly when to strike to get the maximum impact.
On the first lengthy wait, Harry had wielded a spectacular shield charm just in the nick of time,
trusting in his instinct, though he had already cast the shield charm several times previously as a
false alarm. The second time however, he was wearying, and found himself flung against a nearby
tree trunk, unable to react in time to deflect the stun. When Sir had enervated him back to
consciousness, he had felt extremely agitated and a embarrassed that he was still getting caught.
His body ached and he felt stretched, pushed to the point of exhaustion as he headed back up to
the Common Room. When he climbed through the portrait hole, he was met by wary looks from the
other students that littered the area. Harry knew it was primarily because he looked terrible, and he
suspected they still feared he might launch into another rant given any sort of provocation.
Ron and Hermione, were sat with most of the other DA members, only Ginny seemed absent, yet
again. They all looked up at him with varying degrees of worried or dubious expressions.
‘What is he doing to you?’ Hermione asked, a deep frown etched across her face. It appeared she
spoke for all of them as they stared at him.
‘Preparing me.’ Harry said flatly ‘I’m going to get some sleep. Wake me around five will you?’ he
directed at Ron.
‘Maybe you should stay in bed for the night, you look awf-’
‘NO!’ Harry directed far to sharply at Ron, his tiredness getting the better of him. ‘I don’t want to
miss the feast, I mean.’ He added in a more controlled voice.
‘You wont really be missing much,’ Dean said.
‘Yeah, it’s the same thing every year, nothing special.’ Added Seamus. Harry sighed in a clearly
irritated way.
‘If you wont wake me, I’ll stay up.’ He said as he threw himself on the sofa beside Luna. He noticed
instantly that Ron and Hermione were glaring at him questioningly. He knew what they would be
thinking. He had shown so little interest in food lately, that they were finding it hard to swallow that
he was suddenly so desperate to go to the Halloween feast to gorge himself.
‘I’ll wake you.’ Luna volunteered ‘You won’t want to miss the Puffle Crubwoofats!’
‘Er ... the what?’ asked Hannah hesitantly.
‘Puffle Crubwoofats. They only come out on Halloween, and even then only every sixteenth one.’
She said. ‘And tonight is the night.’ She said, her protuberant eyes widening in anticipation.
‘And what, dare I ask, is a Puffed Snub-hoofer?’ Ernie asked.
‘Puffle Crubwoofat’ she corrected him ‘It a pumpkin headed creature that runs up to your front door,
knocks, and then runs away again.’
‘What’s the point in that?’ Ron screwed his face up.
- 117 -
‘When the owner of the house comes out, they appear from behind the bushes in groups of five or
six at a time, then they light their heads up and perform a most interesting re-enactment of the
greatest love story ever to come out of their culture.’
‘Er … why?’ Susan looked completely befuddled.
‘Oh, it’s a long story-’
‘Well, I think I’ll hear about it another time, Luna’ Harry stood up again ‘don’t forget, wake me at
five, okay?’
‘Have a good sleep. Anyway’ Luna turned back to her reluctant audience ‘Legend has it…’
Harry was once again aware that Hermione and Ron’s suspicious gazes were following him as he
headed up the stairs. It was just after three pm, which meant he had almost two hours to catch up
on some sleep. He had no idea what he would be called upon to do this evening, but in his current
state, he wouldn’t stand much of a chance against Bella, so some sleep was essential. He didn’t
bother changing, or getting under the covers. He collapsed onto his bed, pulling the curtains
together to shut out the light, and laid back.
When he finally awoke, he remembered nothing after his head had hit the pillow. Luna came into
focus, standing over him as he put his glasses on. The room was dark, lit only by a low lamp.
'Harry'
‘Thanks Luna, what time is it?’ he asked groggily.
‘Almost six,’ she said vaguely.
‘What?’ Harry suddenly threw his feet on the floor, shaking his head clear. He stood up and opened
his trunk hurriedly, fumbling with the latch in his haste. ‘Why didn’t you wake me earlier?’ he said
angrily.
‘The others seemed to think I should let you sleep. I had to sneak away from them in the end as
they were heading to the Great Hall. I managed to lose them on the stairwell.’
Harry barely heard her as he rummaged through his gear, finally locating the scroll and slamming
the lid down behind him. He took off out the door, Luna calling after him to wait, so he turned and
took a few steps back towards her, grabbed her hand, and pulled her after him, going as briskly as
she would allow.
‘You really are looking forward to the feast, aren’t you?’ she said dreamily.
15. The Seige Of Bellatrix
‘You go in!’ Harry let go of Luna’s hand as he slowed outside the Great Hall. 'I’ll be there in a
minute.’ He picked up his pace again as he veered off to the clock tower, wishing he had bothered
to replace the watch he had drowned in the lake years before. He stopped beneath the enormous
clock face and looked up as the gigantic pendulum swung before him. He backed away so he could
see the hands more accurately.
He still had roughly three minutes. He took off, back inside and brought himself to a controlled walk
before he stepped inside the Hall, positioning himself just inside the doorway.
The room was decorated in true Halloween tradition. Black candles and glowing pumpkins, and
magical bats circling the star filled ceiling. Everyone was already enjoying the Halloween treats that
lined the tables. As he stood there, adrenalin coursing through his body, waiting to hear the deep
resonating chimes of the clock tower once it struck six o’clock, he noticed Ron and Hermione
determinedly walking towards him. He tucked the scroll behind his leg and shifted from foot to foot,
his nerves alive with impatience and foreboding.
‘What are you doing?’ Ron winced as he pulled up in front of Harry ‘You’re sweating … are you ill?’
‘Probably, but that’s not the only problem, is it?’ Hermione looked at him through narrowed eyes.
- 118 -
‘Not now!’ Harry would have to put them off for a couple more minutes. Whatever was about to
happen, he couldn’t bring Snapes name into it. If this was going to be the downfall of Bellatrix
LeStrange, then he instinctively wanted to guard where the information had come from.
Snapes motives had haunted his thoughts over the past few weeks, and nothing Harry pieced
together seemed very likely. He clung to his idea that Snape and Bellatrix were competing to be
Voldemorts top man, but however he had looked at it, he couldn’t figure out why Snape had chosen
to eliminate his competitor using Harry. Unless of course, this was a trap, which had seemed less
likely the more he had tossed it around in his head. Snape had already proved he could reach Harry
easily at Grimmauld Place, so why would he go to such trouble to ensnare him? Too much could go
wrong by waiting so long.
‘We’re beginning to really worry about you, mate.’ Ron said gravely ‘I thought you trusted us? You
used to tell us what you were up to. I can’t figure it out,’ he shook his head ‘what’s changed? We
know something’s going on, we know you’re keeping something from us.’
‘I can’t explain it to you.’ Harry said shortly, listening for the first clang of the bell.
‘That’s not good enough, not anymore.’ Hermione frowned ‘you’ve been expecting something,
haven’t you? And judging by the way you’re behaving, it’s about to happen.’ taking in his fidgeting.
Harry could feel his movements were uncoordinated and nerve driven, as he avoided their questions
and waited for the low echoing toll of the bell.
It should come any second now.
‘I’ll call you if I need you.’
‘Need us for what?’ Ron pried
‘I don’t know yet.’
‘Your not making any sense.’ Hermione continued to watch him.
He was so close to finding out what Snapes warning was all about. Any second he would know what
to do. He looked at his friend’s worried faces; they were about to find out anyway.
‘I have to open this in here,' he said agitatedly, lifting the scroll for them to see 'and I don’t want
anyone else to see it until I know what it is.’
‘What is it?’ Hermione frowned.
‘I don’t know, a warning maybe.’
‘We can see it though, right?’ Ron pushed.
‘I won’t know until I’ve read it!’
‘Harry, this is sounding ridiculously dangerous, where did you get it?’ Trust Hermione to ask the
hard questions. Harry looked around the room, not at all sure what he was looking for. ‘Who gave it
to you?’ she demanded.
DONNNNNG!
Harry straightened suddenly and drew a deep breath. This was it. It was finally time.
He placed the scroll between both hands and placed his fingers under the wax, trying to lift the
blood red seal. It wouldn’t budge. He gripped the edges of the hard wax firmly and squeezed,
snapping the seal instantly. It hissed and fizzled as a small ribbon of smoke rose from the crack.
For a split second, Harry thought it might burst into flames, fearing he had got it wrong somehow.
But the whiff of smoke dissipated and Harry unrolled the parchment with shaky hands. His eyes
scanned down the writing, immediately recognizing it as the same cramped hand that Snapes
potions book had scrawled all through it. Ron and Hermione were watching him, their own
suspenseful agitation growing as he studied the parchment.
He took a sharp intake of breath.
‘What?’ Ron asked ‘What’s it say?’ Harry began to shake his head.
- 119 -
‘I-I don’t believe it…’ he said quietly, baffled as he kept following the writing down the page.
‘Harry! What is it?’ Hermione’s alarmed voice intruded as he tried to take in what he was seeing.
‘I-I don’t understand…’ He swore as his breathing became rapid, his fear rising.
‘What is it?’ Hermione repeated loudly. Ron moved to look at the parchment.
‘It’s a warning, and a spell, but… ’ feeling panic rising in him, Harry continued ‘There are symbols ...
I’ve got no idea what they mean. It looks like each has got a set of instructions to them.’ He swore
again. All thoughts of hiding the contents of the scroll were forgotten in his need. ‘If I don’t figure
out what all of this means in the next four minutes, Bellatrix will succeed at doing something a hell
of a lot worse than what she did at the wedding.’ he said, a sick feeling growing in his stomach as
he held out the parchment.
Hermione grabbed the piece of paper as she and Ron squinted at the tiny wording, reading down
the page. He watched as a look of horror crept across their faces. Ron swore and Hermione’s eyes
watered.
‘Where did you get this?’ she breathed ‘Is it right?’
Harry ran a hand through his already unkempt hair. ‘I don’t know. We can’t afford to ignore it
though, can we? If we do and it is right … then we wont be able to prevent her …’ his mind raced at
the thought.
‘But Harry, who gave this to you?’
‘Don’t ask me that, it doesn’t matter’ Harry snapped, annoyed at her persistence. ‘The point is we
have to act on it.’
‘But this could be a mistake?’
‘Whatever it is, it is not a mistake.’ He said angrily. He felt like too much time was slipping by while
they argued the point. Hermione looked back at the parchment.
‘Hang on mate, calm down. Hermione?’ Ron tried to ease Harry’s growing temper before throwing a
look at Hermione. ‘Can you tell what he’s supposed to do with the symbols?’
‘I should be able to, but I’ll need time. Its some form of runes, but its complicated, they’re worked
in with the spell.’ she said with a frown.
Harry glared at her. ‘We don’t have time. The parchment won’t last. We need to commit it to
memory.’
‘To memory?’ Hermione’s eyes grew wide. ‘Now?’
‘Yes!’ he said impatiently.
‘If we get it wrong, even a little, the spell wont work.’ She said.
‘That’s why we need to stop wasting time!’
‘But-’
‘Harry’s normally right about this sort of thing Hermione.' Ron added quickly. 'He was right about
Malfoy, wasn’t he? He was right about Snape?’
Harry swallowed; Ron had unknowingly touched on the doubts that plagued his mind.
‘What if we each memorize a symbol and its instructions; it shouldn’t be too hard between the three
of us. Lets have a look at it.’ Ron waved her to hold it out for all of them to see. She held it up and
Ron and Harry closed in on it.
‘I should be able to work it out, but we have to get it right. I’ll take the first one Ron, you take the
second, and Harry, you memorize this last one. And remember, some of the symbols can look
almost the same, but their meanings are very different. We have to get it right!’ she spoke quickly
as they studied the page. They were silent for a moment, and Harry registered out of the corner of
his eye Ron mouthing the words as he read over them.
‘How long do we have?’ Ron asked finally.
‘We must be almost out of time.’ Harry said and he started reading over the instructions for the
fourth time.
‘What happens when the time is u-’ But as Ron spoke, the parchment began to bubble as if it were
immersed in acid. Hermione dropped it, gasping as smoke began drifting off the page slowly. They
watched it fizzle on the floor, curling in on itself as it blackened, until eventually there was only a
- 120 -
delicate charcoal skeleton left. Ron crouched down, but it crumbled the moment his fingers touched
it. ‘So, what do we do know?’ he asked as he stood again, rubbing his blackened fingertips together.
‘We have to warn McGonagall.’ Hermione said as she looked to the staff table. All of the teachers
appeared oblivious to the trio at the other end of the room, though as he looked around, Harry
noticed Neville was staring at them from the Gryffindor table. He beckoned him over to where they
were standing, and Neville jumped up with surprising speed.
‘Neville can warn her, or we’ll be stuck here as soon as she finds out what’s going on.’ He explained.
‘You’re right. There’s no way she’d let us out without proof we can help.’ Ron concurred.
‘What’s happening?’ Neville already looked extremely worried as he looked between them.
‘Something’s coming to Hogsmeade Neville … something bad, and I need you to alert McGonagall.’
Harry said, holding Neville’s gaze.
‘Of course,’ Neville nodded as he swallowed.
‘She would try and stop us if she found out what we were up to, so you’re going to have to give us
time to get away. And get the DA ready, but stay here, okay?' Harry said, his hand on Neville’s
chest 'you're backup only, just in case our defence doesn’t work. We've only got one chance at this
Neville. One go, or she'll succeed in destroying the town.’
‘Who?’ Neville asked. Harry watched for Neville’s reaction as he spoke.
‘Bellatrix LeStrange.’ He knew this would have an impact on Neville, and sure enough his face
changed, hardening to a look Harry had never seen on him before.
‘Are you okay?’ he asked slowly.
‘I’ll do it, you can count me in, Harry.’ Neville said.
‘Tell McGonagall Bellatrix has found a way to control Quintapeds, and she’s going to unleash them
on Hogsmeade in less than an hour.’
Neville’s face dropped ‘Quintapeds?’
‘Yes’ Hermione said pointedly.
‘We think we have a way of stopping them. We’re going to head there now.’ Harry said quickly.
‘Give us fifteen minutes before you go to McGonagall. She’ll know what to do.’
‘Alright’ Neville said ‘but how will I know if you need us?’
Harry thought about it for a moment. He hadn’t really seriously considered bringing the DA to the
fight; there would be enough witches and wizards in Hogsmeade that would be forced to make a
stand when it came to it.
‘I’ll send my patronus, a stag. If you see it from the tower, that’s the signal to come.’ Neville looked
a little unsure, but nodded slowly.
‘Remember, give us fifteen minutes, okay?’
He nodded again and Harry, Ron and Hermione left the Hall.
~*~*~*~
‘Quintapeds!’ Ron said darkly as they closed the Hogwarts gates behind them, resetting the locks.
‘Disgusting creatures.’ Hermione said dejectedly.
‘They’re just Voldemorts style, aren’t they?’ Harry remembered vividly what he had read about
them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They came from a small, unplottable island off
the Northern most tip of Scotland, and had a mythical background due to the fact that nobody was
really able to get close enough to study them owing to their liking for human flesh. What was known
about them was that they were rather hairy and had the unusual claim of having five legs.
The trio disapparated, and then re-appeared outside the Three Broomsticks. The golden light that
spilled out onto the street from the pub looked warm and inviting, and as they peered through the
windows they could see that it was a busy night for these times when few would venture out after
hours. The Halloween spirit was captured with large photos of hag-like witches scowling down from
the walls, and ghostly shaped candles dotting the tables.
‘Wish we could go in for a firewhiskey or two before we get started. Now we’re actually allowed.’
- 121 -
Ron said glumly.
‘C’mon, we have to get this set up before they get here.’ Harry led them away from the comforting
chatter into the dully lit and quietly haunting streets.
Harry pulled out his cloak and threw it over them. They huddled together and wrapped their arms
around themselves in the chill as they moved swiftly, not daring to run. Snapes message had
warned Death Eaters might be at large so they had to avoid being seen. Harry found himself
trusting in his gut feeling more and more, reminding himself of what Abe had told him earlier that
day.
Harry had known when he read the parchment that he couldn’t do it alone, and Snape knew his
limitations, as much as he knew Hermione’s talent. The spell would take all three of them. This was
the reason he had insisted Harry be in the Hall when he opened the scroll, it was the best way to
ensure he would be around the help he needed.
The cool night air bit through their meagre clothing. The sky was cloudless and starry, and the
moonlight lit up the surrounding houses and hills in its bluish glow, giving no hint as to the danger
that lurked. They walked some distance past the little teashop Harry had once gone to with Cho, on
their first, and last date. He pulled off the cloak.
‘It said to put the first mark somewhere here, right?’ he asked as he watched Hermione pace the
ground.
‘The position of them doesn’t have to be perfect, what really matters is getting the symbols right.’
She said ‘As long as they make a triangle, it’ll work.’ She took out her wand and pointed it at the
ground. Ron and Harry watched as she drew a white shape on the cobbled pavement resembling a
large W, mirror reflected at the bottom peaks, drawing it out in exactly the order that had been
written below the symbol on the parchment. Next to it she put what looked like an upside Y with a
bar across the bottom and joined the two symbols with three parallel lines, one above, one through
the centre, and one below. She stopped and breathed out loudly.
‘That’s one.’ She said.
‘Let’s go.’ Harry urged. Ron was rubbing his arms against the chill as Harry threw his cloak back
over them. They walked back down the way they had come.
The streets were empty; the only people they passed along the way was a tall weathered looking
man, and a mildly pretty young woman with shoulder length blonde hair.
When they reached the lane that led out to the back of the town, they stopped, emerging from
under the cloak.
‘This will do.’ Hermione said ‘Ron?’
Ron took his wand out and did the same as he had seen Hermione do, this time the symbol was a
square with a diamond laid over the top of it, and something that resembled the letter P, but with
two extra arms attached next to it with what looked like feet. Ron was repeating it in the exact
order he had read, when he suddenly stopped, unsure of where to put the joining lines.
‘Ron!’ Hermione glared at him. He frowned at the ground and then moved his wand to complete the
mark, finishing his part of the spell.
‘I hope that’s right.’ She chided.
‘It is.’ He said guiltily.
‘We’d better get moving.’ Harry said before Hermione could say anything more scathing.
When Harry had completed the last of the symbols on the road that led to the Shrieking Shack, they
headed back to the Three Broomsticks.
‘McGonagall would have called The Order by now.’ he said as they hurried up the street, trying to
keep their feet beneath the cloak.
‘I wonder how many of them will come?’ Ron muttered. It was true that they all seemed so busy
these days that it was unlikely there would be many of them able to be reached.
‘As long as this works, and its not just some elaborate plan to get Harry standing unprotected in the
middle of Hogsmeade, we should be alright.’ Hermione said, glancing at Harry. ‘Rune triangles were
- 122 -
used in the old days. Its said that power can be channelled through the corners and forced to meet
in the centre, colliding and combining at the same time.’
‘If we got it right. It’s going to take one heck of a spell to banish a hundred Quintapeds!’ Harry
added under his breath. Hermione didn’t answer; instead she shuddered, the thought of getting it
wrong seemingly to ghastly to contemplate.
When they reached the outside of the pub, they stopped and eyed the people inside.
‘They’ve got no idea what’s coming, maybe we should warn them.’ Hermione's face creased with
concern.
‘They’re safer inside.’ Harry said and removed the cloak. He motioned his head at the two figures
walking towards them. McGonagall and Slughorn had apparated into the middle of the street, Harry
not at all surprised to see them.
‘Potter! What’s going on? What’s all this talk about Quintapeds attacking Hogsmeade?’ she asked it
angrily, but he could tell she was worried.
‘Surely you can’t be serious? Quintapeds are wild, they wont be working for the-’
‘They are.’ Harry interrupted Slughorn. ‘He’s found a way to control them, and Bellatrix is bringing
them here, tonight.’ McGonagall’s lips thinned.
‘How do you know?’ she asked.
‘I just do.’
Slughorn looked thoroughly unconvinced, fearful even, but McGonagall took Harry aside and spoke
to him in a hushed voice.
‘How do you know?’
‘If I told you, you wouldn’t like it.’ Harry said.
‘Try me.’ She retorted. He tried to read her expression, her mouth was set harshly, but her eyes
held doubt. He took a deep breath.
‘I cant.’ He breathed out resignedly. As much as he wanted to share this particular piece of
information with her, he instinctively knew he shouldn’t.
She sniffed impatiently. ‘I really think if Dumbledore trusted me, you could too.’
‘It’s not a matter of trust.’ He said, ‘If anyone else were to find out, well … next time there wouldn’t
be a warning.’ He almost couldn’t believe he was saying it. Did he really think Snape would tip them
off a second time?
She looked intensely irritated. ‘What is this way of stopping the attack Mr. Longbottom was talking
about?’
‘It’s a spell, a complicated one, but we’ve already set it up.’
‘Set it up?’
‘Yes, Hermione says it follows the old ways, but it’s powerful. We’ve put down a rune triangle.’
She raised her eyebrows. ‘Miss Granger came up with it?’
‘No.’ There was a couple of popping noises nearby.
‘You stay put. Do you understand?’ she poked a finger at him.
‘I’m not going anywhere.’
Lupin and Tonks began sprinting as soon as their feet hit the ground, their cloaks billowing around
them. Harry heard another crack behind them and turned to see Hestia standing underneath the
Three Broomsticks sign.
‘What is it? We came as soon as we got your message.’ Lupin slowed and eyed Harry with a frown.
‘What are you doing here?’
Harry was impressed at the ease with which McGonagall deflected Lupins questions, while informing
the three new arrivals of the Quintapeds impending attack. She explained what was about to
happen expertly as if it had all come from her.
‘I have to get back to Hogwarts, in case the students come under threat. I have confined them to
their dormitories, but I fear they will not all stay there.’ She glanced at Harry out of the corner of
her eye. ‘I’ll leave you to deal with things here, Remus. Professor Slughorn…’ she motioned to him
and he nodded, looking rather relieved to be leaving.
- 123 -
‘Of course.’ Lupin said. They disapparated, leaving Lupin staring at Harry.
‘We don’t have much time.’ Harry said pointedly.
‘What’s this spell McGonagall was talking about?’ Lupin asked.
‘The three of us can do it,’ Harry answered ‘but you have to let the Quintapeds into town.’ Lupin
frowned ‘you’ve got to draw them in so we can banish them. It only works inside the triangle.’
‘Are you sure about this Harry? There are still a lot of people in Hogsmeade.’ Ron and Hermione
were watching him. He could be wrong, but he had to make a choice.
‘I’m sure.’ feeling rather sick as he said it.
‘What’s going on?’ The appearance of so many people outside the pub had attracted some of the
patrons from inside to investigate.
Harry heard a couple more cracks, and saw some more Order members joining them, as Lupin
herded the wizards back inside. It was obvious he had the same thought as Harry; he wanted to
avoid an all out panic. Lupin sent Kingsley into the pub to explain what was happening; knowing
that some people would chose to go home to their families. By the time the Order had navigated a
plan to draw the Quintapeds in, Harry, Ron and Hermione moved to make their final mark on the
ground.
There was a distant sound of wands firing, growing from the main entrance to Hogsmeade, along
with the intermittent cracks of wizards appearing to help in the struggle. Word must be spreading,
Harry thought, watching as Lupin made sure the new arrivals were informed of the plan.
Then a few things happened in quick succession.
A wizard came running up the main street, seemingly surprised at the gathering before him, yelling
and panting desperately that huge hairy monsters had entered the town through the front gate, and
would be in the centre within minutes. Then an Order member that had been sent to keep watch,
apparated before the pub and informed Lupin the creatures were circling the town, and would be
moving in from all sides. The lookout posted at the door of the Three Broomsticks ducked back
inside to pass on the news that the monsters were here, prompting them to pull down the blinds in
what seemed to Harry, a futile effort to avoid detection.
He saw the tall weathered man grab hold of the young blonde woman’s arm in an effort to restrain
her from leaving the building for which Harry was glad, it would be difficult to have even more
people on the streets to defend. She looked extraordinarily angry as the last blind was closed and
they disappeared from view, throwing the street into gloomy foreshadowing.
‘Alright, everyone get into position!’ Lupin yelled at the remaining wizards who hadn’t left to help
defend innocents. They took up positions at the surrounding street entrances, effectively encircling
the trio. Harry, Ron and Hermione stood in the centre of the main road, Hermione directing them
nervously as each drew a long straight line across the ground in front of them, joining the ends to
make the final triangle.
‘That’s it!’ she said, her voice unmistakably shaky. They moved to stand within the triangle and
turned their backs on each other. The surrounding night sky was flashing with shots fired from the
numerous wizards on the outer edges of the town, and the crackling of misfired curses hitting the
surrounding buildings was growing louder.
Then all of a sudden, the noise dropped off and things went deathly quiet.
All Harry could hear was Ron and Hermione’s rapid breathing, as he held his own breath. The quiet
stillness was worse than the fighting. The other wizards tensed, and it seemed to Harry the silence
lasted hours, but it must have only been a few short seconds.
Then people were yelling again, their voices much closer than before, the flashes of light erupting
once more, this time bouncing off the nearby shops and houses. Order members started appearing
in the main street as they backed away from the onslaught, firing hexes pointedly. Harry knew the
creatures were close as Lupin and the others joined in the struggle, wishing he were free to go to
their aid. But he had his job to do. Then he caught his first glimpse of a Quintaped.
Its sturdy, hairy legs, as tall as a man, appeared first. Then its dense, low-slung body came into
- 124 -
view from around the building in front of him. It was a monstrous sight as its wide mouth with
jagged teeth became visible through its thick brown fur. The two wizards standing before it backed
away from the spider-like Quintaped as they fired at it in terror.
‘I hope you know what your doing!’ Lupin yelled urgently over his shoulder, still from some distance
away. Harry’s heartbeat raced. He had to be right about this. If he was wrong, if the spell didn’t do
as Snape said it would… Suddenly Harry was overcome by a wave of nausea. He could hear
Hermiones gasps and Ron swearing behind him, and looking around he could see the creatures were
appearing on all sides. There were stunning flashes shooting through the air before him, but they
seemed to have little effect, the beasts starting briefly, as if they had been struck, then renewing
their slow approach with fevered anger.
‘Lets do it!’ Ron said
‘We have to wait until the last possible moment.’ Harry said determinedly, but his thoughts were not
as sure. This was all wrong. This is exactly what Snape wanted. They would have no hope of
defending the town when the spell failed.
‘Harry!’ Lupin was firing off curses from his wand as he pushed Tonks behind him, backing towards
the trio as the monsters pressed in.
Not yet, Harry thought. He watched as the circle of wizards closed in on them, he could feel
Hermione’s body trembling against his.
‘Harry…’ her voice quivered softly. It's not time, he thought, aware at Hermione’s growing doubt at
his continued silence.
‘They’re getting awfully close, mate!’ Ron sounded angry. Harry watched as the defenders of the
town started touching shoulder to shoulder, the horrific beasts flashing their teeth and eyeing them
greedily.
Almost there.
Harry could see the tears in Tonks eyes as she frantically fired off shots. The Quintapeds were thick
in the streets, pushing in on one another in their effort to get to the reluctant feast.
‘Get ready,’ he said finally, as he raised his wand in front of him. The three of them stood in the
corners of the triangle, back to back, their shoulders touching, and their arms stretched out,
pointing their wands directly above their heads.
‘Harry!’ Lupin was only a couple of feet away from him now. Tonks turned to look at Harry briefly, a
silent plea in her eyes.
‘Do it!’ Ron’s voice urged.
‘NOW!’ Harry yelled forcefully.
Three beams of greyish white light streaked from their wands and soared into the endless sky as
they recited the words that had been spelled out for them. Harry could feel his wand starting to
vibrate as the beams became thicker, brighter, the spell gathering momentum. The Quintapeds
were slowly becoming more aware of the glowing spectacle; many closest to them had stopped
attacking, and were beginning to back up, unable to get far, trapped by the masses pushing in
behind them.
Harry looked up as his wand shuddered. The beams of light coiled around one another, intertwining
and strengthening, becoming one. The air around him became turbulent and suffocating. Cloaks
were flying about the wizard’s bodies, being drawn into what felt like a vacuum, sucking the very air
into the triangle violently. Harry could feel the power coursing through his body; it was unlike
anything he had ever felt before. He was overcome with a desperate need to vent it, and yelled to
his companions to release the spell. His voice carried away with the force of the rushing air but he
could feel they were acting as one. Slowly they brought their arms down rigidly in front of them.
The light flashed and crackled as it separated into three brilliantly white arcs that emanated from
the wand tips, and remained joined above their heads.
Harry’s body jolted as the power flow reversed itself. The ground beneath them shook as the
surrounding buildings vibrated threateningly, the Quintapeds desperately trying to scatter in fear as
- 125 -
Lupin grasped Tonks and shielded her body, the others bracing themselves.
Suddenly, a dome of light exploded over the trio’s heads and expanded rapidly. Harry’s body
relaxed instantly as the power left him. He watched, as it was unleashed on their unwitting targets.
The spell had a devastating effect.
High pitched, ear piercing squeals filled the air as the light passed forcefully, yet harmlessly over
the people, and racked over the Quintapeds. They writhed at its touch, their legs curling underneath
their bulbous bodies before shrivelling as if all of the life had been sucked out of them. Harry looked
away repulsed. He had not expected it to be so vulgar and the guilt swelled in him. Hermione had
her face buried in Ron’s shoulder, his hand resting on the back of her hair protectively. They were
both as appalled at the resulting carnage as he was. The beasts screeched and gurgled as they
collapsed in on themselves, falling like hairy dominos.
As the screams of the monsters faded, Harry became aware of another sound; a bloodcurdling
shriek from a woman’s voice. It was not a yell for help, but a scream of blind fury and frustration.
Bellatrix!
~*~*~*~
Harry gripped his wand with both hands, searching for his target.
Bellatrix was standing before the laneway, black cloaked, mask in hand as she looked around at her
fallen army. A dozen Death Eaters stood in her wake, all surveying the hairy bodies that littered the
streets.
‘You!’ she screeched as she caught sight of Harry and lifted her wand. ‘You’ve interfered for the last
time!’
‘Harry!’ Lupin called out as a red jet of light shot towards Harry, but he was ready for it. He dived
and hit the ground, and as he scrambled to his feet, he saw Ron, dragging Hermione by the hand as
he ran for the cover of a nearby Alley. As another jet of light screamed towards him he took cover
behind the bulk of a dead Quintaped. The noise of the curses hitting solid brick could be heard as
the Order members joined in the fighting, yelling instructions to one another as the Death Eaters
moved in.
The door to the pub before him opened suddenly. A middle-aged wizard brandishing his wand leapt
out onto the street, only to be pushed to ground by Hestia as a green beam of light soared above
them.
‘Julie!’ Harry heard Madame Rosmerta yell from within as the young blonde woman from before, ran
out of the doorway, crouched with her wand in hand, taking cover behind a nearby cart.
He could feel the beads of sweat forming on his brow as he peered out from behind the hairy mass
to see beams of light shooting in every direction. The wizards who had stood together against the
Quintapeds, now scattered as they urgently sought cover. He searched the area before him with
only one target in mind.
Bellatrix was moving through the main street, eyes fixed on the spot where he had taken shelter,
obviously just as determined to seek him out. Knowing he couldn’t stay where he was, he took a
deep breath, and threw himself forward. Scrambling to his feet, he bolted towards the nearest
cover; a small laneway that lay alongside the boarded up Zonko’s.
He felt the curse fired as it careered towards his back, and dived onto the hard cobbled pavement.
The white beam soared over him by only inches and collided with the building before him, sending
bricks and mortar flurrying down over Harry.
He clawed his way to his feet again and in a low crouch, moved quickly through the hairy mounds to
- 126 -
the entrance of the laneway, panting as he reached the safety of a sidewall of the corner house. The
adrenaline was pumping through his veins as he wiped the sweat away from his forehead with the
back of his sleeve. He glanced out into the din and saw Bellatrix bearing down on the cart where the
young woman was taking refuge.
Images of Gabrielle’s horrified face suddenly filled his mind.
‘No!’ Came from under his breath as he darted out from behind the building and fired off a stunning
spell in silence, hoping to catch Bellatrix off guard. But she knew exactly where he was, and had
been waiting for him to strike. She deflected the spell, though appeared surprised at the force of it
as she stumbled backwards a few steps. Harry was about to strike again when the girl suddenly
appeared in his line of fire as she ran towards him.
‘Get down!’ he yelled angrily. The woman dived as Bellatrix fired off another curse. Harry ducked
behind the corner of the house as the beam hit, tearing a gash in the orner of the brickwork. He
stepped back out and aimed his wand, but Bellatrix was nowhere insight; she must have made it to
the cart. He covered the blonde woman as she scrambled to her feet and ran passed Harry into the
cover of the Laneway.
‘You should have stayed in the pub!’ he said aggressively over his shoulder at her.
‘I couldn’t!’ came her angry reply, but before she could say anything else, Harry grabbed her arm
and raced down the darkened Alley.
‘C’mon!’
They hurtled down the Laneway as if the Devil himself were chasing them, weaving in and out of
the hairy lumps in their path. Harry kept glancing over his shoulder, expecting Bellatrix to appear,
shooting a deadly beam at them.
‘You have to find cover.’ He panted, and as they neared the end of the alley. Then Harry felt it. He
thrust Julie in the opposite direction to him at the T-junction, diving behind a stone wall as a green
beam of light flashed passed and contacted violently with a bird bath in a front garden, exploding it
on impact.
‘Run!’ Harry yelled at the girl. She turned, bolting up the street in the opposite direction. He looked
out from his stone cover just in time to see Bellatrix vanish from the laneway. He swore and jumped
to his feet, running for the small street entrance some ways diagonally opposite.
CRACK
He turned, running backwards. Bellatrix appeared in the middle of the road at the end of the T-
junction, behind the wall Harry had been crouched, expecting to have taken him by surprise. He
aimed a stun at her silently, his heartbeat racing. She turned in time to see it and deflected it,
though again it knocked her back a few paces as it rebounded off her shield. She looked infuriated
as Harry lost sight of her behind the houses that lined the street he had entered.
‘Harry!’
He swung round to see Neville coming in the opposite direction up the street.
‘I told you not to come unless I gave the signal!’ Harry said urgently as he raced towards him. He
knew Bellatrix would be right behind him.
‘C’mon!’ he grabbed Neville’s arm and pulled him with him.
‘It’s only me.’ Neville panted as they headed for the road in front. ‘The others … are watching
Hogwarts.’ He panted.
‘This way…’ They had reached another T-junction, and veered off to the left. Harry pulled Neville
with him as he made for the edge of town. He needed cover to face Bellatrix, and the forest that
lined the back of Hogsmeade would give him that.
They tore down the street and Harry kept glancing over his shoulder, sure he would see Bella
appear out of thin air any minute. They reached the end of the road and scanned the dully lit street.
The buildings here were all in darkness, no comforting lights on in the windows and no movements
behind the curtains; they stood deserted, whether from the immediate threat or past troubles. Not
- 127 -
too far off there was a struggle taking place, he could see the flashes of light in the sky above the
houses down the street, he could hear the clashes of curses as they hit the buildings near the trees
in the surrounding forest.
Harry looked to the Alley some way down the road.
‘There!’ he said as he guided Neville, pushing them to run towards it. The roads were now free of
Quintaped carcasses so they ran flat out, pulling to a stop as they came upon the darkened Alley.
Harry studied the shadows that led off into the trees beyond for a moment, and then suddenly a
flash came soaring towards him. He pushed Neville with him as he dived behind the corner house
and watched as the beam of light pelted into the building opposite, scattering debris onto the street.
‘Stay here!’ He threw at Neville, who was crouched in the shadows under a windowsill. If he could
make it to the trees, he would have her! Jumping to his feet, he thrust himself beyond the safety of
the house, lunging into the darkened alley.
He hugged the side of the buildings, trying to conceal himself in the shadows. A green beam of light
shot towards him, sending him scrambling into a nearby doorway to avoid it. The curse smashed
into the wooden door behind him, splintering the wood in all directions and showering Harry with
debris. He waited for a moment then dodged back out, and worked his way along, darting from
doorway to doorway, watching for another attack. Then another flash of light sped towards him,
causing him to take cover behind a stone balustrade lining the stairs in front of him to avoid it.
He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his slightly trembling hand as he sat with his
back against the stone, panting. He had been so determined in his effort to not let Bella get away,
that he had allowed himself to become trapped. He was wondering wildly how he was going to get
out of there while Bellatrix was fixed on him, when he heard a gurgling sound that made his
stomach lurch.
He edged his shoulders up the stonework and turned to peer over the top. His eyes widened and his
heart skipped a beat.
Bellatrix was standing on the path at the end of the road as a large hairy, spider-like Quintaped
came creeping into the street from around the building. He threw his back against the stone again,
swearing under his breath. Of course, there would be some who were outside the triangle!
‘What’s the matter Potter? Afraid of one little Quintaped?’ Bellatrix laughed from a distance. ‘After
killing so many, this one shouldn’t be any trouble for you!’ Harry slowed his panting so that his
breathing made less noise. His only hope was that it would pass him. He could slip out and run for
the trees before it realized he was there.
He could hear the muffled thump of its clubbed feet, and a low rumbling noise gurgling from the
back of its throat as it slowly inched its way towards him. Harry leaned down carefully and glanced
around the edge of the stone, pulling swiftly back in and drawing his breath at the closeness of the
monster. It was headed straight for him. His heartbeat raced as Bella continued to delight in his
impending doom.
‘If your interference means I must die at my Masters hand, then you will die too.’ She said viciously.
Harry’s chest heaved as a hairy leg came into view only a couple of feet from where he was sitting.
His panic rose as a second and then a third leg brought the body of the beast alongside him.
‘You should not have crossed me, Potter!’ She hissed.
Harry sat as still as he could, yet he knew the beast had not needed to see him, it had smelt him.
As he turned his head it barred its teeth at him, its giant yellow eyes glittering dangerously,
hungrily.
‘He wants you for himself, but I will have my revenge!’ she ranted.
Harry started edging back on his hands and feet towards the doorway. He paused fleetingly as he
lifted his wand and fired a stunning spell, but as before, it had little effect The monster only seemed
infuriated by the sting it must have felt from it, and lunged at Harry, just missing his foot as he
scrambled to his feet and backed himself against the doorway, pushing at it furiously. Bellatrix’s
laughter rang out.
- 128 -
‘Say goodbye, Harry Potter.’
The sweat from his body was making his clothing cling to him in the chilly night air as he watched
the creature bring its body towards him. He fired off two more curses that both battered into the
beast, but had little effect except to anger it further. It was no more than four feet away when it’s
jagged teeth bared menacingly and it opened its mouth to lunge at him again.
Instinctively, Harry produced a shield charm as its putrid breath inundated his nostrils, causing the
beast to stumble backwards a few feet as it was repelled. Harry pushed out of the doorway, and
leapt over the balustrade, hurtling himself at full speed towards the trees. As he ran, he registered
vaguely a figure making its way towards Bellatrix along one of the shadowed paths, and as it sank
through his thoughts, he stopped just short of his cover, whispering under his breath.
‘Neville!’
‘And what have we here?’ Bellatrix’s mocking laughter that had followed Harry as he ran, turned
into a wicked simper at the sight of Neville. Popping noises rang out as half a dozen black-cloaked
figures appeared, partially obscuring Bellatrix from Harry’s view.
‘It’s time to go!’ one of them said ‘It’s over Bellatrix! We have to get out of here.’
‘No!’ she bit out, ‘I’m not finished yet.’
‘Don't do it, Bellatrix!’ Harry said loudly, keeping his wand trained on the new arrivals. Neville stood
in the middle of the pathway that lay between the houses and the forest, pointing his wand at her.
The Death Eaters turned at his voice, wands drawn. A beam of light shot out, as a curse was fired
from one of them, but his wand was thrust skyward by another’s angry hand, sending the curse
careering harmlessly into a nearby tree.
‘It’s Potter!’
Harry wiped at his face with his shoulder, impatiently trying to remove the sweat that stung his
eyes. What is wrong with me? His mind felt like it was beginning to fog over as he gripped his wand
in both hands.
‘Neville, get out of here.’ He said in a low warning.
‘She’s going to pay, Harry. She’s going to pay for what she did to my mum and dad.’ He answered.
Harry could see that his wand was shaking slightly as he swallowed nervously. It was obvious
Bellatrix recognized him as she grinned maliciously.
‘Another one who wants to go the same way as his parents! You want to feel their pain, don’t you?’
she taunted Neville cruelly.
‘NO!’ Harry said aggressively as he started to move slowly towards Neville. ‘Its me you want!’
‘Oh, now don't hog all the attention, let the boy have his moment.’ she said as laughter trickled
from her cruel mouth, her wand directed on her challenger. Harry saw the Quintaped out of the
corner of his eye, in the shadows of the buildings behind Neville. It was slowly making its way
towards them.
‘He’s been waiting his whole pathetic life for this,’ she glanced at Harry dangerously ‘and I would
stop moving if I were you. I could just kill him right now.’ Harry stopped with Neville still a good
fifteen feet away. Neville shot out a curse suddenly, but it was flicked aside by her carelessly.
‘Crucio!’
Neville’s shield proved useless. His face contorted and his body curled. And as he screamed in
agony, he dropped to the ground, his wand rolling away from his hand.
‘It’s me you want Bellatrix. Leave him alone.’ Harry felt sick with Neville’s pain, wincing as the
screams inundated his ears. He started firing curse after curse at Bellatrix as she walked towards
Neville’s writhing body, but the Death Eaters stood between Harry and his target, taking all of their
- 129 -
effort to keep up with him, though they did not retaliate at first. They appeared in particular to be
struggling with the force of the stun he was casting at them, stumbling backwards in their attempts
to block it and swearing angrily.
The screaming echoed through the forest behind Harry.
‘STOP IT!’ Harry took off towards Neville again, but the cloaked figures moved forward to block him.
One of them hissed at Bellatrix.
‘We don’t have time for your games.’
She giggled evilly as Neville’s screams became hoarse from the pain. Harry knew what Neville was
feeling; he too had felt it before.
‘STOP IT!’ He roared.
Finally the cries stopped. Bellatrix glanced between her cohorts at Harry with a triumphant grin on
her face as Neville grasped his wand and picked himself up off the ground, groggily stumbling to his
feet.
‘Don’t move!’ Harry yelled to Neville, he could see the Quintaped was lurking in the nearby
shadows. But Neville stretched himself to his full height, and ignoring Harry, aimed his wand at her
once more.
‘No,’ barely escaped Harry’s lips at Neville’s determination.
‘Are they breeding you utterly stupid these days, boy?’ she asked him mockingly. Neville was
staring down his wand at her. She flicked aside a curse he sent her way and it rebounded into the
house beside her, at the end of the street. A loud crack rang out as it sent broken bricks onto the
pathway, but Neville fired again, this time missing Bella as she dodged her shoulder out of its path.
‘You are wasting time! We have to get out of here.’
‘You’re right,’ Bellatrix said darkly in answer to her robed companion. ‘I am wasting time’. Harry
knew what she was going to do before she did it. He knew she was going to revel in Neville's pain.
‘Don’t do it!’ Harry’s furious command had come too late. She had deflected another curse Neville
sent her way with almost no effort, and hit him with the Cruciatus curse again.
Neville hit the ground as before; writhing in agony, and screaming uncontrollably. Harry swayed as
he fought back the bile in his throat, firing uselessly at her again. ‘STOP IT!’
She closed in on Neville and kicked his wand away, and then stepped back again, watching on in
silent pleasure, her mouth curling into a twisted grin. The Quintaped had paused and appeared to
be watching the unusual actions of its intended pray as it writhed in unimaginable pain. Harry
vaguely registered another figure moving swiftly through the shadows of the street, heading
towards them, but Neville’s screams were filling his head, which was already becoming increasingly
woozy, making him feel sick again.
His body was shaking as the chilly night air pierced his damp clothing. He lifted his shaky shoulder
in agitation, wiping the relentless sweat away from his forehead. He couldn’t think straight with the
noise and his mind searched desperately for a way to put and end to this. He opened his mouth
before he could think what he was saying.
‘IF YOU STOP IT, I’LL GO WITH YOU!’
‘What?’ Neville’s screams finally died, as Bellatrix turned on Harry.
‘Leave him alone.’ Harry said more quietly this time. ‘I'll go willingly to Voldemort if you let him go.’
His wand arm trembled as he stared over it at Bellatrix. His eyelids were starting to droop heavily
and his felt the ground swirling beneath him.
‘You expect me to believe you’ll come to your death if I let this useless idiot go?’
‘I give you my word.’
‘No…’ Neville croaked as he staggered to his feet.
One of the Death Eaters spoke up.
- 130 -
‘Lets take him and get out! The others will be here soon.’ he hissed. Harry watched her as she
looked at him through narrowed eyes.
‘Our little boy hero wants to lay down his own-?’ but Bellatrix was cut off by a flash of white light
and was knocked to the ground. Neville threw himself on top of her as another flash of light coming
from the shadows behind the Quintaped, which had started to move in on them again, pelted into
one of the Death Eaters who had their backs to the street.
Harry started firing on them in their confusion, and the hit one immediately with a stun, sending the
masked figure careering backwards with such force that he took two of his companions with him as
he hurtled to the ground. Then from the shadows of the street, two more curses came flying into
the fray. One was deflected, but the other contacted its target, flinging him to the ground.
Harry kept attacking, and so did the person in the street, keeping the remaining four cloaked
figures too busy to interfere with Neville and Bellatrix, who were still struggling on the ground. But,
with three of them now returning his fire, Harry was unable to keep his shield up long enough and
took a hit from two of them at once. The white-hot beams thrust him off his feet and sent him
crashing backwards. There was a sickening crunch in his rib cage as it collided with a tree trunk,
and pain ripped through him as he slumped to the ground.
‘Watch it, you idiot!’
Harry heard the dreamlike echo of one of his assailants muffled voices as he lifted himself slowly off
the ground. Pain forked out across his rib cage, and he shook his head as he staggered to his feet,
trying to clear the fog that threatened to overtake him. He clutched at his side with one arm, and
reached up and wiped the sweat from his eyes with his wand still clutched in his hand. He stared
out on the scene before him, dazed and shaking.
Three of the six Death Eaters were down, and two were firing up the streets in search of who ever
lay hidden. One was watching Harry nervously, taking in his battered condition, but did not move to
attack him.
‘Neville!’ Harry tried to yell it, but it was impossible to get enough air into his lungs. The Quintaped
was creeping up behind the unsuspecting Neville, who was busy struggling to keep Bellatrix from
wriggling like a wildcat underneath him as she clawed for her wand, which lay just out of reach. All
three Death Eaters now faced Harry as he glanced up the street, battling to keep upright. He caught
site of a blonde head poking out of a doorway. Julie!
‘LOOK OUT!’ She yelled in warning, watching the Quintapeds approach on the two struggling figure.
As soon as her voice rang out, the three-cloaked figures span around.
Harry took his opportunity and raised his wand with an unsteady arm firing a stun at one of them. It
pelted into the masked figure, making him groan before falling to the ground. The Quintaped
appeared ready to strike, its controller no longer a threat as she lay beneath Neville, and it eyed its
intended meal greedily. In desperation, Harry sucked in the pain and yelled out to Neville, and
turned all of his curses towards the Quintaped, as Julie fired on the masked menaces.
The curses that hit the Quintapeds hairy hide, only made it flinch, as if bitten by an annoying insect.
Bellatrix had stopped struggling. She had spotted the Quintaped, and was waiting for it to strike
Neville, who had Bellatrix’s wand in hand. He finally turned to see what Harry was yelling about, his
eyes widening as the beasts mouth boar down on him. Neville moved quickly, rolling off Bellatrix
and across the ground, looking back just in time to see the ghastly mouth close over her.
‘NOOOOO!’ her blood-curdling scream rang out as the teeth sunk into her sides and lifted her from
the ground.
The two Death Eaters that were left were backing away uncertainly, firing at the creature. The
monster bit down on its screeching Quarry, and the sound of bone crunching could be heard as its
prey spluttered, then fell silent. Blood ran down the yellowish fangs and dripped onto its fur as it
turned and headed for the trees, Bellatrix’s limp body hanging from its jaws.
With two loud cracking sounds, the Death Eaters were gone.
- 131 -
Some way off, Julie spoke to Neville as she approached him, but Harry could no longer see them
clearly. Their voices seemed to drift into nothing as he hung his head in his hands in an effort to
keep the darkness at bay. Wiping at the sweat in his eyes, he tried to keep focused on the ground
at his feet when a muffled cry made him look up. Neville's still form seemed to glow an eerie green
colour for a second, and then he crumpled to the ground.
Harry joined Julie, automatically firing a stun at the Death Eater who was trying to get up from the
ground. As the curses hit, his head dropped back and his body skidded along the gravel from the
force.
Neville! Suddenly, nothing felt real. Blackness was edging in on his world, but he knew he had to
stay awake. He knew he had to see the motionless figure laying on the path for himself. Then he
would see he wasn't dead.
Clutching at his side, he walked unsteadily up to the blonde girl who was crouched over Neville. Her
shoulders were shaking as she wept into the palms of her hands. The vision of Neville’s body shifted
before Harry’s eyes, doubling and swirling sickeningly. He turned from it, unable to look at it
anymore. He knew where he had to go. He knew someone who could make sense of this, set him
right. He limped off up the street, out of the darkness and into the light.
The buildings lurched ominously and Harry was having trouble keeping his feet, but he stumbled on.
He was finding it increasingly difficult to walk the road, which for some reason appeared to be
becoming lumpy and hairy. He fell a couple of times, and though the pain took his breath away, the
dazed feeling in his head helped to numb the real pain.
As he rounded a bend he couldn’t remember ever having been down before, he saw a sign that no
longer looked familiar. He couldn’t remember where he was going, or why, by the time he
staggered barely conscious towards the darkened doorway.
He eased his body weight against it painfully. The heavy door opened and Harry stumbled forward,
leaning himself against a wall as the door close behind him. He breathed in stabbing pain, dropping
his head back and closing his eyes to the blur. Exhaustion swept over him as his legs began to give
way, his body slowly sliding down the wall behind him.
He vaguely heard the door re-open, followed by urgent footsteps. Harry felt a strong hand grip his
arm and heave him to a standing position.
‘Thought you’d come here.’ A gruff voice said as Harry’s left arm was thrown over someone’s
shoulder. ‘C’mon, lets get you up to a room before anyone sees ya.’
16. Julie
Blurry images faded in and out as Harry struggled with the shadows that engulfed him. Whenever it
seemed he might break free, the pain that tore through his limbs would eclipse the light, pushing
him back into his dark isolation. Sometimes his body burned, and he would feel like he was standing
in the drawing room at Grimmauld Place, opening the locket all over again.
And then there were times when he felt cold, the kind of cold that is born from within the depths of
your very soul. Every now and then, determined voices would seek him out, beckoning him from the
darkness. He would feel himself being lifted, only to splutter and choke on liquids that were being
forced into his mouth. The blackness seemed endless, his struggle, hopeless.
Then finally, he began to break free.
He could feel the shadows gradually lifting and the darkness ebbing away as he slowly came to. He
opened his eyes to the dim orange light that flickered across the canopy above him. His body ached
as he lifted a shaky hand to his head, and ran his fingers through his hair. Even though he was
awake, his mind felt numb, like he was still asleep. He turned his head, spying the bedside cabinet
- 132 -
and groggily lifted himself onto his elbow, reaching for his glasses. They clattered against the wood
as his trembling hand fell on them. Pushing them onto his face, Harry looked out on a room he had
never seen before.
He was lying in a four-poster, canopied bed. The cream floral sheets and quilt were old and worn,
perhaps once they were white, but yellowed with age, yet they were clean. The dark grained
wooden furniture that littered the room showed years of wear by its many scratches, and the
wooden flooring had a large, threadbare rug in the centre upon which an old matching floral arm
chair and lounge stood. They were positioned around the fireplace, whose small flames cast the only
light with which to see by. Someone was lying on the couch; blonde hair was poking out of the end
of a salmon coloured woollen blanket.
Blonde hair.
Harry looked down at the floor thoughtfully. Blonde hair. He felt like that should mean something to
him. His head began to hurt as he tried to make the connection in his mind. He closed his eyes as
the room started to swim. There was a huge emptiness inside of him, physically and mentally. It
was like he was missing something. Something important. The door creaked open.
‘Just closed shop, thought I’d come and have a look at ya.’
‘Sir?’ Harry croaked, confused. He had no idea where he was, but the last person he expected to
see was his Defence teacher. Abe breathed out heavily as he crossed the room. He picked up a
glass decanter that was resting on the mantle piece above the fire.
‘You’d be wanting a drink, I expect.’ Sir's gruff voice was comforting somehow and Harry slowly
raised himself into an upright position, though his vision shifted unnaturally as he did so, causing
everything to drift into two. He closed his eyes again to clear the sickening images from view. ‘Just
take it slow now,’ Sir said as he poured some of the contents of the jug into a cup. ‘Here.’ He said,
and he thrust the cup towards Harry.
Harry took it with a shaky hand and put the full cup to his lips, gulping the contents deeply, trying
to quench the parched feeling in his mouth. As he pulled the cup away, he felt an incredible heat
down the back of his throat, enough to make his eyes sting. He gasped as Sir took the empty cup
and refilled it.
‘That'll put a few hairs on your chest’ he said, ‘and a few other places you wouldn’t want it … if you
drink enough of it.’ He added as he handed Harry the cup again. The warmth was spreading
pleasantly from his throat to his stomach, filling some of the emptiness he felt, so Harry threw the
second cup down the back of his throat, making his eyes water even more.
‘He shouldn’t be drinking that, Aberforth. He’s not well enough.’ The blonde girl had woken and was
sitting upright, glaring disapprovingly at the two of them. Sir rolled his eyes at Harry as he refilled
his cup to the brim again.
‘Wont do him any harm.’ And over his shoulder, he added ‘Firewhiskey’s one of the oldest medicines
around.’ He shook his head at Harry. ‘Healers. There all the same.’ Harry drank the firewhiskey
down, welcoming the sensation of heat.
‘When it comes to some things, yes.’ She stood up and came over to the bed. Harry watched her as
she took the jug from Sir, and grabbing the empty cup from Harry’s hand, she placed them both on
the cabinet. She was a young woman in her early twenties, not unpleasant to look at, with pale skin
and shoulder length blonde hair, a few freckles across her nose and unnaturally deep brown eyes
that had a soulful stare. He thought her features looked familiar somehow, he was almost certain
he’d seen her somewhere before.
‘You don’t remember anything, do you?’ she said quietly, eyeing him with those impossibly deep
eyes.
‘That depends,’ Harry said, beginning to feel the effects of the Firewhiskey.
‘On what?’ Sir asked.
‘On what I’m supposed to have forgotten.’ Harry said with an intoxicated grin.
- 133 -
The warmth of the Firewhiskey was seeping through Harry rapidly, making the cold emptiness
within him retreat. His body didn’t seem to be trembling as severely and his head was no longer
feeling heavy, in fact, it felt rather light.
The woman sighed ‘You’ve never had Firewhiskey before, have you?’
‘Nope.’
‘Honestly Aberforth, you cant just go ploughing him with drink. I bet the strongest thing he’s ever
had is butterbeer.’
‘So what if it is?’ Harry said, getting a little irritated at her inference that he was a kid.
‘I didn’t mean it like that.’ She aimed at him, then turning to Sir, she added ‘He has to remember.
The longer we put it off, the harder it’ll be.’ She seemed way too serious to Harry.
‘C’mon Julie. It’s better like this, something to soften the blow.’
‘What blow?’ An uneasy feeling was creeping over Harry as he watched them drowsily. They both
turned and looked at him. Julie breathed in heavily and sat herself down on the bed. Sir grabbed
the old wooden chair against the wall and pulled it before him, straddling the back of it.
‘Two nights ago, you used a spell’ Aberforth said gravely ‘a dangerous spell … ancient magic that is
rarely seen in this day and age. It saved a lot of people from a horrible death, but it wasn’t without
its side effects.’ Harry’s eyes dropped to the floor searchingly, which was swaying gently. Like Julie,
it seemed familiar, but he couldn’t see it in his mind, he couldn’t remember it.
‘You would have been alright, you would have felt drained like your companions, but you would
have slept it off harmlessly. But you were already ill when you performed the spell,’ Julie said
quietly ‘you just didn’t know it yet. The power that you called upon used a lot of your own energy,
and considering the condition you were in, it took rather a heavy toll on you.’ Harry was frowning at
her, though he could still feel a stupid grin on his lips. ‘We need to help you remember the whole
night, before bits of your memory start accosting you in your effort to piece it together. I can use
legilimency to help put you in touch with the memory you’re suppressing. Connect the dots, so to
speak.’
‘Suppressing?’ Harry slurred slightly.
‘If I can succeed in bringing the whole memory out in one go, then you’ll be able to make sense of
it, and face it. These sort of memories have a way of coming back in mangled pieces until you’re
tortured with an incomplete, and twisted knowledge of what happened.’ Even through the haze of
the Firewhiskey Harry swallowed uncomfortably. ‘Trust me, its far worse leaving it to come slowly,
than bringing it to the surface all at once, quickly.’ She paused and went on nervously. ‘There is the
risk that I wont be able to bring it all out on my first try. It could be too difficult. That being the
case, its always much harder to get in again a second time because …’ she frowned and added
uncertainly ‘because you’ll be, well … you’ll-’
‘Just do it.’ Harry said dully, a sinking feeling had been growing in him along with the muzziness of
intoxication. Something bad had happened, something he had to remember.
‘But, you should know, if I can’t get to the whole mem-’
‘It doesn’t matter. If it’s worse to wait, then it’s better to try, right?’ he said with his eyelids
drooping. He knew there was something missing, and he felt a great need to fill in the emptiness
inside of him. He did not want to put off finding out the truth. He had to know what had brought
him here. He needed to know, and maybe the Firewhiskey had helped him want to face it. She
watched him in silence for a moment, and then she asked him to sit on the side of the bed.
He pulled the sheets back, barely registering he was still in his jeans and a t-shirt, rather than
pyjamas, and swung his feet on the floor, his head swimming in warning as it seemed to trail behind
his movements and his body trembling again. He closed his eyes and hung his head, running a hand
through his hair in an effort to gather himself. Abe and Julie both stood, Abe offering his chair up to
her as he turned it round the right way. She sat down and met Harry’s gaze as he lifted his head.
‘Ready?’
He nodded, and then a thought occurred to him.
‘You wont be able to see anything else in there will you?’ he asked ‘I mean, you’re going straight for
the most recent memory, right?’
- 134 -
‘Don’t worry,’ her mouth curved almost into a smile ‘I wont be fishing around.’ He breathed out and
nodded slightly, rubbing his sweaty palms on his jeans.
Abe stood behind her as Harry met her eyes. She had her wand in hand, and under the determined
gaze of her immensely deep eyes, he felt uncomfortably like she could see right through him,
passed his veneer, and deep into his very heart and soul.
Then it started.
It came slowly at first, starting with the memory of his last lesson with Sir. Moving through the
trees, the dappled light shining through the leaves, then was standing in the Great Hall, talking to
Ron and Hermione. Next, the trio were in Hogsmeade, drawing unusual symbols on the ground.
Harry’s heartbeat was quickening as the images gradually sped up. Each image Julie uncovered was
being swamped with the accompanying memories. The monsters were coming and power surged
through his body, light arcing across the sky as the Quintapeds writhed.
Harry flinched. The sweat was beginning to form on his brow again as the images came more
rapidly. He was running through Hogsmeade, looking for cover, Julie at his side, then she was gone
and Neville was in her place. They took cover and he instructed Neville to stay put.
Harry's breathing was becoming ragged now as the images flashed faster across his mind. He was
running for the trees, but Neville was there. Next Neville was writhing on the ground in agony, and
then Bellatrix was on the ground beneath him as the Quintaped neared.
‘No’ Harry breathed aloud. His stomach lurching painfully as the images bombarded him. This was
all coming too fast. Something awful was about to happen, something he no longer wanted to see.
Neville rolled away and the Quintaped crunched down on Bellatrix … Two cloaked figures vanished …
Julie and Neville greeted each other knowingly. The images swirled. It was coming too fast. He
wasn’t ready for it.
‘NO!’ he said urgently.
But before he could break the link, he saw it. A green flash of light, and Neville dropping helplessly
to the ground.
He panted as he threw Julie out of his mind.
His whole body ached with the weight of it, and he felt like he was going to be sick. He looked up at
her tear stained eyes. She had lived it all again through him. He hung his head in his hands, lost in
his grief.
‘It worked then?’ Sir’s gruff voice interrupted.
‘Yes.’ Julie said in a strained voice. There was silence for a moment as Harry stared at the floor,
trying to slow his rapid breathing.
‘I’ll leave you to it.’ Harry heard Sir's heavy footsteps clod across the floor, and then the creak of
the door as it opened and closed again behind him.
‘I’m sorry.’ Julie said miserably. ‘I knew him too, but not like you.’ Harry looked up at her. ‘His
grandmother was a good friend of my mothers…’ she trailed off when she saw the look on Harry’s
face. He stood up, swaying gently, and without speaking, went into the bathroom and closed the
door behind him. He grabbed a towel from the cabinet, stripped, and ran an overly hot shower
before steping into the scolding waterfall.
Harry’s desolate tears mixed with the hot flow of water. He leaned his hands against the tiled wall,
supporting himself under the punishing water as steam filled the room. His body still shook from
fever, and the effort of showering, along with the grief of Neville’s loss, exhausted him. By the time
he emerged from the bathroom, his skin raw from the scolding heat, his legs barely carried him out
of the bathroom and across the room to his bed.
Julie was back on the couch. She lay motionless as if asleep, but he doubted her mind was at peace
- 135 -
enough for that. There was a note on a small piece of parchment next to the bed, instructing him to
drink the contents of the cup beside it, and go back to bed. And though Harry loathed the thoughts
of sleep and dreams, his body wouldn’t do otherwise. He drank the potion down and slid under the
sheets, fingering his scar, until he drifted into a restless sleep.
His dreams were full of hatred and heartbreak, as he relived the one event he would do anything to
forget. He had grieved as he stumbled his way to the Hog’s Head that night, before he had faded
and lost his memory of it. He had felt like someone had reached in and ripped his insides out, and
now … now that grief was slowly changing, gradually being replaced.
The night played over and over in a never-ending nightmare as anger and sadness coursed through
him. He felt frustration because of his weakened state when it happened, knowing he should have
prevented it. He was angry with Neville for coming to town, when he had told him to stay at
Hogwarts. Feelings of regret swelled in him because he hadn’t made Neville leave the minute he’d
run into him, and a terrible fury flooded him at the Death Eater whose name he didn’t yet know,
who was responsible for killing the one person in this world that least deserved to die. The injustice
of it swamped him, as he burned with fury in shadow.
He felt a cool damp cloth being pressed against his forehead, and opened his eyes. Julie was
watching him as she mopped his brow; her eyes kind and sympathetic.
‘It’ll be okay.’ her whispering voice said as she brought her lips down, brushing the skin she had
cleared of dampness. His mind felt numb, as if he were still dreaming. He was searching for an
escape, for something to embrace that would put an end to his pain. Reaching out, he grabbed her
arm as she lifted it away to leave, unwilling to let his only source of comfort go. She eyed him
almost pityingly, which angered him.
She thinks I’m a kid … She feels sorry for me! He could feel the anger wash through him, and driven
by a need even he hadn’t acknowledged, or maybe because he was still under the effects of the
whiskey, he lifted himself to her abruptly and kissed her.
Her lips were unyielding to his determination at first, but then they parted to momentarily caress
him before they faded. He collapsed back on the bed, throwing an arm over his forehead in
frustration, his eyes looking out of the window, looking anywhere but at her. He felt her rise off the
bed and held back the pain and anger that stewed below the surface. He had wanted the touch of
another; he had craved a distraction from the image of Neville shrouded in a deathly green light.
The bed dipped and Harry turned to see Julie slipping between the sheets beside him. She had
taken her jeans and shirt off, and was wearing only her white bra and briefs. He lay watching her,
as she positioned herself on top of him.
Harry reached out to her in his time of need, and placed his hands on her thighs, slowly running
them up to her hips. He found the feel of her soft skin extremely soothing, and as she brought her
mouth down to his, he closed his eyes, pushing his haunting thoughts as deep as possible.
Her lips were warm and tender, and their touch eased him in his moment of grief. A longing he had
been harbouring for what seemed like forever, awoke in him again, yet this time, he was not
overcome with the need to douse the inner flames that erupted in him. They kissed without heavy
emotion, like all the troubles of the world had disintegrated, and Harry revelled in the
uncomplicated comfort.
She pulled away from him and slid her hands behind her back, unclipping her bra and dropping it
thoughtlessly to the floor. Harry pulled his t-shirt over his head and lay back, taking in her
femininity in the orange firelight, which gave her skin a healthy peach glow. She pressed her body
against his, and as their lips met, Harry rolled her onto her back.
He dragged his lips lightly along the line of her neck, and made his way to her throat, the pain
within him fading behind his want. His hand ventured up her inner thigh, and as it lingered, she
arched her back, her breathing becoming more rapid. Harry lost himself in the pleasures he had
been denying himself too long, and because the act was one of need, not love, there were no fears
of repercussions. It was safe.
- 136 -
He kissed his way down her bare skin, and as his lips closed over her breast, a small gasp escaped
her open mouth. His breathing was becoming ragged, her pleasure increasing his own excitement.
He lifted himself to seek out her lips once more. She kissed him with an urgency that he returned,
and as she reached down and undid his jeans, his tongue met hers, his own ache growing with the
soft want that escaped her lips. He pulled away from her reluctantly to throw his jeans off, and then
settled on top of her with his full weight as he kissed her deeply.
Her hands wandered feely over his back, making his skin come alive beneath her touch, and he
started to feel a great need to complete what they had started. His hand found her underwear, and
eased them down her thighs, and dragging his lips away from her neck, he pulled them off around
her feet.
He came down on her intimately, carefully, seeking solace and an end to his aching want, and as
they shared in their final moments together, Harry pushed all of his anguish deep inside, freeing
himself to burden her with his pain, and finally finding the release that would help him face
tomorrow.
~*~*~*~
During the night, Harry and Julie had lain in the dark and talked, both unwilling to sleep. It hadn’t
taken Harry long to realize that he liked Julie a lot. She was kind and generous, and very free
spirited and independent, if not a little haphazard in her approach to life.
She had examined his rib cage, and aside from some residual bruising, it felt like new, though his
fever lingered, and she informed him it would for another day or two, telling him if he expected to
recover fully, he would have to eat properly and get more rest. She said his body was worn out, and
would crash and burn again if he didn’t start doing the right thing. Eventually Harry drifted into
sleep, more at peace with himself now he'd had something to take his mind off Neville.
He woke later on that morning and dressed, leaving Julie still curled asleep under the covers. He
headed down the stairs; his body still sweating, and feeling weak and sore. Julie had said Ron and
Hermione would have slept the effects of the spell off, but the damage it had wreaked on Harry
made him anxious to see for himself if they were okay. He felt responsible for getting them involved
in it in the first place, and his guilt would only be quelled at the sight of them looking normal and
healthy. Neville’s death was the latest in a string of burdens he'd had to shoulder. He felt anymore
would be too much. Anymore, and he would finally sink with the weight of it.
Harry threw the invisibility cloak over himself as he looked around the grimy, empty bar. Sir was
nowhere in sight, so he made his way across the room and unlocked the door, stepping out into the
brightness of the aftermath of an early snowfall. He pulled his thin jacket about him and set off
through the foot deep snow towards Hogwarts, his mind lingering on Julie’s sleeping form.
She had gotten to know Aberforth rather well while dating what she called, “a vile sack of festering
pus”, who had regularly dragged her along to the Hog’s Head, ordering her to sit at the bar and wait
for him while he met with numerous shady characters. She spent the time chatting to the barman,
and one night about a year ago, Aberforth had spotted her natural talents for healing, when a
particularly nasty incident involving her boyfriend, broke out on the street outside. She hadn’t gone
into details, but the event had disturbed her enough to finally leave him after two years of misery.
Harry had barely reached the edge of town before his body began to tremble again, whether from
the fever, or the coldness of the biting breeze on his sweaty clothing. As he trudged through the
gates of Hogsmeade, the road at his feet started to drift gently to and fro before his eyes, making
the empty pangs in his stomach turn to nausea. He hadn’t reached the halfway point, when his
limbs began to ache, the extra effort required to lift his feet through the snow, exhausting him. He
wished now he had slept last night, his thoughts turning back to his conversation with Julie.
Aberforth had prodded her into setting up her own premises in Hogsmeade, called “JAFZ” or “Julies
Ache-Free Zone”, which she also resided above in a small flat. She would never be qualified to work
in St Mungos, unable to further her studies in healing having barely scraped through her owls at
- 137 -
Hogwarts before leaving in her 5th year, but she hated hospitals anyway, so she really didn’t mind.
Sometimes she worked for little or no money, when ill people came to her with empty pockets, but
she made enough to get by, and had even recently employed her friend Pen part time to help with
the bookkeeping.
By the time he reached the huge iron gates of Hogwarts, Harry found it hard to focus on them. They
seemed to loom over him, drifting dangerously. When they were closed behind him again, he
continued on across the grounds, stopping just outside the double oak doors to remove his cloak
and lean against the wall for support to gather his strength. Once the world stopped swirling
sickeningly, he pulled himself off the wall and walked into the entrance hall, heading up the marble
stairs.
As much as he yearned to see Ron and Hermione, he dreaded each and every step he took; the
guilt over what had happened, and the knowledge of what waited for him in the common room,
hung over him like a shadow in the empty hallways.
He could feel the Fat Lady watching him as he made his way slowly towards her, keeping his eyes
fixed on the ground at his feet. The long trip from Hogsmeade, had left him feeling feverish and
worn out, so he wiped the sweat from his brow on the back of a shaky sleeve, before saying the
password without looking at her.
The Fat Lady had grown rather fond of Neville over the past few years, having had frequent
incidents with him over forgotten passwords, and her silence as he stood there, waiting for her to
swing open, confirmed his worst fears. She blamed him, just like everyone else would. The painting
finally opened to reveal the entrance, and as Harry eased himself through it, he heard a muffled
sniff from her canvass.
His stomach dropped painfully.
He swayed as he walked into the common room. The low talk that had wafted through the room as
he entered, died to complete silence. He stood there for a moment, wishing the ground would
swallow him up, but their was no escaping what had happened.
His eyes fell on the only people in the room who were moving as he waited. Harry was swamped in
bushy brown hair as Hermione threw herself at him. He had thought he would want his friends to
rush to embrace him, but now that Hermione had him in a tight squeeze, he found he couldn’t hug
her back. Harry's arms hung loosely at his sides as she pulled away, her eyes swollen and watery.
‘Are you and Ron okay?’ he asked through shaky breaths as he fought to keep focused.
‘We’re fine, which is more than I can say for you.’ Ron was frowning deeply at Harry.
‘What about Lupin … Tonks … the others?’ he asked.
‘They all made it.’ Ron said solemnly.
‘Harry, where have you been? McGonagall told us what happened … she said you were with
someone who was looking after you, but…’ she trailed off shaking her head, taking in his
appearance and wiping at her damp cheeks with her hand.
Aware that all eyes in the room were on them, he said ‘I’ll tell you about it -’ stopping abruptly as
he saw Ginny emerging from the girl’s dormitory. He felt the sweat beading on his face as he
dropped his gaze to the floor.
She walked silently to him and lifted a hand to his forehead. ‘Your ill, you shouldn't have come back
alone.’
‘We should take you to Madame Pomphrey!’ Hermione said quickly.
‘No!’ Harry said abruptly. He didn’t want to spend the night in the hospital ward, and he didn’t like
them fussing over him suddenly. It felt wrong that they should be so easy on him.
‘Upstairs’ Ginny quietly, and firmly took him by the hand, directing him up to the boy’s dorms.
Harry went; glad to be out of the watchful gaze of the other students. When they reached the
Gryffindor seventh year’s dorm, Ginny went over to the window and closed it against the strong
chill. When she turned, Harry was staring at Neville’s bed, transfixed by the loneliness of it.
- 138 -
Neville’s belongings had already been removed. Nothing remained. Except the knowledge that as far
as Harry was concerned, this was Neville’s space. As much as he didn’t want to think about it, he
couldn’t stop himself. Neville was one of the things about Hogwarts that had made it home. Neville
had always had faith in Harry. He had always trusted him. Guilty tears prickled at his eyes.
A soft touch on his arm made him turn. Ginny quietly spilled warm tears down her cheeks as she
looked at him, but now that he thought about his encounter with Julie, he could no longer look her
in the eye. She took a step closer and held him, but it did not comfort him, instead it doubled his
guilt. He knew he would have to tell her, he knew he wouldn’t be at peace until he did. And then it
would change everything. He knew. This would be the thing that would drive her to let go. But he
could not do it yet, not while her grief was so raw.
She pulled away; surprised that he did not return her embrace. A flicker of doubt registered in her
eyes, but she turned from him and pulled his bed sheets back.
‘Hermione’s gone to tell McGonagall you’re back.’ Ron said heavily as he entered the room.
‘Get in to bed.’ Ginny said as she stripped him of his jacket. ‘I’ll bring you up something to eat.’ Ron
cleared his throat as he hovered awkwardly by the cast iron fireplace.
‘What about class?’ Harry asked as he sunk between the sheets.
‘Saturday, mate. No class till Monday.’ Ron frowned in obvious concern.
‘Don’t you remember what day it is?’ Ginny started to wipe his forehead with a hand towel she had
dipped into the water jug, but Harry grabbed her arm.
‘Don’t’ he said without looking at her. ‘I can do it.’ Taking the cloth from her and pressing it to his
forehead, he laid back and put his head on the pillow, closing his eyes. He didn’t want her to touch
him. He didn’t want her pity. He didn't deserve it. He could sense she and Ron were exchanging
glances in the silence that followed, but it wasn’t until she left the room, that Ron spoke.
‘Where’ve you been?’
‘The Hog’s Head.’ Harry said, opening his eyes again to stare at the canopy above him.
‘Why there?’
‘It’s where I ended up,’ he placed the cloth on the bedside table 'after…' Ron didn’t wait for more.
‘So you were with Sir?’ he said sceptically.
‘Yeah, except he’s not just “Sir” anymore.’ He turned his head to look at Ron ‘His names Aberforth.
Aberforth Dumbledore. Professor Dumbledore was his brother.’
Ron screwed his face up. ‘What … him?’
‘I know now why he looked familiar to me the first time I saw him years ago at the pub. I’d already
seen a photo of him. Moody showed it to me at Sirius’s place.’ Harry stared at the ceiling again. ‘He
was a bit younger then, not so hairy as now, but it’s definitely him.’
‘How come he never said?’
‘No idea,’ Harry had wondered the same thing. There was silence for a moment.
‘You alright?’ Ron asked. Harry closed his eyes again. He didn’t want to go over everything that had
happened. He would tell Ron and Hermione soon, just not right now. ‘It’s just … you’re …’ Harry
looked at him as Ron lifted a finger hesitantly to his forehead, pointing at it ‘you’re playing with
your scar.’
Harry hadn’t even noticed that he was running his finger back and forth over it. He pulled his hand
away quickly. ‘It’s fine, it doesn’t hurt.’ He tried to sound normal, but didn't quite manage it. He had
told the truth, his scar wasn't hurting, but it itched with a strange feeling of pins and needles.
Hermione came in a short time later with a tray of porridge and toast, plonking it down on his bed
as he sat up.
‘We should have made you eat more.’ She said gravely, ‘I knew you were falling ill. I should’ve
made you eat.’ He didn’t feel a bit like eating right at that moment, but listening to Hermione made
him feel incredibly guilty, and he knew if he wanted to get well he was going to have eat more, so
he worked his way through the porridge while Ron and Hermione told him what happened to them
in Hogsmeade.
- 139 -
After the Death Eaters attacked, they ran for cover in a nearby alley, and found themselves being
pursued by two of the black-cloaked figures. They ran from street to street, dodging curses,
occasionally flinging one off of their own, but a terrible tiredness was creeping up on them.
Hermione said it was as if they’d drunk a sleeping potion, and then were stupidly trying to run off
the effects.
Eventually they were slouched against a vacant house, battling to keep their feet when the
persistent Death Eaters, who turned out to be Amycus and Avery, (names Harry recognized
immediately) closed in on them. Ron and Hermione tried to claw their way out of their stupor, but
their was no fighting it, and laughing at the state they were in, huddled in a doorway almost passed
out, Amycus and Avery raised their wands.
Ron said a curse that seemed to come from nowhere, knocked Avery off his feet, and when Amycus
turned in search of the caster, he was hit by a red flash and knocked unconscious too. That was the
last thing either of them remember. They woke up in the hospital wing the next day.
‘Must have been Lupin.’ Harry said. He had finished his porridge, and was lying back on the pillow
again. He closed his eyes as his own tiredness began to get the better of him.
‘Get some rest,’ Hermione said. ‘We’ll be back to check on you later.’
Harry only vaguely heard her as the warmth in his stomach from the much needed intake of food
spread pleasantly through him, and slowly lolled him to sleep.
‘Harry…’ a soft echoing voice called to him from afar. He was floating. Or was he drowning? He was
suspended in a sea of inky blackness, drifting with the current. Up ahead of him he could see a
light. He was slowly making his way towards the murky red glow.
‘Harry…’ there it was again. He pulled his body round to look over his shoulder. But there was
nothing but blackness behind him.
‘Harry!’ the voice echoed louder and he knew its sweet sound. He turned from the red glow, and
then someone was shaking him. Opening his eyes, he looked into Ginny’s worried face.
‘I’ve brought you something to eat.’ Her brow creased, as she stared at him. She was sitting on the
side of the bed in the low light of a single lamp.
‘What time is it?’ he asked, lifting himself up.
‘It’s six thirty, everyone’s in the Hall having dinner. How are you feeling?’
‘Tired.’ He said as he took the tray she handed him. He eyed the roast with a sigh. At least the plate
wasn’t piled high.
‘I didn’t put too much on,’ she said uncannily.
‘Thanks’ He cut the meat and placed it in his mouth.
Ginny stayed with him while he ate, keeping her conversation light as she talked mostly about
Hedwig. Harry asked after Socks, wondering why he hadn’t seen much of her around the castle
since his stay in the hospital wing, and Ginny told him she had disappeared almost three weeks ago.
When Harry looked startled she added that Socks had been the same ever since she’d known her,
which was almost a year. Far longer than Harry would have guessed since Ginny had never
mentioned her before.
The normalness of their conversation helped take Harry’s mind off things that would have affected
his appetite, so that when he finally put the tray down at his feet, there were only a few pieces of
carrot and a roast potato left.
‘Harry…’ Ginny sounded unsure of herself, heavy with emotion as he sat back on his pillows, still
finding it difficult to be under her gaze. ‘Neville came to me before he left for Hogsmeade. He said
something that I think you should hear…’
Harry looked Ginny directly in her slightly glazed for the first time since he returned, feeling a dull
ache in his chest.
17. Hagger's Council and Harry's Abandonment
- 140 -
Harry woke late the next morning to an empty room. Easing himself onto his elbow, he pushed the
curtains that shrouded his bed aside and looked through the window. It must have been close to
midday. The clear blue sky seemed glaringly inappropriate to him, so he closed his curtains on it
and retreated to his dank solitude.
His body no longer ached with fever, and for the first time in a long time, his stomach panged in
hunger. Rubbing his fingers forcefully through his hair his thoughts turned to Ginny. She had sat
with him until he had fallen asleep, even though he had made excuses for her to leave, still finding
it uncomfortable to be in her company. Harry knew she had mistaken his attempts to dismiss her as
feelings of guilt over Neville, never suspecting he would have betrayed her. But betrayed her, he
had. Yet she had sat by his side and passed on Neville’s parting words to her in an effort to console
him, and they had seemed to Harry to be hauntingly final, like he had known he would not return...
The moment Harry, Ron and Hermione had left the Great Hall, Neville had gone back to the table
and told the Gryffindor DA what was about to happen, giving the trio time to get away. Seamus and
Dean had then proceeded to seek out their fellow DA Hufflepuffers and Ravenclaws, arranging to
meet in Hagrids empty hut.
They slipped out of the Hall one by one, minus Neville, who finally went to see McGonagall, who of
course reacted swiftly to the news by ordering all students back to there dormitories just as they
expected. In the ensuing confusion, Neville was able to slip away unnoticed, joining the others as
they planned their next move.
Horrified at what could happen with an army of Quintapeds on the loose, it was decided they should
follow Harry’s request and remain at Hogwarts, taking on the job as Home Guard, ready to warn the
castles occupants should the monsters venture to Hogwarts.
They set themselves up around the outside of the school in groups of two, lurking in the shadows of
the castle, waiting. Ginny and Luna were standing, watching the Gates from a recess not far from
the Hogwarts entrance, when Neville approached them. Ginny had said that he had appeared odd to
her, much calmer than usual, especially given their situation.
‘I-If Hogwarts comes under threat, signal with a patronus, and get back inside.’ They both nodded,
and then Neville took Ginny by the arm and pulled her aside. ‘I have something to do, so I-I wont
be here. But make sure you don’t stay out here if those monsters come. You and Luna stick
together, okay?’
‘Where are you going?’ she had asked him, but he had just frowned at her.
‘Harry won’t understand, but you … you can help him to. It’s what I have to do, the same as he has
his destiny.’ Ginny was beginning to see where he was going with this.
‘Neville, I really don’t think you should-’
‘Don’t worry,’ he interrupted her gravely ‘I know what I’m doing. It’ll be okay.’ He had held his hand
up to her, silencing her protest. ‘Just tell H-Harry that. Tell him its what I have to do, and its okay.’
‘Oh, look!’ Ginny turned at Luna’s whispered warning, just in time to see Professor McGonagall and
Slughorn hurrying out of the massive oak doors, and down to the gates. She watched, crouched into
the shadows as they went through, locking it behind them, and when she turned back to Neville, he
had gone.
Harry pushed the conversation he'd had with Ginny from his mind and finally pulled the curtains
back from his bed, and squinting in the brightness that poured into the room, he pulled his clothes
on and headed down the stairs.
He passed two students as he went, neither of who would meet his gaze as it fell on them. Harry
felt stabs of anger in his chest as he continued down the stairwell. When he reached the bottom,
the few people who milled around the common room chatting to one another suddenly seemed to
find the floor very interesting, as they stood shuffling their feet in silence.
- 141 -
Those who had been flicking idly through spell books took a sudden interest in them, burying their
noses deep as if their very lives depended on the knowledge that lay within. Harry ignored their
obvious avoidance of him and crossed the floor, leaving through the portrait hole without looking
back.
As he made his way through the corridors, he passed yet more students who seemed suddenly
fascinated with the drab stone walls or the scuffed floor, and by the time he entered the courtyard,
he was beginning to feel like the invisible boy, when a voice broke into his thoughts.
‘Harry’
He looked over his shoulder to see Luna Lovegood coming towards him from under the giant willow
tree, where her fellow DA members lingered. The anger in him faded instantly as he saw her
abnormally large eyes glistening with barely held tears. He walked over to meet her half way,
stopping awkwardly in front of her.
She and Neville had been good friends, maybe even more than that, and he could sense she needed
something from him. She stepped forward and hugged him, and for some reason, even though he
had loathed any touch until then, he didn’t pull away. In fact, he hugged her back, and even found
some solace in her embrace.
‘Neville would have followed you anywhere,’ she said in her far away voice. Harry tightened his
arms around her briefly as he swallowed back the pain. ‘He was right to believe in you.’ She said,
pulling away as the others came up behind her. ‘We still … believe in you.’
A hand came down on his shoulder and Harry looked up to see Seamus standing beside him with
Dean at his back. He scanned the forlorn faces before him. Ernie and Susan were looking on with
pained smiles, and Hannah and Lavender both had quiet tears running down their faces as Justin
nodded at him reassuringly. The Creevey brothers, though their faces were long and pale, both held
their thumbs up in approval. Having their support in the face of so much grief brought a lump to his
throat. Unable to talk, he nodded his head in thanks, before turning from them and heading to the
lake.
Harry felt like his life was slowly crumbling down around him. Things had gotten so difficult, and
messy, that he was beginning to feel like he’d lost his way. Where once he had known the direction
he must take, full of determination and conviction, now … now he felt like he was wandering blindly
in the dark, the path lost to him forever.
Trudging down the sludgy snow scattered slopes, he registered a puff of smoke rising into the air
out of the corner of his eye. Turning, he realized it was coming from Hagrid’s hut, so he abruptly
changed direction and headed over to it, his heartbeat quickening along with his footsteps at the
thoughts that Hagrid was back. He at least, was okay. As he climbed the stairs, he could hear
muffled voices coming from within. His hand was raised, ready to knock, when he heard something
that made him freeze.
‘I’m really worried about him, Hagrid.’ Hermione’s voice was unmistakable. ‘You should see him.
You’d barely recognize him. He doesn’t eat, he looks ill all of time. He’s pushing himself too hard. If
he’s not careful he wont…’
Harry thrust the door open having heard enough. Hermione was seated in one of the huge wooden,
oversized chairs at the table, with Ron standing behind her, and Hagrid bent over the fire, poking at
it with a long forked metal prong. Three startled faces looked over at him as he glared at them
angrily, infuriated that they were discussing him as if he needed watching. He had taken care of
himself his whole life in one way or another, and the last thing he needed right now was his closest
friends ganging up on him. Doubting him.
‘Harry!’ Hermione’s faced flushed bright pink guiltily. ‘How are you fee-’
‘I don’t appreciate being talked about behind my back.’ Harry said angrily through gritted teeth, his
excitement over seeing Hagrid safe and sound, overtaken by his ire.
‘We weren’t,’ Ron said with surprise ‘we thought you were still sleeping or we would have-’
‘Oh really, you weren’t?’ Harry glared at them. He had felt under a great deal of pressure lately,
even before the added burden of Neville’s death, but he had thought he’d been dealing with it all
- 142 -
rather well. He had thought he was facing up to his responsibilities. They couldn’t possibly
understand what it was like for him.
‘I think it’s time you two wen’ up to lunch,’ Hagrid said looking at Ron and Hermione from under his
brow, then turning Harry, he said ‘and you … you and I have some catchin’ up to do.’
Hermione stood up, eyeing Harry with uncertainty, and he noticed her hand sought out Ron’s,
closing around it so tightly her knuckles whitened.
‘We’ll see you after lunch,’ Ron said. Harry stepped aside, suddenly unwilling to vent his anger on
them further. He had seen the hurt look on Ron's face, and he chided himself for being so tense.
They were his best friends. Rightly or wrongly, they were concerned about him. The door clicked
shut behind them before Hagrid spoke again.
‘Looks like we both have some s’plainin’ to do.’
Harry sat himself stiffly in Hermione’s vacated chair, eyeing Hagrid warily. Hagrid stopped prodding
the burning wood and without looking at Harry, he went to the cupboards and busied himself with
making a pot of tea.
‘I was gonna come up and see yeh later, but its better yer here. Ron tells me you’ve been busy.’
‘You could say that.’ Harry aimed at Hagrid, who still had his back to him. He blames me. He
thought. He blames me for Neville’s death. Hagrid had never turned on Harry in all the time he’d
known him, but now it seemed even he would not forgive Harry for letting Neville die. A sickening
ache panged through him as his anger melted into regret, his body sagging in the chair.
‘I’d do anything to take it back, Hagrid.’ He said quietly. Hagrid stopped spooning tea into the pot as
Harry added under his breath ‘Anything.’ He bit down on his pain as he dropped his gaze to the
floor, which had become a blur. The harsh sound of Hagrid scraping a chair across the wooden floor,
grated in the thick air as he sat down.
‘I knew you’d be blamin yerself. As sure as I knew you would have done everythin you could to save
him. An' all I can say-’
‘I didn’t do everything I could,’ Harry lifted his gaze to meet Hagrid’s pained frown. ‘I was obsessed
with catching Bellatrix … I wasn’t watching out for Neville. I could have stopped him … I could have
ordered him back to Hogwarts, instead I-’
‘Not from what Ginny tells me, you couldn’t.’ Hagrid interrupted him. ‘Neville wouldn’t have come
back here no matter wha you migh have said. He 'ad one thin on his mind when he left here. An’ it
seems to me, he knew he weren’t comin back.’ Hagrids eyes were bloodshot and swollen as he
sniffed back the tears.
‘He should have come back. He defeated Bellatrix. He avenged his mum and dad. He won.’ Harry
said, his voice becoming more strained as he spoke. Hagrid was looking at him in deep concern.
‘Remember wha he said Harry. Remember ‘is partin message. It were fer you. That’s how much he
thought of yeh. Remember tha’!’
Harry swallowed painfully and rubbed his eyes under his glasses.
‘I want it all to stop, Hagrid.’ He said. He hadn’t meant to off-load, but Hagrid was the only one he
knew who wouldn’t be terrified to hear the "Chosen One" saying he wasn’t up to the job. ‘I’m so
tired of it all.’ He straightened his glasses and looked at Hagrid. ‘I don’t think I can do it anymore,
even if I wanted to. I can’t go through it again. I cant watch anyone else I care about die.’
‘I know wha yeh must be feelin, but yeh know there’s nothing for it. Yeh have to go on. There’s no
escapin it.’ Hagrid’s tears that had threatened ever since he sat down now came tumbling down his
chubby, flushed cheeks.
Harry spoke softly, yet gravely as his eyes search the table, looking for the right words ‘I feel like …
like I’m ... dying inside.’ Hagrid sniffed heavily and wiped at his face with his hands.
‘Its only natural, but yer strong Harry,’ he said defiantly, standing again to resume pouring tea into
two cups ‘Dumbledore believed in you, an tha’ should be good enough fer anyone, including you.’
- 143 -
‘Dumbledore believed in Snape,’ Harry said darkly to himself ‘it was his fault I wasn’t in any
condition to help Neville.’
‘Whadya mean?’
Harry looked up. At first he was stunned at what he had just let slip, but then he thought maybe he
had meant Hagrid to hear. He had a need to share his experience with someone, and Hagrid
somehow seemed like the right choice.
‘Whadya mean, it was Snape’s fault, eh?’ Hagrid said irritably, frowning intently, then something
seemed to dawn on him. ‘He ‘ad somethin to do with tha spell, didn't he? It were one of 'is!’ Harry
stared guiltily from under his brow at Hagrid’s angry face hovering above him.
Hagrid took his silence for agreement and scoffed, slamming the two mugs of tea down on the table
so hard that one of them broke, spraying hot brown liquid all over the table, the floor, and them,
shocking Harry out of his gloomy despair. He jumped to his feet as Hagrid bellowed. ‘Wha’ the
bloody ‘ell is goin on? Ron and ‘Ermione said there was somethin strange with yeh! Wha are yer up
to, eh? Wha have yeh gotten yerself in fer?’ Harry had never seen Hagrid this angry before, and he
was regretting his moment of weakness, but there was no going back now.
‘Before I tell you, I need to know,’ Harry said, his heartbeat racing as he watched Hagrid ‘Does
Legilimens work on you?’
‘Wha?’
‘Just tell me! Can other wizards see into your mind?’ Harry knew Hagrid had resistance to magic
because of his Giant lineage, and hoped it meant that it worked on Legilimens as well.
‘Of course they cant! … Sept maybe Dumbledore!’ Hagrid said, waving an arm about angrily. ‘Wha
the bloody ‘ell do yeh need to know tha fer?’ Harry breathed out in relief.
‘Snape … paid me a visit.’ He said hesitantly.
‘Paid yeh a visit?’ Hagrid repeated with an undertone, still incredibly angrily. ‘You’ve seen tha
maggoty wretch?’
‘Yes … twice,’ Harry swallowed. Hagrid opened his mouth but no sound came out, seemingly too
outraged to know what to say. He clamped his lips together, making them disappear in his wiry
beard, his eyes glittering dangerously as he leaned over the table and thrust a finger at Harry.
‘You’re playin a dangerous game mixin with the likes of ‘im!’ Hagrid said threateningly.
‘It wasn’t something I had much of a choice in actually.’ Harry said, starting to lose his temper.
‘He’s no good, I’m telling yeh! He killed Dumbledore, an he’ll probably use the killin curse on you an’
all, once he’s finished with yeh.’
‘It’s a risk I have to take.’ Harry said slowly through gritted teeth.
‘I cant believe you’d be fool enough teh …’ Hagrid seemed to be so mad, he didn’t know what to
say. ‘YOU’LL GET YERSELF KILLED!’
‘HE’S THE ONE WHO WARNED US ABOUT THE ATTACK!’ Harry yelled back.
Hagrid looked stunned as they stood there, glaring at each other for a moment. Then Harry planted
himself in the chair and told Hagrid about Snapes' visits, and how he had given him the scroll.
‘So the spell was ‘is, then?’
‘Yes.’
Hagrid looked down at his enormous hands as he fidgeted with his fingers.
‘Killed all of them critters, it did…’ He said, fresh tears starting to form in his eyes again. Harry
raised his eyebrows.
‘They would have eaten people Hagrid.’
‘Only cos they were put in the middle of a buffet. Never harmed no one out on their little island, did
they? Kept to ‘emselves, didn’t they? It’s not their fault.’ Hagrid brushed a tear from his cheek.
Harry had not revelled in the monstrous Quintapeds deaths, but he wasn’t all that sorry either.
‘I didn’t know the spell was going to be like that.’ He said tentatively. ‘I didn’t know what it would
do,’ Harry’s voice darkened again ‘Snape neglected to tell us that part. Just like he neglected to tell
us we would be sitting ducks for the Death Eaters when they moved in.’
‘Whadya mean?’ Hagrid met Harry’s gaze.
- 144 -
‘The spell had a tranquillising effect on us. It almost got Ron and Hermione killed. If it hadn’t been
for Lupin, they wouldn’t have made it back.’ Harry’s anger boiled at Snapes callousness.
‘Wha about you? ‘Ow come you didn’t fall asleep?’
‘It affected me differently; Julie said it was because I was ill at the time, already coming down with
a fever ... something to do with my body temperature, I don’t know. But the point is Snape put Ron
and Hermione’s lives in danger by not warning us!’
‘Oh, you’ve met Julie then have yer?’ It was an innocent enough question, but Harry’s guilt made
him react evasively. He sat back in the chair without looking at Hagrid.
‘Yes’
‘Nice girl … got a good heart. It was her who fixed yeh up then?’ Hagrid asked raising an eyebrow.
Harry nodded. Hagrid was looking at Harry curiously.
‘Hagrid’ he began ‘you can’t tell anyone about Snape, not Lupin or any other order member; not
even McGonagall, okay?’
‘I don’t like it Harry. I mean, you said yerself tha’ he didn’t care enough to warn wha the spell would
do to yeh.’ Hagrid frowned ‘Now its over, it’d prolly be best to tell ‘em.’
‘No,’ Harry shook his head slightly ‘If we do that, he’ll never be able to warn us again.’
‘An yeh think he will?’ Hagrid asked, his beetle-like eyes widening.
‘I don’t know, but I do know if we expose him, he won’t be in a position to, even if he wanted to.’
They both fell quiet for a moment, before Hagrid went to a cupboard, pulling out something that
Harry could only assume was bread, though the thud it made as it hit the bench top made it sound
more like a boulder, and then grabbing a knife that looked more like a saw, he started to hack
through it.
He offered Harry a sandwich, and though his stomach still grumbled with hunger, he had sworn off
Hagrids stoat sandwiches years before. Hagrid persisted, echoing Hermione’s criticism saying he
had dark rings under his eyes and looked thin, so that eventually Harry realized the only thing that
would placate him was if he agreed to leave straight away, and head to the Great Hall for what was
left of lunch.
‘Where have you been, anyway?’ Harry turned in the doorway as he left, to look at Hagrid.
‘I’ve bin getting back teh me grass roots, yeh might say.’ He said as he pulled what looked like a leg
of cured ham off the ceiling, though Harry doubted it was anything as normal as that.
‘Has it helped?’
‘these things take time. I left GRAWP behind, so I can’t stay long either, just in case. I came back to
talk to McGonagall and Lupin.’
‘Lupin? Is he here?’
‘Aye. ‘Least he was an hour ago, and it looked like he was in no hurry teh leave.’
Harry turned and passed through the door.
'Be careful Harry. Don’t trust 'im. And don’t turn yeh back on 'im either.' Harry didn't need to ask
whom he was referring to.
He hurried back to the castle, bypassing the Great Hall and speeding up the passageways and
stairwells until he reached McGonagall’s office. Shouting the password before he’d even reached the
gargoyle, he continued as it leapt aside. He rode the spiralling stairway up; stopping only when he
was outside the office, where he could hear Lupins raised voice through the closed doors.
~*~*~*~
Harry knocked on the door, unwilling to overhear something that would annoy him for the second
time that day. Opening the door at McGonagall’s command, he was surprised to see not only Lupin,
but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Aberforth, and Julie as well. Lupin had fallen silent the moment Harry
had knocked, and as soon as Mrs. Weasley had seen Harry, she rushed at him, flinging her arms
around him, and fervently patting him down as if looking for injuries, apparently unaware she was
gripping him so tightly he was struggling for breath.
‘Mrs. … Weasley…’ Harry managed to get out as he started to come over faint.
- 145 -
‘Molly, let him breathe.’ Lupin said, obviously aware of Harry’s discomfort. She pulled away from
him, her eyes swollen with tears.
‘This wont do Harry, this wont do at all!’ seemed all she could bring herself to say.
‘Harry, I’m glad you’re here,’ Mr. Weasley made his way over to him and put his hand on Harry’s
back, directing him into the empty chair in front of McGonagall’s desk. Harry sat down reluctantly,
all eyes turned on him. He knew what they were thinking. They were scared for him, certainly, but
there was another, more unnerving reason they wanted to talk to him.
Lupin perched himself on the corner of McGonagall’s desk with his hands dug deep in the stretched
pockets of his shabby fawn cardigan, staring down at him. McGonagall was sat behind the desk,
looking decidedly uncomfortable as she motioned Mrs. Weasley to sit in the vacant chair beside
Harry.
‘We need to ask you a few questions Harry, and I want you to answer them as truthfully as you
can.’ Mr. Weasley said as he positioned himself with one hand resting on the top of McGonagall’s
high-backed chair. Harry was beginning to wish he’d gone to the Great Hall for lunch, instead of
coming up here looking for Lupin. It hadn’t occurred to him that he would have to face them all
together like this. McGonagall refused to meet his enquiring gaze as Lupin spoke.
‘How did you know about the attack on Hogsmeade?’
It was straight and to the point, and Lupin had asked it in a manner that left no doubt in Harry’s
mind he was expecting a good answer, and would settle for nothing less. As Lupin gazed at Harry
from under his brow waiting for a response, Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.
‘It just sort of … came to me,’ he said finally, thinking of Snapes un-welcomed visit at Grimmauld
Place.
‘Came to you?’ Lupin eyed Harry with determination. Harry looked him straight in the eye, with at
least as much conviction as he spoke.
‘Yes.’
‘What, like in a dream?’ Mr. Weasley asked frowning at Harry.
‘Not exactly, more like a nightmare.’ Harry added under his breath.
They were not happy with his answer. Harry could sense the frustration and anger building behind
Lupins apparent cool persona, and he could feel the tension coming from McGonagall and Mr.
Weasley as they watched them.
‘I know you have been given responsibilities that you cannot share with us, however, I’m warning
you Harry,’ Lupin paused and held Harry’s gaze ‘If you continue to shut us out so completely, we
may not be able to help you when you need us the most.’
‘I know’
Harry breathed out and stood up, uncomfortable at seeming so vulnerable in the chair. He began
walking around the office, glancing at the surrounding paintings that snorted and snuffled as they
“slept”.
‘Harry dear, we’re trying to help you.’ Mrs. Weasleys voice quivered as she spoke. Harry did not
look at her, but continued to walk the rim of the room, eyeing the paintings, stopping when he got
to Dumbledores portrait. He looked as peaceful as ever, seemingly oblivious to the worries that
plagued them all. Harry studied the portrait, waiting for what he least needed to hear, and yet
knowing it was coming.
‘You must understand Harry,’ so it was Mr. Weasley, who would say it, Harry thought. ‘All of us are
invested in this war, every last one of us. Don’t you see, without our help, more people are going to
get killed? By not telling us what’s going on, you’re effectively asking us to leave the fate of our
families, our friends, and everyone else for that matter, in the hands of … of a seventeen year old
boy.’ There it was. Disappointment flooded Harry as he hung his head for a brief moment before
lifting it again and turning on his accusers.
‘Voldemort chose me. He started this. I did not appoint myself. And it was Dumbledore who taught
me that I would have to meet his challenge.’ Harry’s voice was cool, emotionless, like there was
nothing left inside to feel. ‘I watched Neville die three nights ago, and Gabrielle, just over three
- 146 -
months ago. I watched Dumbledore murdered a month before that. And I watched Sirius killed
almost a year before that.’ Harry paused. The room was silent except for Mrs. Weasleys sobs, which
she tried desperately to muffle with a handkerchief held to her mouth. ‘Voldemort chose me.’ Harry
repeated. ‘I used to fear the future because I felt like I had no control over it, but things are
different now. Now I choose Voldemort.’
Sir and Julie had said nothing the whole time, only watching from the sidelines, almost like
uninvited guests. But at this, Sir leaned sideways and whispered something in Julies ear. She
nodded faintly, looking at Harry under heavy eyelids.
‘I am partially responsible for Neville’s death. I know that.’ Harry vaguely registered their pained
looks, but he continued on, not wanting their sympathy ‘But he knew what he was doing that night.
He went out there against my wishes to make things right for himself, and his family. And he did.
And I can only hope that I can do the same when the time comes.’
Harry felt his anger rear ‘Voldemort will stand accountable for what he's done ... for what he's
doing. And right now, the best way to defeat him is to keep my word to Dumbledore.’ Harry’s
steadiness was being threatened by a dull ache that had been growing within him. 'Don't you think
I'm not doing everything I can to prevent further deaths? I've lost people I loved too! People who
were trying to help me ... I don't want to lose anyone else...' Unable to continue, Harry battled to
keep himself together as he looked from Lupin to McGonagall, noticing the doubt in their faces.
‘I know this is hard for you to comprehend, but there was no other way I could have dealt with the
attack on Hogsmeade. You were informed about it within minutes of me knowing what was going to
happen. I was not about to put anyone else in danger if I could help it. There was no other way. You
must understand! There was no other way ... ’ in a fit of desperation, Harry swung round to
Dumbledores portrait. ‘Dumbledore, you know better than anyone … say something! Please! Tell
them I didn’t have a choice!’
For a few seconds it appeared everyone waited with bated breath. Harry watched the portrait
intently, relying on the fact that Dumbledore would not abandon him in his hour of need. After what
felt like an eternity of silence, while the sleeping form of Dumbledore did not stir, but snoozed on,
Harry began to feel the attention of the others redirected to him, staring into his back. Perhaps they
felt sorry for him, or maybe even thought him mad. Harry turned from the painting, despondent
and feeling foolish.
‘It appears there is nothing left to say.’ He walked to the door, ignoring Mrs. Weasleys distraught
calls, and rode the stairs back to the passageway where the Gargoyle leapt back into place behind
him. He felt alone, betrayed. Why hadn’t Dumbledore backed him up? Had he been so wrong in
what he did?
He made his way to his dormitory and started filling his backpack with clothes and anything he
might need in the near future. He wrote a note to Ron, leaving the marauders map with him, and
grabbing the chest that contained the last of his parent’s possessions, he headed down the stairwell,
crossed the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. As he yanked his invisibility cloak
free of his rather full pocket, a voice he had not expected to hear made him turn.
‘Leaving then, are you?’ The Fat Lady was looking down her nose at him, her hands grasped in her
lap, and her face stony.
‘That’s right’ Harry turned his back on her, not sure he could bear to hear her satisfaction.
‘I never pegged you for a quitter.’
‘What?’ Harry turned on her, his anger evident in his tone.
‘A quitter!’ she said shortly. ‘Never thought you’d give in so easily.’
‘Yeah, well it looks like that’s just one more thing about me people don’t know.’ Harry was feeling
rather savage.
‘You’re proving them right by running away, you know.’
‘I’m-not-running-away!’
‘Really?’ she raised her eyebrows at him. ‘What would you call it then?’
‘What do you care? I’d have thought you’d be glad to see the back of me.’
‘And why is that?’ She watched him for a moment as he had trouble meeting her gaze. ‘Ah, of
course, guilt… The most soul destroying of all self induced miseries.’ She was watching Harry so
- 147 -
intently, that it unnerved him greatly.
‘You were no more to blame for Neville’s fate, than you are to blame for being the "Chosen One".’
Her voice cracked as she said Neville’s name. Harry closed his eyes briefly then resumed walking.
He passed along the many corridors and stairwells, and as he descended the marble staircase, he
almost collided with someone.
‘Sorry’ Harry said, without looking up.
‘Harry’
He was yanked from his thoughts by a familiar and welcome voice. He looked back to see it was
Julie who he had collided with, and now she was stepping down the stairs towards him.
‘I was just on my way up to find you.’ She looked almost apologetic for imposing on him. ‘Aberforth
said you would leave.’ But Harry welcomed her intrusion.
‘He was right.’ Harry said.
‘I know a place you can stay, for now at least. Aberforth seemed to think it might be the safest
place for you at the moment … if you’re looking for somewhere, that is.’
Harry had no idea where he was headed when he packed his things, though he had a pouch full of
Galleons, thanks to Bills foresight, but he was also aware that he was highly recognizable, so it had
to be somewhere he could lay low.
‘Sure,’ Harry answered ‘Where?’
‘I’ll take you.’ Julie took his hand and led him down the rest of the staircase. Harry’s eyes barely left
the floor as they made their way down, deep in his own thoughts. When they reached the foot of
the stairs, she stopped and embraced Harry in a warm hug. 'They don't understand, Harry. They
mean well...'
‘I know.’ He said quietly as he squeezed her back. He had been feeling at a loose end, and was glad
to have someone who could ground him again. She was in tune to what he needed, and he found he
did not want to pull back from the comfortable feel of her.
Ron and Hermione came strolling into view over Julies shoulder. They had just left the Great Hall,
Hermione carefully carrying a plate full of food. He let go of Julie sharply, aware that Ron's gaze had
instantly fallen on the two of them.
‘I was just bringing you up some lunch.’ Hermione said uncomfortably as she looked between Harry
and Julie. ‘I thought you might be hungry…’ her voice trailed off.
‘Doesn’t look like he has food on his mind.’ Ron said coldly as he eyed the two of them. Julie
stepped back from Harry in an effort to distance herself, picking up on the awkwardness of the
situation.
‘I-I was just leaving,’ was all Harry could manage.
'Leaving?' Ginny was stepping forward from the Great Hall entrance where she had obviously been
watching them. Her eyes flicked from Harry to Julie, and then back to Harry again, taking in his
backpack as she walked towards them. She stopped by Ron’s side and with deadened eyes, she
spoke to Harry. ‘Aren't you going to introduce us?’
‘Er … this … this is Julie. A healer. Er … she’s the one who helped me ... a-a-after Hogsmeade.’ He
swallowed nervously. Ron looked at Julie with a piercing glare as Harry continued, ‘Julie, er … Ron
Weasley,’ Julie smiled warmly at him, and took the few steps towards Ron, reaching out her hand to
shake it, which softened Ron somewhat. ‘And this is Hermione,’ Harry added, motioning to
Hermione as she off-loaded her plate full of food onto Ginny to shake Julies hand. ‘And …,’ Harry did
not meet Ginny’s eyes ‘Ginny, Ginny Weasley.’ Julie turned to Ginny.
‘I’m sorry, I’d shake your hand, but I’m rather … overloaded at the moment.’ Ginny said, her hands
clutching the food plate still, ‘Where are you going?’ she directed at Harry. Harry shrugged, and
Ginny took him by the hand, pulling him away from the others.
‘What you are doing?’ She asked, her tone flat and her eyes dangerously overcast.
‘Well, I-I don’t know where I'm going-’
- 148 -
‘That’s not what I mean,’ She said gravely, her eyes glistening, ‘what's going on, Harry?’
Harry looked everywhere but at Ginny, her pain and suspicion too much for him to face. That
seemed to be all the answer she needed.
Lifting her arm, she threw the plate of food at the wall, narrowly missing a disgruntled looking
portrait of a Victorian gentleman who unceremoniously scrambled for cover. Harry dropped his
parent’s chest, sending it crashing to the floor in an effort to grab Ginny's arm, attempting to stall
her and explain, but she struggled free and scurried up the stairs with bitter tears filling her eyes.
18. Julie's Pen Friend
‘Is she your girlfriend?’ Julie asked apparently to thin air, but Harry was concealed under his cloak,
trudging alongside her as they headed to the Hogwarts Gates, glad she couldn’t see him.
‘She was, once.’ He had wanted to chase Ginny up the stairs, to try to explain himself, to make her
understand, but the warning look he had received from Ron held him back.
They continued down to the gates, and once through, Harry looked about him. ‘Where to?’
‘Outside the Hog’s Head I think. We’ll go from there.’
They disapparated and appeared almost instantly outside Sir’s pub. Harry followed Julie silently, still
stewing over Ginny’s pain. He could only imagine what she must be feeling, and going by her
reaction, he was beginning to understand she might never find it in her heart to forgive him.
A sickening ache swelled in him as he thought of when he had tried to restrain her, how she had
fought to get free of him. It should never have come to this. And to make matters worse, Ron was
going to be almost as bigger hurdle for Harry. He hadn’t said a word after Ginny had flung the plate
passed Harry and then run from him. He had only glared at Harry as if he too, was feeling as
betrayed as Ginny.
Harry stopped as Julie placed a rather ornate looking golden key in the lock of a small purple door,
jiggling it several times in what looked like a well practiced knack. He glanced up at the sign above
the narrow studio. “JAFZ” it said in large purple letters, and underneath in very small writing, there
were several symbols that Harry recognized to be runes, though their meanings were lost on him.
Julie walked in and waited for Harry to enter, before closing, and locking the door behind them.
Harry removed his cloak and realized he was standing in a waiting room of sorts, though it was
nothing like any he’d ever been in before.
The chairs were ordinary enough, but it was the walls that caught his eye. They were not covered
with the usual health warnings and advertisements for medications; instead they contained two full-
length moving murals.
One of which was a small grassy hill, dotted with purple and white heather, where the long grass
and the shrubs rippled gently in an invisible breeze that wafted pleasantly over them, and running
through the middle of the field, a trickling stream with an old stone arched bridge connected the
two banks, completing the scene. In the background was one of the most beautiful sunsets Harry
had ever seen, with its fiery oranges and pinkish-purple glow adding to the surreal appearance of
the picture.
On the adjoining wall the other picture, though quite different from the first, was just as beautiful. A
log cabin, nestled in small mounds of the purest white snow was surrounded by massively tall,
straight pine trees, which were being constantly dusted with large, feather-light snowflakes that
drifted soundlessly down to the ground. The snow on the branches glittered as if someone had
draped tiny white fairy lights through their perfect branches, and a warm orange glow shone from
the cross-pained, cottage windows as a lazy ribbon of smoke drifted from the chimney atop the
snow-laden roof, giving the cabin a homely and inviting feel. Studying the two murals, Harry had
the feeling he could almost walk right into them.
- 149 -
‘I wouldn’t mind losing myself in them some days.’ Julie said, as if reading his thoughts. ‘Come one,
I’ll take you upstairs to my flat. It’s not very big, but it’ll do for the two of us.’ They mounted the
stairs marked “STAFF ONLY” and Harry found himself in a one room apartment that had a small
kitchenette containing minimal cupboards and a sink, a leather lounge which was quite new looking,
though it was scratched around the arms, a canopied double bed that was reminiscent of the ones
at the Hog’s Head, a small fireplace, and bathroom leading off from the lounge.
‘I’ll fix you some lunch.’
‘I don’t have much of an appetite.’ Harry said dully.
Julie eyed him as he flung his backpack in the corner, and leaned on the back of the couch.
‘That girl, Ginny … you love her?’ she asked as she moved to stand in front of him.
‘I … I don’t know.’ He did love her. He knew it now more than ever, but he was not sure he wanted
to talk about this with Julie, or with anyone for that matter. He had managed to keep Ginny
separate, protected, and he would prefer to keep it that way.
‘So does she know? About us, I mean.’ She had moved in so her leg leant against his. Harry met
her eyes, frowning slightly.
‘Us?’ He asked, beginning to feel uncomfortable.
‘I didn’t mean it like that.’ She smiled at him quickly and took a step back. ‘Though from what
happened, I’m guessing she’s figured out there was something between us. Am I right?’ She was
looking for Harry to open up to her about it, but he was not willing to go into it with her.
‘I’d rather not talk about it. It’s not important.’ He said.
‘Sure.’ She shrugged. ‘Make yourself at home,’ she turned and descended the stairs ‘I’ll be back in a
minute.’
Harry went to the bathroom and washed his face and hands, staring at himself in the mirror. He
was still tiring all too easily and figured he ought to take Julie up on her offer of food. When he
emerged, she was standing at the kitchen, pulling lunch things from the cupboards.
‘Maybe I will have something to eat, if that’s okay?’ he said as he came up behind her.
‘Good to see you’ve come to your senses. You need three meals a day if you want to be at your
peak, Harry. Here,’ she picked up a cup filled with the same purple liquid she had given to him after
she had brought back his memory of Neville. ‘Drink this.’
‘I don’t need anymore sleep.’ He said waving it away.
‘It’s not a sleeping potion; it’s … a tonic of sorts. It’ll help you recover your strength.’ She pushed it
at him. ‘Go on!’ He took the cup, hesitating for a split second, and then drank it down as she
watched. ‘You’ll feel better in no time.’ She said as she smiled. She turned back to buttering the
bread when there was a knock at the door.
‘I forgot.’ Julie said as she rolled her eyes. ‘Pen’s coming over tonight to help go through the books.
Would you mind?’ she asked as she handed him the butter knife. He took over throwing some
sandwiches together as Julie greeted her visitor.
‘Harry!’ He looked round as Julie came up the stairs clutching an armful of paperwork. ‘This is Pen,’
she motioned her head to the young woman traipsing up the stairs behind her, also loaded with
what appeared to be entry books ‘an old friend of mine. We used to go to Hogwarts together.’
‘I know who she is,’ Harry said as he turned to look at the new arrival appraisingly ‘Though I don’t
think we’ve ever been introduced.’ As they dumped their night’s work onto the small round kitchen
table, Harry leaned over and offered Pen his hand. She took it hesitantly, and smiled shyly at him.
- 150 -
‘So tell me Miss Clearwater, how is Percy these days?’
Penelope Clearwater had stayed till quite late in the evening, helping Julie with her paperwork, and
though Harry had tried to make small talk during dinner, casually slipping in the odd enquiry after
Percy, Pen had seemed unwilling to discuss him, saying only that he was away on business rather a
lot with his job, and indicating he was somewhat secretive about what it was he was actually doing
for the Ministry. In the end, Harry gave up and left the two of them to their work, retiring early
because there was little else to do while he was cooped up in Julies flat.
~*~*~*~
When Harry woke the next morning, rubbing his scar idly as it panged, his whole body ached as he
swung his legs to the floor. He had had to lay in the same uncomfortable position on the couch all
night, because it was at least a foot and a half too short for him, making it almost impossible for
him to move during his sleep.
Julie had offered to share her bed, but Harry had decided to settle for discomfort and keep his
distance from her. Even though Ginny may never forgive him, he had neither the intention of
repeating his betrayal of her, nor giving her any reason to suspect he that may have. After easing
himself off the couch, Harry pulled on his shirt, took out his message log with the vague hope that
Hermione might have tried to contact him, and as he flicked through the pages, he was surprised to
see that she had seemingly been trying to contact him urgently since yesterday.
Her first message was that she felt sure there was a rational explanation for what they had all seen
in the entrance, and that Harry should return as soon as possible to sort it all out before his absence
assured his guilt. Further down the page, which she must have written first thing this morning, she
had said that Ginny had refused to discuss what happened with either Hermione or Ron, and
according to her room mates, had spent the entire night staring out of the window, ignoring others
pleas for her to get some sleep.
Harry’s stomach twisted painfully at the thoughts of her so alone.
The next message was also urging him to return to the castle to patch things up with Ron as it
appeared he had taken the events almost as hard as Ginny, and every time Hermione had tried to
mention Harry, Ron had scowled her threateningly into silence.
There were several more entries, each shorter than the last, all urging Harry to come back, until the
final message, scrawled hastily and limited to one line said:
‘Meet me at the Hog’s Head at 11am. URGENT!
Harry looked at the clock on the wall in the kitchen. It was already 10.45, so he dashed to the
bathroom, careful not to wake Julie, and ran some water through his hair in an attempt to push his
fringe down over his scar, and then grabbing his things, he headed to Sir’s pub.
He didn’t stop to think to use his invisibility cloak, his mind overrun with worry about Ginny.
Hermione hadn’t mentioned her in the last couple of entries, and every possible horrible scenario
had started to plague his thoughts, all coming to the same thing, wondering desperately if she had
done something rash.
He arrived at the Hog’s Head with five minutes to spare. Sir saw him and nodded to the corner of
the room where Hermione was already seated. She had not seen Harry enter as her nose was
buried in the latest copy of the Daily Prophet, but when Harry reached her, he yanked the paper
from her hands, staring down at her impatiently. Hermione looked up startled.
‘Ginny’ he breathed. ‘Is she …’ guilt swamped him. ‘Is she okay? Is she still at Hogwarts?’
Hermione nodded in understanding ‘She’s still there. Don’t worry. I spoke to her at breakfast.’
- 151 -
Harry breathed out heavily in relief and collapsed into the chair opposite Hermione.
‘You need to come back, Harry. And not just because of Ron and Ginny.’ She was looking at him
earnestly as she picked up the copy of the Daily Prophet and tossed it in front of him.
‘What’s this?’ he said, picking it up to study the article. Hermione had a worried look on her face as
she watched Harry’s eyes skim the front page.
‘They’re out, Harry. All of them!’ Her brow furrowed as she looked for his reaction. ‘A couple
escaped form Azkaban about a month ago, one of them Avery, of course. But now …’ she hesitated
as if it were the last thing in the world she wanted to say ‘they’re all out.’ Harry’s anger showed on
his face as he continued to scan the column. ‘They killed several of the ministry guards … a-and
three aurors.’ Harry looked up at her suddenly. ‘No-one we know’ she said quickly ‘but it looks like
the Ministry has completely lost control.'
‘Malfoy will be out too then?’ Harry said in disgust as he threw the paper across the table.
‘Yes, and no one seems to have a clue where they are.’ The two of them were silent for a moment
before Hermione spoke again.
‘Harry, tell me about Julie.’
Harry took a deep breath and let out a defeatist sigh as he thought of what he should say. Life was
becoming complicated enough with the mistruths he had already had to tell about Snape, and
everything he was feeling over what had happened with Julie was only making it worse. It was time
to tell the truth, and he felt he could trust Hermione implicitly, even if they didn’t always agree.
‘Sir called in Julie to help me when I fell ill after that spell we used on Halloween. He needed
someone who would keep quiet about where I was, but had the healing skills to help me. She
nursed me back to health, feeding me potions, and healing my broken ribs, but because of the
spells effects I lost my memory of that night, so she had to performed legilimency on me so I would
remember what had happened to Neville.’
Harry had been staring at an extremely small, and rather strange little man hidden in the shadows
of the corner of the room as he spoke, but now he met Hermiones tentative gaze. ‘It sounds
strange, but I don’t think I was myself. I don’t know why it happened, but Julie and I … we … She
knew Neville too, quite well through his grandmother, and I don’t know … I can’t explain what it
was, I was so angry … and frustrated, that … for some reason … I couldn’t help it ... I didn't set out
to spend the night with her.’ Harry sighed as he avoided eye contact with Hermione.
He finally looked up at Hermione as her eyes glazed over, ready for her to abandon him too, but
instead she took his hand and squeezed it.
‘Oh Harry, I’m so sorry you had to go through all of that.’ Her eyes brimmed with tears. ‘I’m not
saying what you did was right. But I think I understand.’
‘What I understand is I’ve messed up my friendship with Ron, and I’ve done something horrible to
the one person in this world I never wanted to hurt.’ He said gravely.
‘That’s why you need to come back. You have to make things right before you lose the chance to.’
She suddenly changed her tact. ‘Your bag was already packed when you came down the stairs.’ she
said. ‘Why did you leave?’
Harry told her about what had happened in McGonagall’s office, how they had railroaded him, and
when he needed it most, Dumbledore had abandoned him. Hermione eyed him curiously.
‘Dumbledore would never turn his back on you Harry.’
‘You weren’t there. That’s exactly what he did. He had a chance to back me up, but he left me
hanging.’ Harry’s anger surfaced again at the thoughts of it.
‘He must have done it for a reason. Dumbledore’s always been there for you ... think about it. Why
- 152 -
would he stay silent when he knows you desperately needed to hear from him?’ She looked at Harry
pointedly. ‘He’s ignored you before, and you didn’t know it at the time then either, but he had good
reason to.’
Just then, Aberforth brought a plate of bacon, eggs, tomatoes and toast, and plonked it down in
front of Harry.
‘I didn’t order anything.’ Harry said, looking up at him.
‘Its on the house, eat it before it gets cold.’ As Sir sidled away, Hermione stood up.
‘I have to go. I’m meeting Zach in a few minutes at the Three Broomsticks.’ She looked rather
nervous.
‘Really?’ Harry raised an eyebrow. He’d been so caught up in his own dealings that he hadn’t
enquired after her for some time. ‘How’s it working out?
‘Its fine’ she replied in a high-pitched voice. Harry knew that tone in Hermione.
‘Remember Hermione … if he’s too much, get out! We can always find another way.’
‘Please go back to Hogwarts.’ she said soberly. ‘I’m just not sure you’re … in the best place for you
right now.’
‘I’ll see, maybe in a couple of days. Give everyone a chance to cool off.’
When Harry returned to Julie’s, she had left a tonic on the bench waiting for him, and he drank it
down in the hopes he would feel more like his old self soon. He waited in the empty flat for hours,
and when she finally turned up, they shared a dinner of curried lamb and rice she had brought back
with her, and then they chatted by the fireside.
Before long, Harry was having trouble keeping his eyes open. He went to settle himself on the
couch, but Julie eventually talked him around to sharing her bed, laughingly promising to resist him.
So after downing her tonic, Harry collapsed on top of the sheets, not bothering to undress, and
drifted off into a bottomless sleep.
It was still night when Harry was awoken, though the full moon cast a silvery glow through the
room giving off enough light so that he could clearly see his surrounds. It took a moment for him to
shake off his post sleep stupor before he realized that Julie was lying against him, slowly
unbuttoning his shirt. He reached his hand up and clasped it firmly over hers, stopping her from
going any further.
‘No...’ Harry said with disappointment as he met her gaze. She looked hurt at Harry’s rejection, and
pulled her hand away before sitting up.
‘I thought…’ she paused for a moment. ‘No one would have to know,’ she said quietly ‘I wouldn’t tell
anyone, if that’s what you’re worried about.’
Harry raised himself into a sitting position and put his feet on the floor. ‘What happened ...
shouldn't have, and it cant again.’ He said soberly, staring at the floor.
She remained silent so Harry turned to look at her.
She was staring blankly in front of her, clasping the sheet to her chest. ‘You're right.’
Harry raised himself off the bed and headed for the couch, pulling off one of the blankets as he
went.
‘I'm sorry, I guess I just figured that it wouldn’t hurt.’
‘I understand,’ he said as he lay on the couch and threw the blanket over him. ‘But it would.’ He
knew he had hurt her, and if he hadn't already hopelessly lost himself in Ginny, he might have
- 153 -
taken her up on the offer. But there was too much at stake. He didn't want to hurt Ginny knowingly
again ... no matter how the need in him grew.
Harry woke the next morning to the sounds of Julie opening the door to a client downstairs. He
knew it would be wrong of him to stay any longer, so he went to the bathroom, stripping off his
clothing and throwing it in the corner, and stepped into the shower.
He returned to the lounge with a towel wrapped around his waist, and threw his backpack up onto
the couch, pulling some fresh jeans, a shirt, and a jumper out. After dressing, he filled the pack
with anything he’d left lying around the room, and then grabbing his parent’s dented chest, he
headed downstairs.
‘Harry!’
He swung round to see Julie staring at him. She excused herself from her client who was looking
rather put out as he laid out on an old hospital bed with an eyeball hanging from its socket, and
hurried to head Harry off.
‘Where are you going?’ she asked as if it was the last thing she expected him to do.
‘Back to Hogwarts.’
‘Why? You know you can stay here as long as you want.’ She almost seemed nervous.
‘I know, and thanks … really.’ Harry looked at her worried expression. ‘Is everything okay?’
‘Of course!’ she said quickly. ‘I’m just worried about you. Er … um, wait here for a moment!’ she
rushed off to one of the back rooms, leaving Harry to stare around the waiting room. The impossibly
clear water trickled peacefully over the odd sized pebbles in the meadow picture, and the log cabin
sitting nestled amongst the trees, whose branches bent under the weight of snow, had fresh
footprints leading up to the door, the windows still giving off their warm golden glow.
‘Here’ Julie had returned with a crystal bottle filled with dark purple liquid, almost black in
appearance. ‘Take this. It’s the potion … in concentrated form, so you only need seven drops mixed
with water. M-Make sure you take it everyday un-until its finished.’ As she handed it to him, her
eyebrows creased.
‘Thanks,’ Harry said as he took it from her and shoved it in his backpack.
‘I’m sorry, for the way I behaved before…’ she said uncomfortably. ‘I don’t know what came over
me, it wasn’t right, and … I’m sorry’
‘Forget it.’ Harry said with a reassuring smile.
‘Come back anytime, okay?’ she gave him a light kiss on the lips. ‘I’ll be here if you need me.’
Harry nodded and turned, walking out the door and disapparating to appear in front of the Hogwarts
Gates.
~*~*~*~*~
His return to Hogwarts had been much as he expected. Ron had made himself rather scarce
whenever Harry entered the same room, sitting some distance from him in class, and either retiring
to bed long before was necessary, or not appearing at all until the early hours of the morning when
he could be sure everyone else was asleep.
Harry grew frustrated that his dreams seemed to be filled with Julie since his return to Hogwarts,
and it was not as if they were just having a friendly chat, some were dreams of the sort that were
similar to the ones he’d only ever had about Ginny, and others were almost motherly. He couldn’t
understand it. He had thought he’d left her behind, sure his loyalties lay with Ginny, but it seemed
- 154 -
subconsciously, she was still very much in his thoughts.
There was another thing about sleep that had come to disturb him too. At first he found himself
often waking in the morning, rubbing his finger along his scar as it tingled and panged against his
forehead, but as the weeks passed, he would wake suddenly, sitting bolt upright in bed, clutching at
his scar as it stung painfully.
But this was something he kept to himself. He had no idea why it was suddenly bothering him, but
ultimately, as much as it disturbed him, he knew it wasn’t likely to end until Voldemort was
stopped.
Meal times in the Great Hall were so uncomfortable that Harry had decided to take his food down in
the kitchen, where he was waited on eagerly by Dobby, and offered the occasional pungent morsels
of food that were long past their best by Kreacher. But it was still preferable to sitting through Ron’s
dagger-like stares, and Ginny’s hurtful avoidance of him, and even though Hermione had tried
talking to Ron, it seemed as long as Ginny suffered, he was intent on making Harry suffer too.
Running the Defence Against the Dark Arts classes was proving more tiresome as well since Ron
had stopped turning up to help. It was left to him and Hermione to manage the seventy odd
students between them, though since the trio's rather famous battle at Hogsmeade, which had been
spread all over the front pages of every wizarding paper and magazine within days of the event, a
rather convenient effect had taken place.
The students had built up a familiarity with him over the previous months, making it difficult at
times to keep order, but "The Unstoppable Chosen One" (as the Daily Prophet had described him)
that had returned, rejuvenated their awe.
All except of course, Hunter, the one first year that seemed to think Harry was like a walking
magnet for Voldemort. Three weeks before the Christmas break, Harry had begun teaching the
students patronuses, and most, as expected, were struggling to produce even a wisp of grey
smoke, but two weeks in, many of the older students were able to produce one at will.
Peter Taphet, the curly-haired first year he had met on the train, was one of those students who
was still unable to produce even the wispy grey smoke, and Harry ventured over to him during one
particular lesson because he had a rather worried look on his face.
‘What’s up?’ Harry leaned down to the young boy. He had liked Peter from the first meeting, but
had developed quite a soft spot for him after finding out from Professor McGonagall that not only
had he lost both of his parents just over a year ago in Voldemorts first attempts at recruiting upon
his return, but that he had also watched them being tortured to death as he peered through the
wooden slats of the cupboard they had thrust him into. He'd had the misfortune of being placed
with his only living relatives that could be found - muggles, who just so happened to be virtual
clones of the Dursleys.
‘I-I don’t think II have a happy enough thought, Mr. Potter.’ Peters cheeks flushed as he stumbled
over his words. Harry crouched in front of him and gave him a wry smile.
‘I didn’t have one either when I was first learning how to do a patronus.’ He said kindly. ‘Sometimes
you have to look deep inside yourself to remember what it is that makes you truly happy. And if you
can find that thought, or memory, then its yours forever, and no-one can take that away from you.’
Peter nodded slowly, but still seemed to be unsure. ‘What’s your happy thought, Mr. Potter?’
Harry smiled. ‘It’s not always the same. As you grow, new situations create new happy thoughts.’
Harry stood up and rubbed the boys hair affectionately. ‘Don’t worry, you’ll find one Peter, if not
from your past, then I’m sure you will in your future.’
‘I’ve got a happy thought for him!’ A sarcastic voice intruded. Harry closed his eyes briefly as he
turned to the familiar voice. Hunter had obviously been listening, and was grinning with malicious
glee. ‘You’ll be stuck here at Hogwarts Taphet, since your relatives don’t want you home for
Christmas, so you’ll have almost four weeks free of being in the company of the Dark Lords number
one target. That should cheer anyone up!’
- 155 -
Harry started to move forward, compelled to grab Hunter by the scruff of his neck, and point out at
least one other person Peter should be happy about not being around for four weeks, but he felt
Hermiones hand on his shoulder, gently holding him back.
She brushed passed him and stopped in front of Hunter, crossing her arms in front of her body
determinedly. ‘As you are so keen to be out of here, I feel sure I can oblige you. There is a little job
that needs doing, which I think you would be perfect for. Follow me.’ Hunter eyed her suspiciously,
but didn’t dare refuse, so he turned on the spot and trailed her reluctantly out of the Great Hall.
Once DADA was dismissed, Harry had an hour free before lunch, then he had his session with Sir,
but he was feeling so tired again, still not fully recovered from his illness, that he decided to take
the opportunity to lie down for a while.
Once upstairs he pulled out the bottle of potion Julie had given him and mixed five drops with
water, before downing it in one go. The potion was good, though unfortunately the effects didn’t
seem to hold him all day. He lay back on the bed and closed his eyes.
But as usual, he was finding it hard to shut down his mind, and it wasn’t long before he gave up and
headed back down to the common room, feeling much more invigorated now the potion had had a
chance to work through him. When he emerged at the bottom of the stairs, he looked around for
someone to talk to, feeling full of energy.
At first, the room appeared empty, then spying the back of Hermione’s bushy brown hair, he made
a beeline for her, only to slow when he realized she was in the middle of an argument with Ron.
They both had their backs to him, so he decided not to reveal himself.
He had been shut out of their dealings with Zach because Ron still had not forgiven him, but Harry
was getting increasingly worried about Hermione lately. She had seemed distracted much of the
time, and Harry had sensed things were not going as smoothly as she had hoped. He stood silently,
listening.
‘He only wants to show it to me because I asked him about places that were important to his family,
Ron! You need to get a grip! He’s too young to be thinking about marriage! Anyway, there’s other
ways for me to get what I need without resorting to that!’ Hermione sounded much more stressed
than she would have liked to let on.
‘What’s that supposed to mean, other ways?’ Ron asked suspiciously.
‘Oh, don't be such a fool!’ Harry could tell Hermione’s temper was hanging by a thread. ‘I’m talking
about other methods that don’t include a love potion.’
‘Hermione, you’ve been working on this for weeks, and you’ve been ploughing him cherry “love”
liqueurs all this time. Don’t you think the fact that he’s brought up the family wedding chapel is a
humungous hint? I mean, who talks about stuff like that when you’ve only being seeing each other
for such a short time ... he’s becoming obsessed!’ Even though Harry could not see Ron’s face, his
ears were visibly red, giving away how much it bothered him.
‘Something tells me this is it, Ron. We’re getting close on this one.’
‘We’re not the only ones getting close on this one!’ Ron said darkly. ‘Don’t think I didn’t notice the
condition you were in when came back from your date last weekend!’
‘What are you insinuating, Ronald Weasley?’ she asked, and Harry knew trouble was coming.
‘You’re in over your head, and I’m telling you now,’ Ron leaned over and point a finger at her ‘If he
oversteps the mark, love potion or not, I’ll hex him so badly, they’ll never get him to look the same
again.’
‘He hasn’t over-stepped the mark,’ Hermione said, and to Harry she sounded rather unconvincing.
She sighed heavily. ‘I just wish we could sit down with Harry and discuss this. He’s the one who
knows Riddle, he’d have a better idea than anyone whether it might be a good place to look.’
- 156 -
‘Then talk to me,’ Harry said as he walked forward. ‘You’re right, I do know more about Tom Riddle
than anyone else here.’ Harry looked at Ron who was all of a sudden concentrating on re-tying his
perfectly secure shoelace. Harry’s temper got the better of him as he watched Ron. ‘Your pettiness
is not only putting Hermione at risk, Ron, but everyone else as well.’
Hermione looked taken-a-back at Harry’s lack of tact, and Ron looked like he was on the verge of
taking a swing at him. Harry ignored their glares.
‘You can't shut me out of this. It’s me who has to destroy the cup. We have to work together. You
don’t give Ginny enough credit to face her own problems.’
Ron jumped up suddenly, but Hermione moved just as swiftly, placing herself between them.
‘As much as I hate to admit it,’ She gave Harry a look that said in no uncertain terms she did hate
to side with him after his callousness. ‘Harry’s right. We need to do this together if we’re going to
have a hope of figuring it out.’
‘Why don’t you fill him in then if you’re such pals?’ And Ron turned to leave.
‘We are dealing with something bigger than your loyalty to Ginny’s hurt feelings.’ Harry said coldly.
‘In fact, its bigger than all of us! If you cant find a way to put it behind you, at least for now, then
you’re going to end up hurting Ginny, and everyone else you care about far more than I ever could.’
Ron didn’t seem to have a response to that, so Harry sat down on the couch and looked between
them. ‘Tell me what you’ve found out.’
Hermione explained how she had accompanied Zach on several dates, always bringing him a box of
his favourite liqueurs laced with love potion to seal his fate. Each had a day of the week imprinted
on it as a "romantic" gesture of Hermione wishes that he take just one each morning to remind him
of her. Hermione said he was so arrogant he hadn't questioned her wishes, and revelled in eating
one every morning with the knowledge that she would be swooning over him.
Ron chimed in at this point, his anger at Harry obviously overpowered by his jealousy at Zach’s
attentions on Hermione, and had sarcastically pointed out that Zach had been sending her
messages everyday, and more often than not, up to three times a day, proclaiming his adoration for
her. Ron had then slipped in a comment at what she must have done to get such a reaction from
him, and Harry, who had been ready for something like this, had to react quickly, grabbing
Hermione’s half raised hand that had been heading for Rons face, easing it down again in an
attempt to stop their frustration escalating any further.
Apparently, not long ago, Zach arranged for her to meet his family. Not just a small gathering with
his parents either, but his entire extended family.
Hermione said that when she had arrived, they had all greeted her warmly, and it wasn’t long
before the women, who had been huddled in a corner discussing her excitedly, pulled her aside and
started talking wedding arrangements (this part she had wisely tried to keep from Ron, but she now
found it impossible since they were all together).
Ron’s face was dark and broody as it was revealed that the original Hufflepuff family had used the
same church for marriage ceremonies for centuries, and although the original church had been
destroyed long ago, a new one had been erected on the same site, and the tradition had been
handed down to this day.
During her visits to Zach’s, Hermione had already checked out the house and grounds the Smith
family lived in, and it wasn’t nearly old enough as it should be to hold any sort of special place for
one of Voldemorts “trophies”, so the church seemed the next best place to look, although she had
to admit, it too was a long shot being that the only connection was that many of them had married
there, and there was no connection to Voldemort himself, as there had been in the other hiding
places. Harry too had doubted Voldemort would care for such a site, but it needed investigating just
the same, if only to rule it out.
- 157 -
So Zach had taken Hermione there on the spur of the moment one afternoon, but it had been
closed up, so he had arranged to meet her there so she could wander through at her leisure before
passing an opinion on whether she would want to wed there. Harry registered Ron’s brewing anger,
so he turned his attention on Hermione, eyeing her darkly.
‘I hope you’re not doing anything you’re … uncomfortable with to get this information, Hermione.’
Ron shot a look at her too at Harry’s question.
‘Well … I wont pretend it hasn’t had its … awkward moments,’ Harry saw her eyes seemed to grow
distant as she spoke. ‘But we have to follow it through.’ She looked at Harry, afraid to meet Rons
penetrating gaze. ‘We have to investigate every possibility. We all know what’s riding on this.’
Harry hadn’t liked the sound of her answer. ‘I’m coming with you to the church. When are you
going?’
‘This weekend.’
‘Don’t think for a minute you’re going without me.’ Ron said indignantly. ‘I’ve got a bad feeling
about all of this. I don’t think it’s going to be as easy as you think when it all turns out for naught
and you want to put Smith off.’
‘Fine. You can both come.’ Then she added quickly. ‘But I don’t want any fighting between you!
We’re all in this together, and quite frankly, I’m fed up with being caught in the middle!’
‘I wont if he doesn’t.’ Ron said bluntly.
‘This is too important to let our squabbles get in the way,’ said Harry without looking at either of
them ‘anyway, my issue is with Ginny. She’s the one I should be apologizing too. She’s the one who
needs … It’s her I want to…’
‘To forgive you?’ Hermione prompted. Harry changed the subject immediately.
‘I’m going to lunch, you coming?’
‘I’m hungry too’ Hermione got up from the chair, glaring at Ron. To Harry’s surprise, Ron rose and
made to follow them, and suddenly, with all three of them heading to the Great Hall for lunch
together, things didn’t seem as hopeless as they had.
19. Chapel of Betrayal
Harry, Ron and Hermione passed through the gates of Hogwarts on their way to the church where
most Hufflepuff graduates took their vows. The day was grey, gloomy and unwelcoming, and the air
was chilled below freezing, so they dressed in layers of clothing in an effort to shut out the cold.
They had on the warmly knitted jumpers that each of them had received from Mrs. Weasley for
Christmas last year, and their heavy winter cloaks, not to mention boots made from waterproof
Niffler fur (one of the softest and warmest skins available).
The ground was tiresomely laden with snow, which they sank almost knee deep into as they trudged
away from the gates.
‘Couldn’t we have waited for another time to do this? When we could actually walk across the
ground, rather than having to wade through it?’ Ron asked grimly.
‘No, we couldn’t!’ Harry said sharply.
‘We don’t have time Ronald.’ Hermione said. Then she stumbled suddenly, Harry grasping her arm
and yanking her to her feet, stopping her from ending up face first in snow.
- 158 -
‘Where is this place anyway?’ Ron said gloomily ‘If it’s any further North of here, I’m going back to
get your smorbal.’
‘It’s called a snorkel, and they’re used under water, not under snow! Anyway, I seriously doubt
you’ll be needing it in London!’ Hermione said wryly. ‘Stop complaining and grab my arm.’
‘I hope you know what you’re doing.’ He said to Hermione as he staggered awkwardly toward her.
‘You’ve never done a side-along before, let alone with two people.’
Ron’s sulky warning may have had more impact if it wasn’t for the fact that he had just walked
straight out of his boots, leaving them behind him embedded in the snow. Both of his big toes were
exposed through well-worn holes in his motley old socks, and holding them up in a desperate, and
fruitless attempt to avoid them touching the snow, he danced around, swearing as he tried to dig
his boots out.
‘Stop messing about, Ron!’ Hermione said impatiently. He gave her a withered look as Harry
interrupted.
‘Are you sure you can get us all there?’ he asked her.
‘Of course I can!’ she haughtily.
Ron had finally replaced his boots, though he walked as if his feet were embedded in concrete.
‘I’d rather not be splinched, if it’s at all possible. There aren’t too many parts of me that I can
spare.’ He said.
‘Especially the grey-matter type.’ Hermione quipped under her breath.
‘Look, lets just get on with it, shall we?’ Harry had been listening to Ron and Hermione taking cheap
shots at each other all week, and had had just about enough of it. Ron and Harry each gripped one
of Hermiones arms firmly and closed their eyes as the uncomfortable compression started to set in.
A few suffocating seconds later they were standing on a rather dingy looking deserted street, which
had dirty snow swept into the guttering, and several many story buildings rising either side of the
road, all in a neglected state of disrepair.
Hermione headed off immediately, crossing the street and stopping before a very old, rather plain
looking building, which was only identifiable as a church because it had a rather rusty steeple atop
of its small peak on the roof. Ron moved off to follow her, patting himself down to check all of him
had made it, while Harry stamped the excess snow off his boots, before trudging over to join them.
‘Doesn’t exactly look very romantic, does it?’ Ron smirked.
Hermione huffed without looking at them, and climbed the few stone steps, and turning the iron
ring handle, pushed the door in, disappearing into the darkness beyond.
Ron lifted his head, scanning the building glumly, before climbing the stairs and following Hermione
into the darkness beyond. Harry trailed them, his mind barely on what he was doing. The moment
he had arrived on the street opposite the church, a strange feeling had come over him, like maybe
he’d been there before.
It took a moment for Harry’s eyes to adjust to the dim light that streamed through the dirty
windows, penetrating the dusty air in the small chamber they now stood in. There were about a
dozen pews, skewed awkwardly and uncaringly before a small, plain altar that stood upon an
unassuming platform which was covered in a tatty, multicoloured carpet reminiscent of the type you
would most likely find down at the local “Horse ‘n’ Hound”, rather than a “House of God”.
Two candelabras coated with old candle wax stood upon the altar, which was shrouded in a rather
dusty, yellowed embroidered doily that was stained with what looked to be blood, but upon closer
inspection turned out to be red wine.
- 159 -
Cobwebs could be seen hanging from every arched rafter and window recess, and the worn
burgundy cushions that were thrown higgledy-piggledy across the pews looked like they might
disintegrate if anyone ever actually dared sit on one.
The drapes that hung from what appeared to be a line of three old disused confessional boxes, were
greyish and threadbare, and had chunks missing from the bottoms of them as if they had quite
literally eroded.
As Harry wandered the recesses, inspecting the old statues that were placed between each of the
windows, Ron picked up a cushion, smacking it with his hand in an effort to clean it up enough to sit
on. He had to lean back, holding the cushion at arms length, coughing and spluttering loudly, as he
choked on the dust that billowed from it.
‘Well, Hermione … this must be every girls dream.’ Ron said. She looked at him scathingly, though
as she continued to eye the dilapidated décor, Harry saw her cringe ever so slightly.
‘Maybe it just hasn’t been used in a while…’ she said, trying to sound positive, but clearly finding it
very difficult to understand what on earth Zach had been thinking. ‘Probably just needs a bit of a
clean up.’
‘A clean up?’ Ron said trying to suck in the grin that curbed his lips. ‘Nothing short of blasting it out
of existence and rebuilding would bring this place up to scratch!’ He said, obviously pleased about
something.
Harry silently agreed, but decided not to involve himself.
As he walked behind the alter, he reached out and pulled aside some worn red velvet curtains that
hung draped over a life size painting of a rather stately looking lady and her pet creature.
‘Hermione, come and have a look at this.’ He ran his fingers over the small mounds of the brush
strokes, curious as to what the animal was.
‘Ah! There you are, my angel!’ Harry and Ron spun round immediately as Hermione winced
painfully, preferring to pick up a dusty old tome from the pedestal rather than face her “intended
beau”. ‘I must apologize for being inexcusably late, mother was fussing over which tie I should
wear.’ Zach waved his hand dismissively as he waltzed over to Hermione and placed his arms firmly
around her waist.
‘I tried to point out to her when one has so many excellent ties, all one really need do is leave it to
Spider, he has the most outstanding fashion sense of any House Elf I’ve ever known.’ He leant in to
kiss Hermione’s lips, though missed and getting her cheek instead as she strategically turned her
face, flicking a page over idly.
‘And I see you have brought along one of your little friends,’ He appeared to have to drag himself
away from Hermione as he made his way over to Ron, whose face was like thunder. Ron stood up
and grabbed another cushion, and then just as Zach approached him with his hand extended, he
began beating it sadistically. Zach doubled up as he choked and wheezed, encased in a plumb of
ancient dust.
‘Oh, sorry ‘bout that.’ Ron said flatly and placed the cushion on the pew beside him. ‘Thought you
might like a seat.’
‘That’s …’ a coughing fit ensued as he tried to speak ‘quite alright…’ he said between splutters.
‘Actually,’ he cleared his throat as his eyes watered, ‘this isn’t really the best place to sit and chat.’
He returned to Hermione, once again seemingly unable to keep his hands off her as he pulled her
back to him. She was facing Harry, giving him a rather embarrassed look, when Zach finally noticed
he was there.
‘Oh,’ he said, less than enthusiastically, ‘I hadn’t realized you’d be coming.’ Harry could tell Zach
was feeling threatened by him. The story the Daily Prophet had run some time ago about he and
Hermione being an item was possibly still lingering in his mind.
- 160 -
Rather than reassure him, Harry chose to use Zach's obvious discomfort to intimidate him, not at all
happy with his need to have his hands all over her.
‘Of course. Hermione and I have known each other a long time. I want to see what she is letting
herself in for, and going by the state of this place,’ Harry let his eyes roam the dank chamber ‘it’s a
good job Ron and I came.’
Zach raised his eyebrows in surprise. ‘You can’t seriously think I’d get married in this place, let
alone subject the light of my life to such filth!’
‘Well, what are we doing here then? I thought you said this is where all the prominent Hufflepuff
marriages take place?’ Hermione struggled to turn in his firm grip to face him.
‘They do, my lovely!’ Zach said brightly. Harry could see Ron’s fists clenching and unclenching as he
watched the two of them. ‘But not in this section! This is the only part of the original church that
still stands. The street frontage has been kept the same drab way to keep the muggles out. The real
hall lays beneath.’ He finally released Hermiones waist, and grabbed her around the shoulders
instead. ‘I'll show you.’ He said smugly.
Hermione and Zach entered one of the dilapidated confessional boxes, and as Ron went to squeeze
in after them, he gave Ron a rather pompous look and directed him and Harry into an adjoining
one.
‘Press your wand tip to the small gold button next to the window grate.’ He said, and within
seconds, they could feel the floor of the boxes dropping from beneath them rapidly.
Harry and Ron steadied themselves by spreading their feet apart, but it was apparent, when they
eventually stepped out of their box, that Zach had taken the opportunity of Hermiones
unsteadiness, to pull her to him, seemingly willing to stoop to any level to keep her close.
Ron reached in and yanked her free as Zach was apparently loathed to let her go even after they
had stopped. Her face as red as Rons, and her eyes turned to the floor as Zach, for the first time
since seeing Ron and Hermione together, eyed him off challengingly. Harry removed his beanie, the
warmth of the underground hall seeping through him immediately, and keen to keep things as
pleasant as possible turned everyone’s attention to unexpected site that greeted them.
Never would he have guessed, after just descending from the neglected chamber above, that there
would be such a place of well cared for beauty, below. It was obviously a well-kept secret as there
was nothing about the outside building, which indicated that rather high society wizard weddings
took place here.
Hermione walked through entranced at the wondrously high arched ceiling that was similar to
Hogwarts Great Hall’s except instead of reflecting the weather, it housed floating cherubs who threw
flower petals from small cane baskets hung over their arms, and twinkling fairies that darted gently
to and fro, sprinkling translucent, glittering fairy dust on the four of them as they passed below.
The décor itself when they first entered, was a warm lemon colour with white and silver trim, but it
gradually faded and changed to various other colour schemes that were just as beautiful, including
lilac and palest blues with gold trims and Salmon pink and white, trimmed with a pale mushroom
cream.
Great archways enclosed the aisle to the altar, which was raised on a three-tiered platform, and was
decorated in an assortment of some of the most beautiful flowers they had ever seen. Harry
watched Hermione as she walked hypnotically to the altar, glancing at Ron every now and then to
ensure he wasn’t about to lose it and blow their cover wide open. But Ron did not seem aggravated
or ready to explode at all, which was surprising in an even more disturbing way than if he had
looked livid. Instead he looked crest-fallen as he sat down dejectedly in one of the beautifully ornate
pews, which along with the rest of the décor kept changing colour.
Harry, feeling it safe to do some real looking around, ventured off around the hall, inspecting every
statue and icon, including the stained glass windows which were lit from behind magically as they
were underground. He went over the altar, the pews, and even the small rooms off to the side, but
- 161 -
he found nothing out of the ordinary.
‘Does it always do this?’ Hermione asked dreamily at the colour variations.
‘Oh no,’ Zach said as he came up behind her, obviously over the moon at her reaction. ‘This has
been set up so that we can choose any colour scheme you want. On the day it will stay the way you
choose.’ Hermione was still staring at the ceiling. Zach spun her around to face him, and positioned
his face within inches of hers.
‘You can have it any way you want. It’ll be everything you ever dreamed of.’ He bent his head to
close the small gap, and kissed her. She kissed him back for a moment, seemingly swept up in it
all, but then she pulled away from him quite suddenly. Harry just made out her mouthing “not now”
to Zach, before he saw Ron rise and make his way back over to the confessional boxes.
Moving swiftly to intercept him, Harry yanked him inside one of the booths. ‘C’mon Ron, you know
she doesn’t like that prat! She’s doing all of this so we can find the cup.’
‘I can never offer her all of this Harry. I’ll never be able to make her happy like he could. You know
it as well as I do. She’d be better off with someone like him.’ He said gravely.
‘I think you’re reading more into this than there is. So she likes the chapel, but you and I both know
Hermione’s not that shallow.’
'You two ready to go back?’ Zach pulled the curtain back, eyeing them curiously, Hermione still
firmly by his side.
‘Yeah,' said Ron, his eyes seemingly unable to meet Hermiones.
‘What about you?’ Zach turned to Hermione. ‘Ready beautiful?’ Hermione nodded and they entered
the booth next to Ron and Harry, and all of them began their ascent.
After being in the pristinely magical surrounds of the chapel underground, the chamber above
looked even worse than it had before.
‘I’ve got to head back, if I’m not back within the hour, mother will have half the wizarding world out
looking for me.’ Zach tried to move in on Hermione again, but this time she was not so distracted,
and stepped towards the door so she could usher him away quickly. She gave Harry a meaningful
look, and he followed her closely, dragging Ron by the sleeve of his jacket until Zach grudgingly let
her go, and disapparated.
‘Did you find anything?’ Hermione directed her question at Harry, as it was clear Ron wasn’t likely to
be particularly receptive.
‘No,’ Harry said, his voice laced with disappointment as he replaced his beanie. ‘At least not down in
the new section, though I didn’t really get much of a chance to check the old part out thoroughly.’
‘I imagine we’ll be back,’ Ron goaded. ‘Hermione’s gonna wanna pick her colour scheme yet.’
‘You’re so right as usual Ronald!’ She said angrily, her voice dripping with sarcasm ‘That’s exactly
why I’ll need to come back. Its always been a dream of mine to get married at the age of
seventeen.’ Then as an after thought, ‘If I’m really lucky I’ll be pregnant before I even leave
Hogwarts!’ Her anger was raising her voice to almost a shrill. ‘No need to study ever again, I’ll just
stay at home like the good little wifie, bringing up a dozen screaming little brats. Still, there is one
upside, none of them are likely to have red hair!’ Ron scowled as he kicked the crumbling little
stonewall, sending a cloud of dust into the air.
‘You won’t need to worry about that, that’s for sure! Why don’t you and Harry head back together?’
He said nastily ‘I think I’ll stop in at the Three Broomsticks for a while. I hear Madame Rosmerta’s
been asking after me since the battle of Hogsmeade. Seamus says she’s been wanting to thank me,
and I think its about time I took her up on it!’
‘Hah!’ Hermione mocked. ‘Fine!’
- 162 -
‘Fine!’ Ron returned angrily and started to walk off, but in their need for someone to back them up
and justify their behaviour, they both noticed Harry was no longer with them.
He was heading determinedly down the street, now some distance from the two of them, eyeing a
rather grim, square looking building, surrounded by high railings that had a set of iron gates leading
to a baron looking courtyard.
‘Harry! Where are you going?’ She asked rather testily.
Harry continued on in the same direction, nearing the building that seemed to draw him hypnotically
towards it.
‘Harry!’ Hermione’s voice was becoming more urgent now. ‘What are you doing?’
‘Oi! Mate, what are looking at?’ Ron was yelling.
As Harry approached the building, he was unable to speak, unable to answer their calls. Pulling up
before the large iron gates, he placed a gloved hand on one of the bars as if by touching it, it would
become undeniably real.
He could hear Ron and Hermione’s footsteps quickening as they came up behind him, but he could
not yet draw his gaze from the deadened building. The minute his eyes had fallen upon it, he knew
he had seen it before. In fact, he had not only seen it before, he had been there.
Ron and Hermione were panting as they came to a halt at the gates, trying to understand what it
was that had held Harry’s attention so completely.
‘What?’ Ron breathed as he bent over and placed his hands on his knees, the cold air making it all
the more difficult to draw in breath.
‘This is it’ Harry said, almost not daring to speak it aloud, both his gloved hands now clutching at
the cold metal bars on the gate.
‘This is what?’ Hermione said, breathing heavily as her eyes roamed over the impossibly dull
building.
Harry let go of the gate and took a step back, taking it all in. ‘This is where Tom Riddle grew up.’ He
still spoke as if he said it too loud, it would disappear.
‘What?’ Ron said unbelievably as he straightened to get a better look.
‘Are you sure?’ Hermione too, had taken to almost whispering, whether following Harry’s lead, or
more likely, was awed at the realization that this was the place where the darkest wizard of all time
had spent his childhood.
‘This is the orphanage Dumbledore came to when he offered Riddle a place at Hogwarts.’ Harry still
couldn’t quite believe he was suddenly faced with it. ‘This is where he brought me in the pensieve.’
All three of them stood silently watching the building for a time, and then Harry took a step forward
to the gates and lifted the latch. It creaked open ominously as he passed through it.
‘What are you doing?’ Hermione half whispered.
‘It looks like someone still lives here’ Harry said as he craned his neck back, staring up at a small
light on in one of the third floor windows.
‘So what if they do?’ Ron was also whispering, obviously affected by the disturbing history of the
place. ‘How’s that going to help us find…’ he cut himself off before blurting out aloud the reason
they had come.
Harry ignored them and made his way up the few stairs to the door, and lifting his hand, hesitating
- 163 -
for the tiniest moment, he knocked lightly, looking back at Ron and Hermione standing outside the
gate. He waited with great anticipation, but no answer came.
He knocked again, more forcefully this time, and waited. It was becoming obvious that no one was
in, and just as he started to descend the stairs, he heard the rough clanging of a massive bolt being
slid open on the other side of the door. Abruptly it swung inwards, revealing a rather skinny, frail
old woman.
She had grizzled grey hair that stuck out in all directions from a poorly twisted bun, and a number
of spiky looking grey whiskers protruding from her chin. Her rather wrinkled features seemed to
bare the weight of a hard life, and her clothing was drab to the extreme, yet was overlaid in stark
contrast by a bright floral apron that seemed glaringly inappropriate.
‘Yes?’ she demanded in a crackly old voice, somewhat out of breath.
‘Oh, er … I don’t mean to bother you-'
‘Of course you do! Why else would you come knocking on my door?’ As she spoke, she showed her
crooked, yellowed teeth that looked like they were barely hanging from her receding gums, and in
between those crooked, yellowed teeth, were black gaps where it seemed that some of her teeth
had finally lost the battle to cling on.
Harry tried to avoid looking at it.
‘Er … um, I-I was just wondering if you know anything about the orphanage that used to be here?’
The woman paused for the longest time, just staring at him, and then a small smile crept across her
crooked mouth.
‘What’s your name boy?’
Harry didn't know if this woman was muggle or witch, but with his beanie on his scar was hidden
out of sight. ‘Harry’ He said ‘Harry Potter.’
‘Of course you are!’ she said. She glanced around him at the two teenagers hovering at the gate.
‘Friends of yours?’ she said accusingly.
‘Er … yeah,’
‘Well, its all the same to me if they want to wait out here in the cold.’ She held the door open just
enough to allow Harry to pass through, and as he stepped over the threshold, he looked back
nervously at Ron and Hermione. They exchanged glances and walked slowly to the open door as
Harry disappeared behind it. The iron-gate clanged shut behind them, making them both jump as
they half glanced over their shoulders.
‘Well, come on then!’ the old woman crackled impatiently. ‘You get to my age, you don’t have time
to be waitin’ on people as slow as you two!’
Ron turned to Hermione, all thoughts of their previous pettiness forgotten. ‘I’m not sure this is such
a good idea.’ He said under his breath as they continued to approach slowly. ‘There’s something
about her-’
‘You don’t trust?’ Hermione finished, looking just as apprehensive. But with Harry already inside,
what choice did they have? They mounted the stairs, and Ron, taking Hermione by the arm, all the
while placing himself between her and the grizzled old woman, entered to hallway. The door was
slammed shut and bolted behind them.
~*~*~*~*~
Harry stood in the familiar black and white tiled entry hall, staring up the stone stairs, pulling off his
- 164 -
gloves, half expecting the younger looking Dumbledore and the eleven year old Tom Riddle to come
strolling down towards them. But it appeared the place was empty now, though it had an
unpleasant smell that reminded Harry of Mrs. Figgs, the squib that lived down the street from the
Dursleys. The frazzled old woman was watching Harry silently as he shoved his gloves idly in his
cloak pocket and pulled off his beanie. Tom’s old room was up there somewhere, just meters from
where he now stood.
Without realizing it, Harry’s hand had gripped the balustrade, and he had one foot already on the
lower step as if he were about to climb the stairs. Then, as his face turned to the second landing, an
unnaturally cold draft seemed to pass right through him. His hair ruffled almost unnoticeably
causing a shudder to ripple down his spine as he felt the breath leave him momentarily.
‘Harry?’ Hermione came up beside him, but even her familiar voice was unable to drag his eyes
from the floor above. ‘What is it?’
‘Didn’t you feel it?’ he breathed.
‘What?’ she frowned as she followed his gaze. Ron joined them at the foot of the stairs.
‘What are you looking at?’ He asked, watching their expressions.
‘Look if you will, that’s why you’re here isn’t it?’ The woman’s gravely voice drew all of them to turn
their heads and look at her. Her lips curled into a dry smile as she looked directly at Harry. ‘I wish I
could be of more help dear, but you wont find anything. This place has been empty for more than
sixteen years. There’s nothing here now but some useless old furniture, plenty of cobwebs and…’
she trailed off.
‘And what?’ Harry dropped to the foot of the stairs again as he turned to face her. ‘There is
something else here too, I know. What is it?’
‘What makes you think so?’ she said, smiling as she raised an eyebrow. Harry’s eyes narrowed.
‘Because I can feel it.’
The old woman cackled at Harry’s words. ‘It is not my place to understand what may lurk here.’ Her
laughter died as quickly as it had been born. ‘As Dumbledore knew well.’
‘Dumbledore?’ Harry asked ‘He put you here?’
‘He did.’ Harry had the impression she did not like Dumbledore.
‘What do you know about this place?’ He pushed.
‘It was an orphanage once.’
‘And the Chapel down the road?’ Harry asked intently. The woman’s mild expression changed at the
mention of the chapel. Her face dropped.
‘I know nothing about the Chapel.’ She said flatly.
‘But it would have been the local chapel for the orphanage, wouldn’t it?’ Hermione asked innocently.
‘That was before my time. For all I know, they never visited the chapel.’ The woman eyed Hermione
out of the corner of her eye.
‘Why are you here?’ Harry asked her ‘What did Dumbledore ask of you?’
‘He told me to mind the place. Watch over it. He knew that you would come.’ She said slyly.
‘How is that possible?’ Harry interjected abruptly. ‘I didn’t know myself until just now when I
stumbled onto the place by accident.’
- 165 -
The old woman seemed to grow nervously impatient at Harry’s continued questioning. She waved
her hand at the stairway.
‘The room you seek is on the first floor, third door to the right.’
Harry watched the woman for a moment, eyeing her curiously as she avoided his gaze, before
turning back to the stone steps.
‘Don’t take too long, dear!’ she said in a falsely honeyed voice as Hermione and Ron fell in behind
Harry.
They climbed the stone stairs as if it were the last thing they wanted to do. When they reached the
first landing, Harry glanced over his shoulder to see if the woman had followed them, but she was
nowhere in sight.
‘She lied.’ Harry said as he looked down the hallway.
‘What are you talking about?’ Hermione asked in a hoarse whisper.
‘She lied about where Tom Riddle’s room was.’ Harry was speaking softly so that the three of them
had to crowd their heads together.
‘How do you know?’ asked Ron.
‘I went to Riddle’s room with Dumbledore when he brought me here in the pensieve. It’s off the
second landing, not the first, and it was the first door.’
‘But Dumbledore put her here. Why would she lie?’ Hermione asked sceptically.
‘I don’t know.’
‘Maybe she wasn’t lying.’ They both turned to look at Ron ‘I mean, yeah, she’s a bit weird, I know,’
Weird was putting it mildly as far as Harry was concerned. ‘But maybe she doesn’t know you’re here
to see Riddle’s room.’
‘If Dumbledore put her here, she would know why I came.’ Harry stated darkly.
‘Maybe the room you should be looking at is that one down there.’ Ron continued as he motioned
his head to the doorway. ‘Not Riddle’s old room at all.’
Harry went quiet as he thought about what Ron had said. But it didn’t seem right. Something told
him it was Riddles room that would be the only important place here to both Harry and Voldemort.
‘What do we do?’ Hermione’s whispers were getting quieter, but more urgent. Harry looked about
him for a moment.
‘Ron, you wait outside the door down there,’ Harry pointed to the chipped and flaky wooden third
door down the hallway. ‘And whatever you do, do not go into that room! Hermione, you come with
me.’ Harry started to move off towards the stairs again.
‘Hang on, what am I supposed to do if she comes up looking for you?’ Ron asked.
‘Hold her off with chit-chat… and if that doesn’t work …’ Harry winced as he shrugged ‘Hex her.’ He
continued up the stairs with Hermione in tow.
‘Great!’ They could hear Ron mumbling as he headed down the passageway. ‘Hex an old woman
that Dumbledore put here to guard the place!’ he scoffed ‘Brilliantly cunning plan.’ His voice trailed
off as Harry and Hermione stopped in front of the first door after quietly making their way to the
second landing.
Harry put his hand on the door handle.
- 166 -
‘WAIT!’ Hermione reached out and placed her hand over his to stop him from turning the handle. ‘If
this is Tom Riddle’s old room, and that old woman didn’t want us to get in here, then maybe its
protected.’ Harry looked into her worried eyes and pulled his hand away.
‘Hermione, I have to get in there.’ He knew there was a link, a reason the Hufflepuff chapel had led
him straight to the orphanage where Riddle grew up. As they stood there, the temperature dropped
dramatically, and Harry shuddered, grabbing Hermione’s arm.
‘Can you feel that?’
‘What?’ she was studying his face, trying to work out what it was he was talking about.
‘Cold.’ He said. Hermione looked down and saw the Goosebumps on his wrist above the hand that
gripped her.
'Are you all right?'
‘I have been waiting for you, Harry Potter.’
A chilling voice that seemed to come from no direction in particular, swept around Harry and echoed
through him.
‘Who are you?’ he asked, his heartbeat racing as his head turned, urgently seeking the source of the
ghostly being. His eyes fell on Hermione, who by the way she was looking at him, had heard
nothing.
‘I am the one who will help you into his room, and I ask for only one thing in return.’ The voice
rasped as the cold seeped through Harry’s thick clothing. His breath was coming out frosted as he
started to shiver.
‘What?’
‘Harry, are you okay?’ Hermione was watching him as he clasped his arms about him, shrinking in
the cold.
‘You must avenge my trust in him. You must swear ... no matter what the cost to you ... you will
destroy him!’
The voice hissed in what sounded like a hundred whispering voices. Harry lowered his head as
images of the people Harry cared about flashed before him, lingering on Ginny.
‘I can't.’ He whispered.
‘Harry!’ Hermione had his face in her hands, trying to get him to look at her.
‘Swear it, and you shall enter!’
‘Harry! Look at me!’
Harry pulled his gaze to meet hers. He rallied every ounce of strength and conviction from her
compassion for him.
‘I'll do it.’ He said, still shaking. ‘Whatever it costs me ... I swear.’
‘Who are you talking to? What are promising?’ Hermione persisted.
‘Once I disarm the room, my job is done. You will be on your own.’
The voice passed through him again.
‘Who are you? Are you a ghost?’ Harry repeated.
- 167 -
‘I am the true heir of what you seek. I am neither ghost, nor living. I bargained my death away so I
could carry out this one task ... You will know when it is time to enter.’
‘Harry! What’s happening? Who are you talking to?’ Hermione’s urgent voice penetrated Harry’s
concentration as the terrible coldness left him.
A whooshing sound came from inside the room and directly after, a flash of bright light splayed out
from under the gap in the door. Hermione was gripping Harry’s arm painfully as they both waited.
The room was silent.
‘It’s time.’ Harry said, prying Hermiones hand off his arm. ‘You wait here.’
‘Harry. No way!’ She said frowning at him. ‘You don’t know what’s waiting for you beyond that
door!’ He gave Hermione a reassuring look.
‘Its okay to enter now, and I’d rather you were here keeping an eye out, just in case.’
She nodded resignedly. ‘Be careful.’
He reached out and turned the small round brass handle, and as it squeaked with apparent disuse,
Harry took a deep breath and stepped over the threshold, easing the door open. The first thing he
noticed lying in the middle of the floor was a distorted image of a shadowy transparent body that
still had some solidity to it. Truly it was neither ghost nor living, and yet now that it had form, Harry
knew who it was immediately.
He trod carefully around the figure and headed straight to the wardrobe. He opened it not nearly as
apprehensively as he perhaps should have, already knowing that he would not find what he was
looking for in such an obvious place. He then made a thorough search of the entire room, which
because of the spells that had guarded it, was exactly as it had been when Harry had visited it in
the pensieve. After maybe five minutes of rummaging around in the scantily furnished bedroom, he
sat on the dusty, squeaky bed, defeated.
What was he looking for? It was the first time he had bothered to ask himself the question, relying
purely on instinct that something had drawn him there. Not the cup, certainly not here. As he sat,
his thoughts turned to what it must have been like for Riddle to grow up in such a place. It was
grimmer even than where Harry himself had been raised, but the similarities were undeniable.
He thought about how many times Riddle must have sat on the edge of this bed wondering why he
didn’t fit in, which in some strange way seemed to mirror his own existence. He couldn’t count how
many times he had sat on the edge of his bed wishing he had been anywhere else. Knowing he was
treated differently from those around him. Knowing he had his secrets.
Secrets.
Harry had his secrets as a boy, and had found what he thought was an ideal hiding place for them,
and it had even proved to be just that as his spot was never discovered in the whole time he had
used it. Without hesitating, he dropped onto his knees and inspected the floorboards underneath
the bed. They were laden with years of dust, and to Harry’s disappointment, they appeared to be
smooth and even, and showed no signs of tampering with.
He ran his hands along the boards, collecting dust and feeling for anything that might indicate a
slight anomaly, something that may indicate he was right, that he and Tom shared more in common
than either of them could ever have imagined. He flicked off the sticky fluff that clung to his fingers,
and his thumb jabbed painfully into a floorboard, and as he brought it up to his face to inspect the
damage, he noticed the board he had hit was sitting slightly raised at one end. His thumb forgotten,
he leaned under the bed and jiggled the board until it finally came loose in his hand. Lifting it away,
he felt somewhat daunted at the similarities between himself and Voldemort.
It was a short while before he could bring himself to look into the cavity, though it was impossible
to see anything in the darkness under the bed, so Harry pushed the bed aside, its metal legs
scraping noisily across the floor. Just as he was about to reach his hand in, Hermione poked her
- 168 -
head around the door.
‘Is everything okay?’ she asked with a worried look on her face.
‘Fine. Keep an eye out, I wont be much longer.’
‘Okay. And Harry…’ she stopped midway from closing the door. ‘Be careful.’ He smiled, not really
understanding what he thought was so amusing, but as soon as she closed the door, he reached his
hand back in and felt around with his fingers.
His finger hit upon something that felt almost like nothing. He might have missed it but it was
slightly lumpy, though short, yet flat as well, almost like paper, yet not paper. He scrambled his
fingers around it until he had a firm grip and lifted it out, not knowing what to expect, yet definitely
not expecting what he brought out of the dark hole, and into the light near his face. He pocketed
them immediately, then placed his hand back into the open space, but unable to detect anything
else, he replaced the floorboard and bed, and headed for the door, again looking at the shadowy
figure on the floor.
Her face, which from the position of her body Harry would have expected to be contorted in pain,
was instead peaceful looking. A slight smile curled her lips below her eyes that were open, but not
looking surprised or shocked at her demise, instead looking satisfied, like she had achieved
something that had been a long time in the making. Harry walked to the door and turned to take
one last look at what was once Hepzibah Smith, before turning the handle and being faced
immediately with Hermiones concerned expression.
‘I think its time we gott out of here.’ He said.
‘Did you find anything?’
‘I don’t know. I got something, but I don’t know if it will help. I’ll show you later, but we need to get
out of here. Have you heard anything from downstairs?’
‘No.’ she said ‘but I agree we can’t afford to stay any longer.’
They collected Ron who was still standing outside the third door on the first floor, looking rather
relieved to see them, and as they reached the bottom of the stone steps, they had expected to be
accosted by the old woman, but she was conspicuously absent.
Taking advantage of the moment, Harry led Ron and Hermione to the front door. Unbolting it, they
headed down the few stairs to the metal gate they had entered through. Once it closed behind
them, they all breathed more easily as they followed Harry back down the street.
‘What are we doing going back there?’ Ron asked as he looked up at the steeple.
‘I don’t know. But I found something in Riddles room, and I'll just bet it’s got something to do with
finding the cup.’
‘Yeah, well fine.’ Said Ron. ‘But why here? Why the Chapel? We’ve already been through this place.’
He said, then turning to Hermione he added. ‘Unless of course, Hermione just can’t stay away.’
‘You know Ron, you can be such a-’
‘This has got nothing to do with Hermione.’ Harry cut her off before a full on war broke out. ‘There’s
a reason why the orphanage is so close to the chapel. Hermione was right, they must have used
this chapel for the kids in the orphanage, and it’s the perfect place for Tom Riddle to identify
Hufflepuff with.’ Harry crossed the road to the chapel, Hermione at his heels, and Ron walking
sulkily some paces behind them.
The three of them climbed the stone steps and Harry turned the ring handle to let them in. As
before it took a few minutes for their eyes to adjust to the darkness, but Harry was on a mission
this time. He knew somewhere here there was the connection he was looking for. He took the strips
from his pocket that he had retrieved from under riddles bed, and lit his wand to study them more
closely. They were short, black and flat, but with a slightly lumpy texture, and had a small hole in
one end of each of them. Hermione and Ron peered over his shoulder to see what it was he was so
- 169 -
interested in, and when he explained to them it was what he had come out of Riddle’s room with,
both of them exchanged dubious glances. Harry sighed.
‘Look, I know it doesn’t look like much, but it has to mean something. Why would he go to all the
trouble of protecting the room, and hiding them so well if they were rubbish?’ He was saying it as
much to convince him as them.
‘So what should we do?’ Ron asked. ‘Keep looking up here?’ he took his wand out and lit it too.
‘I don’t think he would have left the cup in the new section, it just seems … unlike him. I think he
would have hidden it somewhere that had a bit more history to it.’ Harry started to walk around the
recesses again, eyeing the statues, looking for any clue as to where the two slightly rough black
strips he held in his hand could possibly fit. Ron wandered up the centre of the aisle between the
pews, and Hermione, who had also lit her wand, took the other side of the chapel.
They walked around for what seemed like ages, in such a small space, and found nothing, no clue
what so ever. Hermione suggested that she go back in one of the booths to check the new part out
again, but Ron immediately volunteered himself, and rushed into one of the confessional boxes as if
nothing would give him greater pleasure. Harry had to smile as he watched Ron descend. He knew
why Ron had gone down there. He was afraid if Hermione saw the chapel in all its glory one more
time, it might just be enough to tip her over the edge.
With Ron gone, Hermione and Harry teamed up and went over everything again as they had before,
still at a loss to figure out where the two stripes might fit in. They had pretty much given up, and
were waiting for Ron to return, when Harry pulled back the red velvet curtains to the painting he
had looked at the first time he had come in, and once again studied the stately looking woman and
the unusual looking creature that was barely visible, poking out from underneath her extravagantly
flowing pale yellow dress she was adorned in. Hermione scanned the picture, running her wand light
over it to get a better look.
‘Strange isn’t it?’ she said.
‘You mean the fact that it’s in such good condition compared to everything else in here?’ Harry had
noticed it too.
‘What’s that?’ Hermione poked her wand light at the creature, whose only visible part was its face.
‘I don’t know, looks a bit like a ferret.’ Harry chuckled as he thought of Malfoys time as a ferret.
‘Harry, give me those stripes!’ Hermione said seriously. Harry handed them over, and as he did so it
occurred to him why she wanted them.
‘You don’t think…?’ He watched as she placed them over the creatures face so that they ran down
along the nose, and the eyes fitted perfectly into the holes at the tip of each one. Without any
obvious means of adhesive, they stuck there perfectly, like they belonged. Now that they were
there, it looked liked they were never missing.
‘It’s a badger!’ Harry said, and just as he leaned in to take a closer look, the painting seemed to
dissolve almost completely before there eyes. There was still a faded outline of the picture, almost
as if looking through a printed fly wire, but it no longer presented a solid barrier, and as Hermione
stuck her wand tip through the portal, they heard Ron emerging from one of the booths, mumbling
grumpily about having buckets of glowing fairy dust dumped on him as he dusted himself off.
‘Bloody Hell!’ Was all that Ron managed as he came up behind them and looked at the portal.
‘Guess you figured out what the stripes were all about then?’
‘I can’t see a thing beyond the veil, Harry.’ Hermione was still waving her wand around, but it
reflected nothing on the other side of the screen.
‘I’ll go first.’ Said Harry ‘Wait for me to give you the okay that it’s alright to come through.’ He
stepped through the veil and disappeared from sight.
- 170 -
It was pitch black on the other side of the portal, except for the dim light that seeped through the
screen, and Harry was treading slowly around the edge of the portal to make way for the others
when his foot slipped. He caught himself just in time, but he realized that beyond the narrow ledge
he was standing on, there appeared to be a deep cavern, an endless drop where the few pieces of
stone he had knocked of the shelf with his foot did not seem to reach a bottom, they just appeared
to drop, and keep on dropping. Harry’s heartbeat quickened as he slammed himself against the side
of the black stone wall. It took a moment for him to catch his breath before he called for Ron. He
yelled for him to come slowly and carefully, and to stick to the side, so as Ron crept through the
painting, he too inched his way along the opposite side to Harry, who then called Hermione.
As she stepped through eager at their discovery, her foot caught on the picture frame, and she fell
through the portal with such sudden awkwardness that both Ron and Harry had a job to grab one of
her arms each. She hung above the inky and seemingly endless blackness, both of them gripping
her desperately. She was looking up at them with a horrified expression on her face as he legs
dangled helplessly, unable to stop herself from glancing down, and terrifying herself even more.
‘Hold on!’ Ron said in a shaky voice as he tried to stop his grip from slipping, whilst still clinging to
the wall behind him.
‘And don’t look down!’ Harry added, then looking at Ron, he said ‘Ron we’ll pull her up on the count
of three. Ready?’ Ron nodded, but his grip slipped as his eyes widened in fear so that now he had
hold of her by her wrist only. Hermione let out a terrified shreak.
‘I wont let you go!’ Ron sounded determined and Harry had no doubt in his mind Ron would rather
fall with her than let go of her hand.
‘On three.’ Harry said. ‘One … Two … Three!’ They both pulled with all their might. Hermione used
her feet to help push herself up the side of the rock wall. As she came higher, both Harry and Ron
let go of the wall to grab her under the arms and pull her to the safety of the ledge. The minute she
found her feet, she threw her arms around Ron’s neck and clung to him as if her life still depended
on it.
‘Are you okay?’ He asked quietly, one arm around her shoulder and the other softly on the back of
her hair. She pulled away nodding, quiet tears dripping down her face that even Harry could see in
the dim light. The three of them stood there for a moment, shaken by what had nearly happened. It
was Ron who spoke first.
‘You should wait on the other side Hermione.’ It was less of a request and more of an order, but to
Harry’s surprise she did not take offence.
‘I’m fine, really!’ she said quietly ‘Anyway, it looks like you’re going to need me.’
Harry would have felt much more comfortable knowing Hermione was out of danger, but he also
knew she was right. They had only just passed through and were already stuck. He knew they were
definitely going to need Hermione's skills to figure this one out.
‘There must be a way across!’ Harry said in frustration.
‘There will be, but it’ll be hidden, we’ve just got to figure out how.’ Hermione seemed to gather her
wits extremely rapidly under the circumstances. ‘Maybe we should edge around a bit further.’ So
they set off. Harry went off to the left, and Hermione followed Ron to the right. ‘Use your wands!’
Hermione said, but as they drew them and tried to light them, nothing happened, it seemed they
didn’t work in the bottomless chamber. They crept further apart, but there appeared to be no way
across.
‘This is useless! What we need is some sort of light, a way of showing us where the path is!’ Ron
said loudly so as Harry could hear him.
‘Hang on!’ Hermione said. Harry tried to look at Hermione, who had that wonderful tone that crept
into her voice when one of her brilliant ideas emerged. ‘Ron, do you have any more of that fairy
dust?’
- 171 -
‘What?’ he said screwing his face up.
‘Fairy dust! Do you have anymore on you anywhere?’
‘I dusted it off, why?’
‘Check your pockets, anywhere it might have gotten caught in your clothing!’ she said growing more
urgent. She started checking her own, and managed to come out with some tiny smatterings of the
magically glowing dust. Ron started pulling handfuls of it out of his pockets.
‘They went nuts when I was down there last time, I’m telling you!’ he said as he dumped it into
Hermiones beanie, which she had removed for the purpose of collecting as much of it as she could.
Once Ron had emptied all of his clothing. Hermione took a small pinch of it and threw it into the
chasm.
‘What d’ya do that for?’ Ron said incredulously, but Harry had already caught on, and searching his
own clothing, he pulled out some small pinches and began throwing into the darkness before him,
moving around slowly and throwing a little more each time, with Hermione doing the same thing
some distance away.
‘I'VE GOT IT!’ Hermiones excited voiced echoed through the chasm and Harry looked up to see that
lying at Hermiones feet was indeed a pathway of sorts. Lit by the translucent glowing dust, it looked
incredibly narrow, and as she threw more of the fairy dust further out, the path seemed to dip
slightly, the drop off again. ‘Follow me!’ Hermione said as she stepped out onto the path, ignoring
both Ron and Harry’s protests as she sprinkled the dust sparingly, revealing a stone stairway that
descended for some distance as they followed it.
Harry could see by the light of the glowing dust that Ron was looking rather green, so Harry
followed closely behind him, in case he started to lose his balance. Down and down the stairs went,
turning left then right, all the while headed away from where they had come in. Hermione was just
beginning to think she might run out of the magical light when they rounded a giant column, which
they had been circling for some time, and spotted an opening.
‘Through here!’ she said as she rushed on.
‘Hermione! Wait!’ Harry yelled after her. He was as keen to get off the narrow stairs as she was, but
they had no idea what they were walking into. Ron appeared unable to talk; possibly afraid he
would lose his breakfast if he did, so he followed silently, edging along, until he too reached the
opening.
As Harry followed, his scar panged painfully as his eyes adjusted to light. It appeared Hermione had
already lit the old-fashioned flame torches, which hung from the dank stone brick walls. She was
standing in the middle of the room looking around her in tense awe. Ron too appeared glued to the
spot as he eyed the threatening ancient fixtures that littered the stone cellar. As Harry was looking
around him, clutching at his scar, a very bad feeling was creeping over him. This was not safe, this
was a set up, and he knew it was a trap from the moment he laid eyes on the dungeon.
‘GET OUT! NOW!’ He roared at his two friends, but it was too late.
Suddenly the grate Ron had been standing on dropped out from beneath him. Ron dropped out of
sight as the grate slammed back into place. He groaned painfully, and seconds later his fingers were
sticking through the metal mesh, and incredibly, his wand was speeding through the air and out of
sight. As Harry ran to him and wrapped his hands around the rusty iron, pulling at it with all his
strength, he was interrupted by Hermione's screams. An enormously loud metal clanging sound
accompanied her wails, and as he looked, he could see Hermione being encased in a metal cage
that immediately closed in on her, making her jump as the base slid across under her feet. The cage
was then yanked roughly high in the air as Hermione clung to it.
‘GET HERMIONE!’ yelled Ron. He could see her in the cage as it swung wildly. She was trying to
cling onto it but was being buffeted around as she gasped, falling against the harsh metal bars until
she was thrown to the bottom of the cage.
- 172 -
‘HERMIONE!’ Harry pulled out his wand as he winced with the pain of his scar, but it shot out of his
hand instantly, and then to his horror he felt heavy iron cuffs clamping themselves around his
ankles, and huge, thick iron chains that were attached, were pulling him forcefully to the wall. Other
metal chains with cuffs on the ends were flying through mid air towards his arms as he fought to
avoid them. But it was no use. His wrists were clamped and drawn roughly backwards until they
were secured severely against the cold stone wall, along with his feet, which were spread a small
distance from one another.
The pain from the overly tight wrist and ankle clamps, and the thick, heavy chains that were
pressed tightly against him was searing into his flesh, but he had little concern for himself. He
yanked his head back to see if Hermione was okay, but it appeared she had been knocked out and
was still lying awkwardly on the bottom of her harsh metal prison. Harry looked down at Ron, his
fingers were still poking through the grating.
‘HERMIONE! HARRY!’ he called urgently.
‘I’m … here … Ron…’ Harry was finding it difficult to speak, not only from the pain, but he had been
winded as he had crashed into the stone wall behind him. He looked back up at Hermione. A painful
groan escaped her lips, and Harry's relief that she was okay was short lived as he saw her wand fly
from the cage and into the hands of a sight that quite literally took his breath away.
20. Ice of Hatred
A figure seemed to almost glide towards Harry from out of the shadows as chilling terror struck
through him. Tall and thin, robed in black with an inhumanly white face, and venomous red eyes
that shone eerily against the darkness that lurked behind him. His slit-like nostrils flared slightly as
he closed in on Harry, a satisfied smile sitting lightly on his thin lips as he stopped close enough to
touch Harry.
Harry's scar burned furiously as he closed his eyes and tried to apparate out of his bonds, but
nothing happened. No familiar compression, no suffocating feeling. When he opened them again, he
was staring straight at Voldemort.
Harry’s wide eyes and rapid breathing appeared to be amusing Lord Voldemort.
‘You cannot simply appear and disappear in here.’ He said in his cold, rasping voice. ‘What would be
the point of setting such an elaborate trap?’ He had all three of their wands grasped in one hand,
and his own in the other, and without taking his eyes off Harry for a second, he spoke to someone
in the darkness behind him.
‘Take these!’ he said aggressively, holding the trio’s wands out to the side of him ‘And do not be
foolish enough to leave them in here.’ Harry watched as a much shorter, slumped figure emerged.
It was the woman from the orphanage. She approached Voldemort in a semi-bowed position, and
after taking the wands, backed away from him subserviently.
‘Yes, My Lord’ her crackling voice shook in fear as she disappeared through a narrow, arched
doorway opposite the one Harry had come through.
‘Harry?’ Ron’s voice came from the pit, squeaky and unsure. Harry suddenly felt sick. He knew Ron
couldn’t possibly see who was standing in the room with them from where he was, and he had
never heard Voldemorts voice before. Voldemorts eyes left Harry’s slowly, his head tilting in the
direction of the pit as his faint look of amusement dissolved.
‘The-The old woman, sh-she was a traitor!’ Harry accused Voldemort desperately in an unsteady
voice. It was the first thing that came to mind to stop Voldemort from turning his attention on Ron.
Voldemort’s sinister eyes flicked back to Harry.
‘Sh-she told you we were here.’ Harry continued quickly ‘She betrayed us. She betrayed
- 173 -
Dumbledore’s trust, just like Snape!’ Anger was seeping into his voice now, though he was still filled
with terror.
Voldemort’s smile returned, his harsh lips parting as he let out an indulgently icy laugh that sent
chills down Harry’s spine.
‘It would seem your famous protector had it wrong yet again. But alas,’ Voldemort flicked his hand
airily as amusement sparked in his eyes ‘that is not the case. The woman from the orphanage was
loyal to Dumbledore … to the last.’ He was still smiling evilly as Harry shrunk under Voldemort’s
gaze.
‘Wormtail!’ Voldemort called, but yet again, did not remove his eyes from Harry. Harry saw the old
woman return, her eyes nervously on the floor as she approached, not looking at Lord Voldemort, or
at Harry. Harry waited for the treacherous Pettigrew to show, dreading his return.
Then he understood.
The figure standing half-hidden behind Voldemort was not the woman Dumbledore had entrusted to
mind the orphanage. It was Peter Pettigrew who was fidgeting nervously with his hands.
‘Yes Master?’ the old woman’s voice came out because of the polyjuice potion, but with the
realization, Harry only saw the man who had betrayed his parents to their deaths. His fear was
being overcast by his rage at Pettigrew. Still wincing from the pain his scar ached with, Harry’s jaw
stiffened and his eyes narrowed and he could feel his blood burning with fury.
‘Ah yes,’ Voldemort hissed softly. He was watching Harry’s every reaction intently. ‘Now you
understand. I see the desire that fills you. I wonder,’ He paused to flash a look at Wormtail. ‘If I
were to release you and give you your wand, would you kill him?’
Harry’s eye’s turned on Voldemort as hatred coursed through his veins. ‘Do it, and find out.’ He
ground out, his gaze being drawn back to the dithering figure of the old woman who was shifting
extremely nervously.
‘An amusing idea, granted.’ Voldemort was looking at Harry appraisingly. He lifted his hand
suddenly and traced his cold white finger along Harry’s scar. The second it touched Harry’s skin, the
pain that had plagued his scar as soon as he had entered the dungeon turned into intensely
overwhelming, skull splitting agony. Harry clenched his jaw in an effort to quell the groans that
escaped him, feeling like his forehead was readying to burst open, and then abruptly, the finger was
gone. He gasped as the pain settled to a throbbing pang.
‘Still hurts you so?’ Voldemort said mockingly.
‘Harry?’ Ron was trying to pull himself up so he could see out of the grate, but was unable to see
where the three of them were standing.
‘SHUT UP RON!’ Harry snapped. His anger and pain had driven him to yell so abruptly, but it was his
fear for Ron’s safety that had urged him to say it. An awful dread started to fill Harry as Voldemort
looked impatiently in the direction of the pit.
‘Oblige Potter, Wormtail.’.
Harry’s heartbeat pounded against his chest so strongly he was certain everyone in the room could
hear it.
‘No!’
The old woman smiled wickedly to her self and moved slowly towards the pit. Harry’s anger had
been flooded by utter terror once again. He turned on Voldemort who was watching him with
sadistic pleasure as Ron’s fingers disappeared from view.
‘NO!’ Harry started struggling violently against his restraints.
- 174 -
'NO...' being all that would come to mind.
‘NO!’ Each more desperate than the last as he continued to throw himself against the iron that held
him. ‘Don't!’ His eyes were beginning to sting with tears. He felt utterly wretched as he continued to
pull with all his strength at his bonds, knowing what was about to happen, knowing he could do
nothing to prevent it.
Voldemort was not smiling anymore, his stony expression unfathomable.
The old woman drew a wand from the front pouch of her floral apron.
‘Please ... please, please don't!' A bitter tear spilled down Harry's face. 'Please...’
She pointed it into the pit.
‘Wormtail.’ Voldemort’s cold voice immediately stopped the woman in her tracks. ‘Do not kill the
boy.’ He said, eyeing Harry.
A flash of red light shot out of Pettigrew’s wand and there was a dull thud, and Harry knew Ron was
lying in heap on the floor of the pit. Alive.
He slackened exhausted against his constraints, sickened by the fact that he had shed a tear in
front of Voldemort. Sickened that he had begged for Ron’s life. Voldemort’s evil voice hissed.
‘You see? I too can be merciful.’ Harry wearily raised his head to meet his gaze. ‘You will
understand soon enough.’ He narrowed his heartless eyes. ‘Yes ... soon enough.’ He lifted his wand,
pointing it directly at Harry who instinctively winced. He felt warmth run through the metal that held
him in place as it glowed briefly, and then summoning Wormtail, he entered the narrow archway,
his billowing black cloak disappearing from sight.
Harry hung from the clamps, feeling utterly drained. He looked up to see Hermione still lying on the
bottom of her cage; glad she had remained unconscious. His scar still seared with heated pain and
his wrists and ankles burned as blood seeped slowly through his clothing, but he barely felt the
throbbing. Suddenly he was so tired.
It was some time later before the now recognizable Pettigrew emerged from the doorway. Harry
found as he watched him approach through heavy eyelids, he couldn’t help but smile. He was still
wearing the drab dress and bright floral apron.
‘Drink this!’ Pettigrew held up the cup he had been carrying with his silver hand and tried to place it
near Harry’s mouth.
Harry turned his head away, his hatred of the man returning.
Pettigrew smiled poisonously. ‘It’ll help you feel better.’
Harry kept his face away from the cup. A struggle ensued as Pettigrew tried to force the drink into
Harry’s mouth, grabbing his head and thrusting the cup to his face, but Harry managed to avoid the
silver hand. Eventually Pettigrew let him go and Harry relaxed, but there was a flash of light and a
searing pain shot through his stomach. Harry slumped forward, barely conscious. His head was
roughly yanked back and freezing cold liquid ran down his throat.
When he next opened his eyes, it was to Ron and Hermione’s quiet voices.
‘We cant apparate, and without our wands, we don’t have a hope’ Ron half whispered.
‘Just keep looking for a way to get it open. If one of us can get out, maybe we can retrieve the
wands if they’re not too far away.’
There was an awful ache coming from the back of Harry’s head, and pain was shooting up his arms
as he tried to support his weight on his feet. There were dried bloodstains on his clothing around his
wrists and ankles from his earlier struggle, and yet though pained by his injuries, he felt oddly
refreshed now he had come to, and his scar no longer burned. He looked up to see Hermione
- 175 -
running her hands around the floor of the cage, and turning on the pit, he could see Ron’s fingers
searchingly inspecting the edges of the grate.
‘It’s no use.’ Harry said. Hermione clawed her way to a standing position to look at him and he
could see Ron trying to pull himself up again. ‘Voldemort set the traps, you wont get through them.’
Hermione’s relief at seeing Harry okay could not be quashed by the news. ‘Harry!’ her eyes were
brimming with tears. ‘We were so worried … you’re alright!’
‘Harry?’ Ron’s more sedate voice came from the pit.
‘Yeah?’ Harry said starting to pull at his bonds again.
‘You alright?’
‘Yeah’
‘Me too … thanks to you.’ Harry stopped struggling as Hermione looked down into the pit at Ron.
‘That’s two I owe you, mate.’ Ron said solemnly.
‘What are you talking about?’ Hermione asked, the colour draining from her face.
‘Nothing. Don’t worry about it.’ Harry said a little impatiently. He knew very well how she would
react to Ron almost being killed and he did not fancy listening to her hysterics.
Harry resumed his seemingly pointless struggle against his bonds, but fresh blood started to seep
from his old wounds making him gasp angrily.
‘Harry don’t, you’re just hurting yourself.’ Hermione was wincing as she watched him. He stopped at
her words, growling in frustration.
‘So it is Voldemort.’ Hermione said fearfully, settling at the bottom of her cage.
‘The old woman in the orphanage was Wormtail using polyjuice potion.’ He said darkly ‘I thought I
could smell something pungent ... he must have had a cauldron of the stuff somewhere.’ Harry
yanked his arms against the bonds in frustration. ‘I should have known that smell was the potion. I
should have recognized it!’
‘The same is true for us Harry, it’s not like we all don’t know what it smells like.’ Hermione said
gravely.
‘No point in beating ourselves up about it now,’ Ron said glumly ‘we have to figure out a way out of
here.’
Harry knew there was no way the three of them were going to get out. They were at the mercy of
the Darkest Wizard of all Time, and without their wands, they had no chance of fighting back. None
at all. They had somehow wound up exactly where Voldemort had wanted.
Harry's thoughts were interrupted by Pettigrew, who had finally changed into his black Death Eater
robes and was heading towards him with another cup in his silver hand. Hermione stood up to
watch as he approached Harry. At the sight of Pettigrew, Harry’s anger bubbled though his vanes.
‘Forget it!’ Harry said savagely. ‘I’m not taking that stuff!’
‘You feel better, don’t you?’ Wormtail tittered, bringing the cup up before him. Harry narrowed his
eyes, his anger raging as he looked at the despicable rodent before him. He wanted to rip the
chains from the walls and throttle this pathetic excuse for a human being.
‘Keep away from me!’ he threatened.
‘Have it your way’ Wormtail said in a sly undertone, and once again Harry was pelted in the chest
with a curse that left him almost unconscious. After the icy liquid was thrown down his throat,
- 176 -
Wormtail left with Hermione and Ron both yelling in the distance.
~*~*~*~*~
‘Potter!’
Harry lifted his head and glared into Wormtail’s eyes menacingly, his strength returning with his
fury at the sight of him. Pettigrew took a couple of steps back warily.
‘What’s the matter?’ Harry asked darkly. ‘Afraid of a bound and wandless wizard?’ Harry had never
felt such hatred as he had for this creature before him. His whole body ached with it.
Pettigrew was holding another cup. Harry eyed it knowingly. It was giving him strength, it did make
him feel better and he had wasted precious time resisting it.
‘Give it to me.’
Pettigrew frowned and with nervous, jerky movements, he came closer, pulling his wand out as he
did so.
Harry let out a low laugh. ‘You should be afraid of me.’ Wave after wave of anger and distaste
flowed through him. ‘When I am free, you will be the first one I come for.’
Pettigrew feared Harry, he could see it, and it pleased him. The rat backed away speedily after
administering the icy liquid, leaving the room in a hurried shuffle.
‘Harry?’ Hermione was looking down. He tilted his head back and looked at her, his rage still rippling
through him. ‘Are you feeling okay?’
Most of the pain had abated from him hanging by his wrists because he had been there so long,
they were numb; it was more of a dull ache, though now he was awake and taking the pressure
back on his feet, an unpleasant pins and needles sensation was starting to creep up his arms.
‘Fine.’ He said shortly. ‘How long have we been here?’ He asked, letting his head drop back on the
cold stone, his neck aching from being hung forward for so long.
‘I don’t know … days I would think.’ She frowned at him ‘Harry, don’t take the potion. It’s-’
‘Have either of you had water?’ Harry interrupted.
‘No. Ron was asking for water in his sleep just now.’ She rested her cheek against the cold metal
bars. ‘We’re not going to get out of this, are we?’ She asked almost reluctantly, sounding defeated.
Harry would not lie to save her feelings. Something was slowly changing in him.
‘No ... we’re not.’
In the quiet that followed, he could hear Hermione’s stifled sobs, which flared his anger. Crying
about it wouldn’t help! His scar bagan to sting again and unable to control himself, he started
pulling against his chains with all his might, ignoring the pain in his fury at being caged. The chains
rattled and clanged noisily and he could vaguely hear both Ron and Hermione calling him, but he
was lost in his aggressive struggle, unaware of anything, or anyone else in the dungeon, until two
red beams of light shot out in quick succession, silencing the voices immediately.
Harry stopped suddenly, panting from his efforts and blinking through his sweat at the figure
standing in the middle of the room. His scar was hot with pain and the new lacerations burned
under the metal. He felt his overwhelming anger ebb as an involuntary shudder ran down his spine.
There was something incredibly creepy about Voldemorts expression as he approached Harry.
‘You’re anger and hatred will be quenched soon enough.’ He said darkly. ‘You shall have your wish,
- 177 -
when you are ready.’ Harry’s great hatred was reflected in Voldemorts poisonous eyes, and the
realization disturbed him. He was being consumed by his anger. He could feel it eating away at him,
overtaking him.
‘Wormtail will no longer suffice as your only minder. It is time to send for another.’ Voldemort
seemed to find something amusing; a wicked smile edged across his bloodless lips as he turned
from Harry.
‘Water…’ Harry croaked, weak now he had stopped struggling. ‘They need water.’ All of the
invigorating strength that had possessed him moments ago was gone.
‘But of course.’ Voldemort stopped with his back still on Harry. ‘I can be generous, as well as
merciful.’ He left without looking back, leaving Harry feeling grateful to his captor.
~*~*~*~*~
It wasn’t long before Wormtail brought in two cups. Harry watched him, despising him, hating him
more with every slimy movement the rodent made. He went to Ron then Hermione respectively,
enervating them back to consciousness. He then levitated the cups to each of them before turning
to Harry with his face turned down, unwilling to meet his eye.
‘You will have to wait until your potion is due.’
Harry yanked his arms threateningly against the chains and Wormtail seemed to jolt nervously at
the sound of it before shuffling out of the room.
‘What about you?’ Hermione said. She was looking pallid and sickly as she stared down at Harry.
‘I don’t need it.’ He said harshly.
And he didn’t. No thirst, no hunger, and little pain considering the black and purple bruising around
his slashed wrists. His ankles must have looked the same, though his shredded and bloodstained
boots hid what lay beneath.
After they drank their water, Hermione took her turn to sleep, and after waiting for the sound of her
steady breathing, Ron expressed his concern about her dwindling condition. But Harry could offer
him little comfort in the end. He was starting to fade, the exhaustion had been slowly sweeping over
him since Voldemort had left, and he was losing the battle to stay conscious. His head had dropped
forward again, and the pressure was lifting from his feet as he sunk further down the wall, his arms
and shoulders paining under his weight. Then he passed into darkness once more.
‘So … the Dark Lord finally has his prize.’
A horrible rasping voice brought Harry out of his darkness. As he slowly came round, Harry became
aware of a stench, a smell he remembered lingeringly at first, then as his mind sharpened, he
remembered well. Lifting his head, he opened his eyes in disgust. Fenrir Greyback was standing
before him, smiling viciously. The repulsive smell of body odour, sweat and dirt accosted Harry’s
senses. The hood was down on his filthy cloak, making Fenrir’s dirty matted grey hair visible, and
his pointed teeth showed menacingly as he disgustingly ran his tongue around them.
‘Shame he wants you alive … for now. A taste of the flesh of the “Chosen One” would be sweet
indeed!’ He then licked his lips repulsively, and Harry felt himself sicken. ‘I could take just enough
to leave you alive.’ His eyes lit up and his yellowed, claw-like fingernails tapped his thumb as if he
were readying to pick a delicate morsel of food.
‘Yes’ he hissed, his eyes widening as if he were convincing himself of the idea. ‘You would still be
his, if not wholly.’ He let out a barking laugh that made Harry wince. ‘Wholly’ he laughed again
‘Holey … Get it?’ He seemed to be amusing himself but his vulgar humour made Harry’s stomach
churn.
- 178 -
‘The Dark Lord himself instructed you not to touch him.’ Pettigrew was hovering by the archway.
The instant Harry saw him his hatred began to surface again.
Greyback grunted as he turned to Wormtail.
‘I’ll have my chance one day ... when he is finished with him.’ He started away from Harry, and as
he passed Pettigrew and disappeared, Wormtail eyed him with distaste.
Harry let out a harsh laugh.
‘You think you’re better than him?’ Harry bit out. The sickening repulsion he had felt when Greyback
had been in the room was fast being eclipsed by the unadulterated hatred that Harry seethed with
the moment Pettigrew was in his sights. ‘You judge him after what you did?’ Pettigrew approached
Harry warily.
‘You don't know everything … you also judge-’
‘I know enough.’ Harry cut in loathingly. ‘You betrayed your best friends! My mother and father died
because of you.’ Wormtail swallowed nervously.
‘There was a time you had the chance to kill me, and you didn’t.’ his voice was quivering now.
‘I WAS WRONG!’ Harry roared, throwing himself forward suddenly and making Pettigrew step back.
‘Harry!’ A girlish voice pleaded from above.
‘Give-me-the-chance-again-and-you-would-not-walk-away.’ He said through gritted teeth. Pettigrew
looked far more disturbed than he should. These threats were coming from an imprisoned person
and yet it seemed he truly feared Harry. Harry started yanking at his chains again out of frustration
as Pettigrew made a hasty exit.
‘Harry, don’t!’ The girl said weakly from her cage, he looked up at her and found it repugnant that
she had tears streaming down her face.
‘Hermione?’ The pit voice said. ‘Hermione, are you alright?’
‘No...’ The girl said. Her voice was tired and croaky as she slackened against the cage. ‘I’m sick to
the stomach.' she said weakly. 'Harry, whatever that potion is, it’s changing you, and you have to
fight it. You have to see what its doing to you…’ her voice was becoming faint. Harry turned his
head from her impatiently. He did not understand what she wanted of him.
‘It keeps me upright and you want me to fight it? It might be my only hope of getting out of here.’
He said tonelessly.
‘No Harry.’ Her voice sounded dull and hopeless.
‘Hermione?’ Came from the pit urgently.
‘It is a way out.,’ She continued wearily, as if almost asleep. ‘But not the right one.’ Harry looked up
to see the girl’s eyelids droop heavily. ‘Don’t lose... what makes you different... from him ... Harry…’
Her eyes closed and her face slid down the bars.
‘Hermione!’ The voice from the pit kept yelling urgently, but the girl did not move. Harry stared at
her blankly, unable to feel, to care. Yet something niggled at him annoyingly. He searched the floor
lazily in front of him for what it was that was trying to fight it’s way through to him.
He looked back at the girl in her dangling cage, listening to the other boy’s calls getting more and
more urgent. But he felt numb.
After a while, he realized the boy had been calling his name for some time.
- 179 -
‘HARRY!’ he sounded hurt and angry. ‘WHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS HAPPENING TO YOU?’
He didn’t answer.
‘HARRY! ANSWER ME!’ The boy’s calls went unheeded as Harry stared out in front of him blankly.
It was a long time before the boy finally stopped trying to rouse the girl or get Harry to answer him.
He pounded on the stone walls of the pit before eventually falling quiet. Harry must have dropped
off because he found himself awoken by Wormtail pushing his head up with his silver hand. Fenrir
was standing not too far behind.
As Wormtail pushed the cup to his lips and started tipping it down, Harry recognized immediately
that the warm liquid was not the same potion he had been taking. He tried to thrust his head away,
but the silver hand that gripped his face and held his jaw open, could not be moved. He choked
down the liquid and was about to start viciously accusing Pettigrew of trying to poison him, when he
felt a scorching heat in his rib cage. The pain from it overwhelmed him and he collapsed into
darkness.
When Harry came to sometime later, it was not as before. He was weary, not the least rejuvenated
by whatever it was Wormtail had given him, and the pain... He eased his weight onto his feet again
and let out an involuntary groan as his neck and shoulders seared with burning heat.
‘Harry?’ The boy called from the pit. Harry glanced at it to see fingers poking through the grate, but
he did not answer. He was tired, and angry; so angry that Wormtail had not given him what he
needed, what he sought, what he craved. He did not have the strength to struggle with his bonds so
he stared blankly in front of him, waiting.
‘Harry, what’s going on with you?’ The boy continued to talk in a quiet tone. ‘Hermione hasn’t
woken for hours, and you act like you don’t care.’ The voice from the pit seemed to drone on slowly,
and quietly. ‘Hermione was right. You need to stop taking what ever it is they’re giving you. It's
changing you. You need to remember why we’re here in the first place.’
Cold silence reined.
‘What you did to Ginny was bad enough,’ It continued more angrily. Harry turned his eyes on the pit
as the fingers disappeared. ‘But this just might be unforgivable.’
Something in that name the boy mentioned stirred Harry. A pang shot through him, though it was
something he did not recognize. Curious, he hung quietly for the longest time, trying to picture her.
‘Ginny.’ He breathed quietly as he stared at the stone floor. What was it that distantly taunted him
in that name?
‘What? What did you say?’ came the suddenly urgent request from the previously deadened voice in
the pit. But Harry was tired, so very tired. He closed his eyes and let the pain wash over him.
~*~*~*~*~
When next he woke it was to the feel of Wormtail’s silver hand on his jaw again. He did not have
the strength to fight; it was a struggle to stay conscious enough to drink. He vaguely heard
Wormtail griping nervously to himself about the Dark Lord coming as the cold liquid seeped through
Harry, before he let Harry’s head sag onto his chest and scurried away again.
After a time, the pain that raked through him started to ease, and before long he could feel enough
relief to take the weight on his feet again. His strength returning, he looked around him.
There were no familiar fingers coming from the pit, and looking up to the cage that he had not
thought to check last time he was conscious he could see damp hair flowing out through the bottom
of the bars.
- 180 -
Something still niggled at him, but whatever it was, proved unreachable; he felt detached; numb.
When Wormtail appeared Harry eyed him under his brow threateningly, but all Pettigrew did was
look at Harry, as if inspecting him. He seemed apprehensive as he watched Harry’s determined
stare.
‘You still want to kill me, don’t you?’
‘Let me down and find out.’ Harry said darkly. Pettigrew dithered pathetically.
‘We shall see. Fenrir will be returning shortly.’ He pointed his grubby, claw-like fingernail at Harry.
‘He’s the one you should be worried about.’
‘He’s not the one who owes me.’
When Greyback returned he made his way into the dungeon the same way Harry and the others
had come. As he passed Harry, his eyes widened in delight and he licked his teeth obscenely at him,
repulsing Harry. Amused by the effect he had on Harry, Greyback barked a gloating laugh before
retreating through the arch out of sight.
As Harry hung in the quiet, he bided his time dreaming up ways he could dispose of both Pettigrew
and Greyback when he got free. Alone and in the silence he waited, occasionally flicking a glance at
the pit or the cage, wondering why they interested him so. He half-hung, half-stood there for many
hours. Eventually his eyelids started drooping from boredom more than anything else, and just as
he was sliding down the wall; his eyes closing for the last time, a familiar feeling swamped him. He
lifted his head and snapped his eyes open.
Staring back at him were two chilling red slits.
Harry yanked himself up on his feet, the Dark Lord scanning him suspiciously, lingering on his
wounds. Harry had the uncomfortable feeling he was watched for a while before approached. His
heartbeat raced as the red eyes narrowed.
The Dark Lord then turned from Harry and walked very slowly and deliberately to the pit. Harry
watched in confusion, his eyes dropping to the floor and back again to the black cloaked figure as
an unknowable ache ran through him.
The Dark Lord stopped easily on the edge of the grate and smoothly drew his wand, aiming it in the
pit.
‘Don’t.’ Escaped Harry’s lips quietly. Nervously. Uncertainly. As if he had no idea why he had said it.
The Dark Lord turned his head to look at Harry but did not lower his wand.
‘Why?’ He asked silkily.
Harry was sweating; he could feel it running down his face as his eyes darted everywhere but at his
captor.
‘I-I d-don’t know, I …’
‘Wormtail!’ the command went out icily. Pettigrew entered through the door in a half bow, his
fingers fidgeting nervously.
‘Yes master?’ his quivering voice asked.
The Dark Lord had lowered his wand and was heading back towards Harry.
Harry, fearing the consequences of his actions, avoided the red eyes, and instead focused on the
pathetic, hateful rodent that trailed behind his master.
‘I am losing patience.’ The Dark Lord sounded gravely displeased. His tone was enough to cause a
- 181 -
wave of dread to envelop Harry. ‘Concentrate the last dose.’
‘Yes, my Lord!’
‘And get the other two on their feet ... They will be the ultimate test.’ Whatever this meant, Harry
could tell it almost soothed the Dark Lords anger. Wormtail squirmed and wriggled away quickly,
Harry’s loathsome, penetrating gaze following after him.
The Dark Lord studied Harry, frowning. ‘I will return tomorrow.’ He said to himself. Harry shifted
uncomfortably under his gaze, strangely aware that his scar no longer bothered him in The Dark
Lords presence. The black cloaked figure turned from Harry wearing an evil smile on his thin,
washed out lips. ‘You shall start with something easy.’ he said as he walked away. ‘…Wormtail … I
think.’ A slow, evil laugh came from him as he disappeared through the archway.
Harry was left staring after him in relief, glad The Dark Lord had not punished him in his
displeasure.
Shortly after, Greyback and Wormtail entered the room. Fenrir stood eyeing Harry as Pettigrew
administered potions to the other two occupants of the dungeon. As the two prisoners slowly
started to revive, Wormtail approached Harry with a cup. Harry did not move, he did not fight; he
knew without it, his body would give in. He gulped the freezing liquid and waited for its effects.
Once their jailors left, Harry, who was beginning to feel very tired, having not slept in he didn’t
know how long, let his eyes close. But as he was drifting off, voices interrupted him.
‘Hermione? … Hermione?’ came the voice from the pit.
‘I’m okay.’
‘What about Harry? Can you see him?’ There was a creaking of metal followed by the caged voice
again.
‘I can see him, but he looks like he’s passed out again.’ The voice was wobbly as it added ‘At least, I
hope that’s all it is.’
‘I don’t know that he deserves you worrying over him.’ The pit voice said gravely ‘He wasn’t too
worried about you.’
‘It’s that potion!’ the caged voice sobbed in between words as it spoke. ‘Its not Harry!’
'I don’t think Harry even exists anymore.’ The pit voice said quietly. ‘I think we’ve lost him,
Hermione.’
‘Don’t say that!’ The caged voice said desperately. ‘There must be some way we can reach him!
There must be…’ it trailed off desperately.
They both seemed to go quiet, and Harry finally felt himself edging into darkness.
‘Maybe there is a way.’ The pit voice said slowly, ‘I mentioned Ginny earlier, and I think he was
about to say something but he passed out again…’
At the sound of her name, her image flashed before him, and Harry opened his eyes.
‘Ginny?’ the girls voice said. ‘Of course! Harry! Harry! Are you awake? Harry!’
Harry ignored the calls, though something was stirring inside him uncomfortably.
‘Harry! Wake up!’ The girls voice was getting more determined.
‘Harry! HARRY!’ came from the pit. 'Snap out of it!’
He listened, but did not act.
- 182 -
‘It’s not working … maybe he isn’t just sleeping…’ the girls voice began to sob again. There was no
answer from the pit. ‘Oh Ron … what if none of us make it? Our parents, your family…’ the girl
seemed highly distressed.
‘We’ll make it.’ The boy said gravely. ‘Somehow, we’ll get out of here.’
‘Imagine … imagine when they t-tell Ginny…’
The uncomfortable feeling in Harry’s chest surged at the mention of her name again.
‘She’s going to lose all of us at once! Her brother ... I've known her so long now, we’re like sisters!
We’ve always been so close because of Harry. Ginny never used to shut up about him!’ her sobs
we’re almost a laugh.
A frown was slowly creasing across Harry’s brow as he listened.
‘I thought it was a bit of an obsession at first. I told her to g-get on with her life ... n-n-not to wait
for him to notice her. But she never cared for anyone the way she c-cares for Harry.'
Harry could not move as he listened. An ache was swelling painfully where there had been only
emptiness.
'A-and when I saw them together last year, I knew she m-meant it. She did love him ... even after
J-Julie' the girl's voice kept stumbling on hurriedly. 'She was so hurt ... but she said that if-if it
made him happy, she would let go. Ron ... you should know ... she-she told me she only wanted
him to be hap-happy. She said she’d go on loving him no-no matter what happened.’ she rambled
on.
The pain swelled rapidly in Harry and he began to feel sick.
‘That’s the kind of lo-love you’d give everything for! Re-real love. I don't think he understood ... I
don’t think he ever kn-knew…’ she trailed off as she wept.
It was like someone reached in and took a hold of Harry’s heart, shattering the ice off it. Almost like
it hadn’t been beating until now. With a rushing intake of breath, painful tears swelled in his eyes as
he thought of Ginny. How they had parted. What he had done to her. How she would remember
him. It was as though his soul was thawing, and everything that had slowly drifted away came
flooding back to him.
Harry was raising his head to talk to Ron and Hermione, when several loud noises seemed to come
through the door to the cavern. It was the unmistakable sound of curses hitting solid rock.
21. The Wolf and the Rat and the Cup
Two Death Eaters appeared at the door to the cavern as Pettigrew darted out from the opposite
archway.
‘What’s happening? What are you doing in here? You were ordered not to enter under-.’ But one of
the cloaked figures cut Wormtail off.
‘We’re under attack! We had no choice!’
Harry’s insides sparked as he eyed Pettigrew, his hatred seething, but on hearing the voice from the
lumpy looking Death Eater, his stomach dropped. The voice was that of Amycus, one of the
infiltrators that had stood upon the tower the night Dumbledore was killed.
‘Not so brave when it’s not a sick old man outnumbered by half a dozen murderers, are you?’ The
two Death Eaters turned, seeing Harry hanging there for the first time as he spoke.
‘You?’ A woman’s voice that almost certainly belonged to the other’s sister, Alecto, hissed in
surprise. They both seemed unable to stop staring at Harry as another small explosion came from
- 183 -
the cavern behind them.
‘So this is the secret the Dark Lord has us guarding!’ Amycus leered at Harry with narrowed eyes.
Harry was so tired he was slouched against the wall having trouble keeping his head up as he stared
back at Amycus through heavy eyelids.
‘You’re obviously not one of his most trusted servants if he hasn’t told you then.’ Said Harry,
enjoying the venomous look he received for his trouble.
‘What’s happening? Who’s out there?’ Wormtail’s eyes were wide as he dithered in the archway
nervously.
‘There is a group of them, came through the doors already firing. They wont be able to find their
way down here though. I wiped the track behind us.’ He answered.
Harry watched Wormtail as he scurried to the cavern entrance to look through the doorway.
‘They’re coming!’ he squealed with a look of utter terror on his face as he turned back into the
room.
BOOM!
Another explosion, louder this time, rang through the metal that held Harry to the wall. Alecto took
up position behind the equipment that littered the dungeon, waiting. Amycus moved to the entrance
of the cavern, trying to flatten himself to the wall, ready to take out anyone that came through in
the back.
Harry started laughing lazily, as if half asleep, as he hung from his chains. They turned their heads
to him, staring at him as if they eyed a madman.
‘I’d rather be hanging here than be in your shoes right now.’ Harry said as he eyed them with a
vengeful grin.
‘Shudup!’ Amycus said angrily.
‘If you’re lucky, they’ll kill you quickly…’ Harry added. He was getting an immense satisfaction from
watching them squirm.
‘I’m warning you…’ The stocky Death Eater threatened, eyeing him from under his brow.
‘You have good reason to be scared.’ Harry taunted. ‘You better hope they get to you before I-.’
‘SHUT UP!’ in the time it had taken Amycus to walk a few paces from the wall towards Harry, two
figures poured in through the narrow entrance.
Beams of light of all colours were darting through the air in front of him, but Harry had eye’s for
only one person as he watched Wormtail retreat through the archway, leaving the others to battle it
out. He started tugging at his bonds in angry frustration, his hatred gathering his strength in his
desperate need to pursue his parent’s betrayer.
The voices that had been silent until now rang out again. Hermione screamed suddenly as a curse
slammed into her cage.
‘HERMIONE!’ Ron shouted from the pit.
Harry struggled desperately with the metal clamps, furious to get to Pettigrew. Then all of a sudden,
he was enveloped in gold light and his bonds dropped away from him.
He slumped to the ground momentarily, unused to the weight of his limbs again, but recovered
quickly as he stumbled toward the archway, not bothering to stop and see who it was that released
him.
He entered a long tunnel-like hallway that stretched out in opposite directions. Which way? He
thought impatiently. He turned to the right, and hobbling down the tunnel with all the strength he
could muster, nursing his wounded wrists, he edged carefully into the first opening he came to.
It looked like a makeshift kitchen. Two cauldrons sat atop a pile of burned wood, one much larger
than the other. There was a bench top and some cutlery lying around, and cups like that which
Pettigrew had been forcing liquids down Harry’s throat, but no Pettigrew.
Harry ducked back into the tunnel, limping as fast as he could, the sound of fighting growing ever
- 184 -
more distant, slowing as he rounded the next doorway. The room he was standing in was
completely black.
Lumos! He thought automatically as he brushed the sweat out of his eyes in annoyance. A sudden
white glow fanned out from the gaps in a nearby cabinet. Harry yanked it open, and there on the
shelf was his wand, the end obediently alight. Lying next to it were two others, but Harry reached
only for his, holding it up to scan the room. It appeared to be Wormtail and Fenrir’s sleeping
quarters. A rusty old iron spring bed was in the corner, and a mattress on the floor near where he
was standing, both laden with crumpled up bedclothes, but still no Pettigrew.
He extinguished his wand as he made his way to the last doorway off this end of the tunnel, vaguely
registering noises some distance at his back, but he had no interest in what he had left behind. With
almost feverish anguish at the thoughts of Pettigrew escaping him again, he lunged through the
narrow gap and directed his wand at the only thing that moved.
Pettigrew stopped suddenly at the sight of Harry, a look of sheer terror crossing his face as his
mouth gaped open. He was standing near a small platform in a room that had gold markings etched
on the floor.
‘How did y … w-what are you … ‘ Pettigrew stumbled as he stood, seemingly frozen to the spot.
Harry knew he must have worn a look of unadulterated hatred on his face, because it flowed
through his veins like ice. He approached Pettigrew slowly, his chest heaving as he breathed in his
disgust for the creature hunched before him. He stopped a few feet short of Pettigrew, his face
twisted with the thoughts of revenge, as he watched the treacherous rat squirm.
‘You can’t kill me’ it warbled as it twisted it’s hands together. ‘You’re Harry Potter…’ the voice
strained in desperation. Harry narrowed his eyes and aimed the wand at Pettigrew’s heart.
‘I-I-I changed the potion…’ it said. ‘Y-You c-c-can’t do it. You shouldn’t be able to … I-I-it’s been
almost two days … enough time…’ it blabbered on, wide-eyed and full of fear. Harry took step
forward. He wanted this cretinous thing dead. He wanted it to pay for what it had done. It didn’t
deserve to live. His eye’s blazed as the creature huddled into itself, not able to meet Harry’s burning
gaze. With the wand honed in on Pettigrew, Harry gritted his teeth.
The only sound that filled the chamber was Wormtail’s pitiful sobs as the two of them stayed like
that. Harry’s wand was shaking as he stared down it hatefully.
Why was he hesitating? Why didn’t he do it?
‘You don’t want to kill me…’ it said as it dropped to its knees. ‘You chose not to before!’ It started to
creep towards Harry as it clasped it hands together in front of its face. ‘Please … p-please spare me
… pity me! Please…’ It wailed.
A surge of repulsion and pity began to rise in Harry. He took a step back so Pettigrew could not
touch him as he groped for Harry in his effort to appeal to him. Harry swallowed hard.
The ice in his veins was slowly melting at the realization of what he had been about to do. He
lowered his wand hesitantly, lost in a furious internal battle. Pettigrew seemed to take solace in
Harry’s actions, almost immediately noticing his lack of conviction and his pity.
‘That’s right…’ he whimpered hopefully. ‘You don’t want to kill me … you cant-’
WHAM!
Suddenly Harry was lying on his back sprawled across the floor, his wand had been flung from his
hand and was rolling towards the wall. A heavy weight was on his chest and a putrid smell filled his
senses.
‘You’re mine now!’ Greyback whispered hoarsely on top of him, sniggering evilly and baring his
yellow pointed teeth at Harry.
‘How did you get out?’ Pettigrew sounded alarmed.
‘Dear Alecto opened the cage.’ He sounded pained to talk and his face seemed to be undulating,
- 185 -
stopping Harry from struggling as he watched, too terrified to move. Greyback’s mouth and nose
were distorting as he half laughed, half growled in pain. His eyes rolled back in his head, but then
came back down to Harry again glowing bloodshot and beastly. His face was becoming more
elongated, and Harry felt jagged claws stabbing into his flesh where Greyback’s hands were.
Panic struck through Harry as he realized he was about to have a fully transformed werewolf on top
of him. He began to struggle again, thrashing around madly and finally starting to edge free as he
inched backwards, Greyback's claws tearing through his clothes and raking down his skin as he
went.
With his legs still pinned under the beast, Harry twisted on his stomach and desperately tried to pull
himself free. Then all of a sudden the weight was lifted and he scrambled awkwardly to his feet,
stumbling forward in exhaustion as he went.
He collided with the wall and slumped his cheek against it with his eyes closed, panting, the effort of
freeing himself from Greyback robbing him of the little energy he had left. Slowly he became aware
of the hairs on the back of is neck prickling uncomfortably and another panting breath other than
his own.
He opened his eyes and using the wall for support he turned, dreading what he knew was coming.
His eyes followed the trail of his own smeared blood along the floor as a threatening low, animalistic
growl sounded. The breath left him as he met the werewolf’s hungry gaze.
It slunk towards him, barring its teeth, its tongue lapping at the drool that leaked out of the side of
its mouth.
Any moment it would attack, any moment Harry’s life would change forever - if he lived.
The creature was within reach, its manky breath wafting over Harry’s face, eyeing him viciously
when without warning, it lurched forward. Harry closed his eyes as if shutting them would somehow
shut out what was about to happen. There was a high, painful squeal and Harry waited for the
excruciating feel of its teeth to register, before realizing it wasn’t him that had yelled.
Opening his eyes wide, the werewolf was only inches from his face, but it seemed frozen as its
mouth gaped open. It dropped back slowly and as it did Harry could see something strange poking
through its chest. A pitiful dog-like whine escaped its mouth as the thing that was in its chest
retracted. The werewolf collapsed to the ground, gargling as if drowning in its own blood then it
breathed no more.
Harry look up in astonishment at Pettigrew, who was standing with his blood covered sliver hand
held out in front of him, looking down at Greyback.
He shuddered and looked at Harry before turning speedily and scurrying to the exit. A figure
appeared in the doorway, and a wand was raised on Pettigrew.
‘NO!’ Harry yelled. Tonks hesitated as she took in the sight before her, keeping her wand on
Pettigrew as he turned nervously to her.
‘Let him go.’ Harry said as he wrenched himself off the wall behind him. Pettigrew glanced back at
Harry, and then down to Greyback almost as if he couldn’t believe it himself, before looking at
Tonks again.
‘Tonks.’ Harry said as he stepped forward. ‘Let him go.’ She moved inside the doorway, allowing
Pettigrew to pass. He skulked passed her, her wand still trained on him.
Once he was clearly gone Tonks moved quickly to an unsteady Harry, throwing his arm over her
shoulder.
‘Did it bite you?’ She asked as they headed for the door. He didn’t hear her at first, still lost in his
turbulent feelings. The hatred that had flared in him for so long had been temporarily doused, but
he still struggled with believing what had just happened.
‘Harry! Hey!’ Her concern roused him and he looked at her questioningly. ‘Did it bite you?’ Harry
shook his head.
‘No. No, it didn’t get the chance.’ Harry stopped. ‘My wand.’ He said, looking to the other side of the
- 186 -
room. Tonks pointed her wand at it and it flew at them and Harry grabbed it with his free hand.
‘Harry!’ Ron came rushing through the door and skidded to a halt on the marble flooring. Harry
jolted at the site of him. He was filthy, coated in dirt from his stay in the pit and looking extremely
tired.
‘You look how I feel.’ Harry said with a wry smile. Ron was running his eyes up and down Harry,
taking in all the blood and bruising. He swore.
‘Hermione said you were in bad shape, but…’ he paused as he followed the trail of blood, his eyes
falling on the werewolf. He swore again. He looked up suddenly urgent ‘It didn’t bi-’
‘No.’ Harry interrupted ‘It didn’t.’ A look of relief came over Ron’s face, and then it seemed to cloud
over as he watched Tonks ease Harry down onto one of the three black marble stumps that lined
the room.
‘I’m back Ron.’ Harry said, reading Ron’s expression. ‘It’s worn off.’
‘It has, has it?’ He replied soberly.
‘Yes.’ Harry said as Tonks peeled open several layers of his ripped and ragged clothing, frowning at
the bruising and lacerations on his wrists and arms.
‘Then why haven’t you asked if Hermione’s alright?’
Harry stared at Ron who was still eyeing him distantly.
‘I-I … w-w…’ He trailed off. Tonks lifted his t-shirt to see where all the blood was coming from.
Harry looked down at the deep gashes from where Greyback’s claws had imbedded themselves in
his skin and torn down his back and side. It was her turn to swear as her eyes pooled with tears.
Ron paled visibly beneath the dirt smeared all over his face. Harry looked away ashamed. Ron was
right, he hadn’t bothered to ask after Hermione, not only that, but he had run after Pettigrew in his
quest for revenge, and not even stopped to see if they were freed safely.
‘This is beyond my skills in healing.’ Tonks said as she summoned some bandages that coiled
around Harry’s chest and waist. ‘We have to get you out of here.’ She said lowering his clothing.
Just then, Hermione appeared in the doorway. She looked pale and drawn, and her hair was damp
with sweat as she moved to stand beside Ron.
‘You’re alright?’ she asked Harry quietly.
‘I’m fine.’ He said avoiding her gaze; suddenly aware he didn’t deserve her concern. He opened his
mouth to say what he knew he should have days ago, though he couldn’t seem to get the words
out.
‘Me too.’ Hermione said pityingly, seeming to understand more than he did. She stepped away from
them and looked around the room, her eyes falling on the body first. Her voice squeaked as she
asked ‘Did it-’
‘No.’ Ron answered.
Tonks was helping Harry back on with his jacket and easing him off the marble pillar when
Hermione’s voice made them all turn to look at her.
‘Harry, this is it!’ she was saying as she traced her hand along the markings on the floor. Harry
frowned and for the first time, looked about the room. He took in the platform in the centre and the
golden runes that were splayed around it on the floor and the three pillars. He let go of Tonks and
limped towards Hermione.
‘It’s here?’ He asked. She looked up at him nodding.
‘I think so.’
Ron came up behind him. ‘What does it all mean?’ he asked.
‘I don’t think we should be hanging around here any longer than we have to.’ Tonks said, eyeing
them with frowned curiosity.
‘There’s something we have to do before we go.’ Harry turned to her with a determined look. ‘I’ll
explain later. We wont be long.’
'What?’ she asked cautiously.
‘Not right now, we don’t have time!’ Harry said warningly. ‘Please, just give us a minute.’
‘Alright,’ she hesitated as she frowned at him. ‘I’ll go back and see how Moody’s getting on with his
- 187 -
two new friends, make sure no one else is coming.’ She moved off reluctantly. When she was gone,
Hermione continued.
‘It’s a rune triangle.’ She said as she shook her head.
‘What … like the one we did at Halloween?’ Ron asked sceptically.
‘Well … yes … and no.’ she said as she wove her way around the symbols. ‘It’s the same sort of
magic, though this … is a magical key, I suppose you might call it.’
‘How do we open it?’ Harry asked.
‘Opening it isn’t the problem,’ she looked up at them warily ‘It tells you how, and that is the
problem.’
‘What d'ya mean?’
‘Well, Voldemort would have constructed this, right?’ she reasoned slowly. ‘He’s not likely to forget
how to get to the cup himself, is he? So why write a set of instructions on how to do it?’ They both
stared at her blankly for a moment, and then Harry caught on.
‘It’s booby trapped.’ He said as he heaved a sigh.
‘It’s like a game to him.’ She nodded again.
‘So how do we open it without setting it off?’ Ron asked
‘You can’t,’ she said ‘it will go off as soon as its opened this way, no matter what.’
‘Voldemort’s sick curiosity again, just like in the cave. His idea of “testing the worth” of whoever
gets this far.’ Harry said grimly.
‘Yes.’ Hermione was growing ever more anxious as she watched Harry. ‘Harry, I don’t think we
should attempt this now. We should come back after I’ve-’
‘you know that’s not an option. It’s now or never.’ Harry cut in abruptly. ‘Tell me what I have to do.’
‘Well, for some reason it’s already been partially opened,’ her fists were clenching as her hands
hung by her sides. ‘Someone has already done most of the work to bring the pillars up.’ She
motioned to the marble columns.
‘Pettigrew!’ Harry said. ‘That’s what he was doing in here, he must have been trying to remove it for
him.’ Harry was already regretting his decision to let Pettigrew go. ‘So what’s left to do?’ Hermione
was frowning as if not sure she wanted to continue.
‘Hermione.’ Harry prompted. ‘What do I have to do?’ She glanced at the three marble pillars.
‘You need to place a few drops of your own blood on each of the columns,’
Blood again, Harry thought. ‘That wont be too hard.’ He said wearily.
She stepped nearer the to the platform ‘Then you have to stand on the triangle, and that’s all it
says.’ But she paled as she pointed to the ceiling directly above it ‘Though I have a feeling that will
come down, whatever it is.’ Harry looked at the triangle shape inserted into the ceiling that looked
like it was made of black glass.
‘What will happen then?’ Ron swallowed nervously as he eyed it.
‘I don’t know.’ She said, her eye’s full of fear and concern as she looked back at Harry.
He walked over to the first pillar and yanked his jacket and jumper off, leaving only his torn and
blood stained t-shirt on. Hermione gasped as he pulled the bandages off, exposing the ripped skin.
Immediately blood dripped from the wounds and Harry put his wand tip to the red drops and caught
some on the end of it. He let it drip onto the pillar and then moved off to do the same with the next
one.
‘Harry, I don’t think you should be doing this now.’ Hermione’s quivering voice said.
‘We’ve already had this conversation.’ He said flatly, as the blood dripped off his wand tip.
He approached the last pillar without looking at her.
‘But I didn’t know how badly you were hurt.’ Her voice was growing stronger with conviction as she
spoke. ‘This is going to test you beyond anything you can imagine Harry, and look at you! You
shouldn’t even be walking around, let alone trying to withstand who knows what!’ He ignored her as
he moved to go to the platform. She planted herself in front of him with a furious look on her face.
‘You’re not doing it! I wont let you!’ She said through her teeth, her wand in hand.
Harry glared back at her for a moment, but he was too tired for an argument. He softened his look
and slumped his shoulders convincingly.
- 188 -
‘You’re right. I’m not in any condition to do this.’ He nodded slightly and saw the look of surprised
relief on her face.
‘W-We’ll come back, as soon as you’re healed.’ She said. ‘Ron, grab his clothes.’ Harry allowed
himself to be turned and walked to the door but ushered her in front of him as Ron walked slowly
towards them holding Harry’s clothes in one hand, bringing up the rear.
Ron stopped at the door, his face grim, eyeing Harry knowingly. Before Hermione knew what was
happening Harry turned back and darted towards the platform. She threw herself after him, but Ron
dropped the clothing and caught hold of her round the waist, restraining her.
‘NO! Harry…’ she sobbed as Harry reached the platform.
Within seconds he was encased in the dark glass as it dropped over him from the ceiling. His feet
left the ground and his hair swirled around his head as he was immersed in liquid. Dark clouds
swelled and grew around him, the blood leaving his wounds and blending with the liquid he was
trapped in.
The blood on the pillars began to bubble as Harry’s hands began to pound frantically against the
glass-like tomb.
~*~*~*~
Harry’s vision was blurred by the icy dark liquid that suspended him, which was so cold it felt like a
thousand little knives stabbing at his skin. He could just make out Ron and Hermione’s figures
moving beyond the glass. A sudden flash of light shot towards him, causing the watery substance
around him to ripple and sending a shockwave through him, but the barrier did not break.
Harry stopped clawing at the glass to pull his own wand free of his jean pocket. Reducto! He
thought. A beam of light cut through the water towards the glass, which was clear behind the
blackish fluid, but died out before it reached its target. He shot off two more in quick succession,
aware his time was running out, but neither of them made it more than a couple of inches through
the liquid, which seemed to smother the beams of light rapidly.
In angry panic, Harry pressed his wand tip to the glass and fired again at point blank range. Bolts of
jagged light stretched out in a web across the glass, the freezing liquid reverberating with the force
of its power making Harry clutch at his ears as the pressure built up within the tomb, but the web of
light died out and the glass remained.
His movements were slowing now, becoming increasingly clumsy as the cold penetrated his body.
He was beginning to feel very tired as the air in his lungs ran out. His wounds were no longer
stinging. His whole body felt numb.
He had slowed to doing nothing as he stared out at the two frantic figures beyond the tomb beneath
heavily hung eyelids, frozen to the bone. Harry’s lungs seemed to be the only part of him that could
feel as they threatened to burst. So this is it? He thought, floating still in the icy black water. His
heartbeat slowed dramatically and his eyes closed. He’s won… Then his heartbeat stopped
altogether.
Everything was quiet. And warm. And peaceful.
A smoky white mist gently wisped around him in the darkness, caressing him, growing slowly as it
flowed and ebbed, seeming to gradually become thicker and take on form. Milky figures at his back
were guiding him gently as he drifted towards a small warm light that glowed in the distance. All of
the pain he had been in was gone, and he felt safe and at peace.
As he neared the light, he realized it had a form. He was almost on top of it before he saw it was a
small golden chalice. The Cup! Harry reached out his arms as he floated before it, grabbing the two
slim, cool metal handles and pulling it to him. Almost immediately he became aware he was still
drifting. He looked up directly ahead of him to see a beautiful red glow that looked faintly familiar.
- 189 -
He could feel himself being sucked gently to it and found he was keen to reach it, when something
made him stop.
‘Sweetheart,’ a hauntingly sweet feminine voice made him turn, his movements slow as if in water.
His mother, Lily, was beckoning him to her with her misty white hand, his father, James, drifting at
her side. Harry’s heart lifted as he started using his arms to swim his way to them, but the pull of
the red light was growing stronger, dragging him backwards.
‘Fight it Harry.’ His fathers deep, comforting voice urged ‘You can do it.’
Harry looked over his shoulder at the light which only a moment ago had seemed so enticing and
watched as it grew in size, gaping open like an enormous sinister mouth, sucking everything to it.
He put all his effort into swimming his way through the thick surroundings away from it and towards
his parents, still grasping the cup firmly in his hand, until finally he started moving away from the
red glow.
‘That’s it Harry, keep coming.’ His father encouraged Harry to kick even harder and pull himself
along faster, but try as he might, they seemed to keep drifting away from him.
‘You’re almost there, darling.’ His mother gave him a broad smile that warmed Harry through. He
was getting nearer to them, and keen to be with them, he sped up as fast as he could.
Glancing over his shoulder the red mouth was gaining on him. He looked back at his mother and
father, and using every ounce of strength in him to reach them, he swam towards them,
concentrating all his effort on being with them, desperate not to let them go, until finally stopping
before them.
‘You are ready for the task given to you, son’ his father said ‘Have faith in yourself, as we do.’
‘Remember Harry, we’re always with you.’ His mother said. They sounded like they was saying
goodbye.
NO! Harry tried to speak but he couldn’t make a sound. A heavy sadness came over him as their
misty bodies flew apart to reveal a small white glowing orb. He reached his free hand out
despairingly and touched it with his finger. It sunk into the light, which began enveloping him,
creeping up his hand and arm gradually, until it encased his whole body.
Coughing and spluttering, pain once again searing through his freezing cold body, Harry opened his
eyes to see Hermione crouched over him. He had the strangest feeling she had just been kissing
him.
She was soaking wet, as were Ron and Mad-eye behind her, but Harry could still see the tears
pouring down her face. As Harry pushed himself up into a sitting position she scooped him into her
arms and hugged him so tightly he thought he might pass out again.
‘Don’t you ever do that to us again!’ she sobbed as she rocked him in her arms.
‘Hermione let him go. You’re going to suffocate him, then you’ll have to do that pash of a lifetime
thing again.’ Ron said seriously. Harry felt two hands grab him under the elbows and lift him to his
feet.
‘It’s called the “kiss of life” Ron.’ Her voice was still wobbling dangerously. Harry saw the marble
floor was covered in the inky water that had encased him mixed with pools of his own blood. He was
shaking uncontrollably, his teeth chattering uncontrollably as Moody threw some clothing over his
back.
‘What’s that?’ he asked gruffly, pointing at Harry’s stomach. Harry looked down at the golden cup
clasped tightly in his hand. He didn’t want to speak, he didn’t want to have to explain right now,
and he was feeling like he might not be able to stand much longer.
‘Let’s get out of here. He looks like he’s not going to last long.’ Hermione said.
‘M-m-my wand’ Harry stammered croakily as he shook.
‘I’ve got it’ Ron said ‘here.’ He slid it into Harry’s back pocket. Moody growled.
‘Now what have I told you lot about storing your wands there?’ He said, helping Harry limp out the
doorway and up the tunnel. ‘Don’t come running to me with only one buttock when it goes off
- 190 -
accidentally!’ Harry tried to stay with them, but blackness was creeping into his vision. His head
spun and little lights sparked before his eyes. Then his body slumped and everything went black.
~*~*~*~
When Harry opened his eyes, he found he was at Julies again, lying in her bed as she snoozed on a
thin mattress by the fireplace. The grey morning light crept through the open curtains as the sun
surfaced, so Harry edged himself up and pulled on his jeans.
His body was still sore, the bruising around his wrists and ankles were all shades of deep purple and
black, but the wounds down his back and sides did not gape as they had done. In fact, they were
sealed neatly together, leaving almost no marks.
Harry walked to the kitchen and put some tea on, his back to the rest of the room. He felt
extraordinarily hungry, so he hunted the cupboards for something to eat, pulling out some bread
and throwing together a cheese sandwich. He took two mugs out and filled them both, and then
walking over to Julie and crouching down next to her, he reached out and tapped her on the
shoulder.
To Harry’s surprise she stirred almost immediately.
‘Here.’ He passed her the tea as she sat up looking at him from heavy eyelids. Her hair was ruffled
and she was still fully clothed. ‘How long have I been here?’ he asked.
‘They brought you in the early hours of yesterday morning.’ She said and took a sip of her tea.
Harry nodded and unconsciously reached out and pushed her hair back from her face.
‘Thank you Julie.’ He said, and then realizing the intimacy of the situation, he pulled his hand back
awkwardly. ‘You really do have a gift for healing.’ He smiled, feeling incredibly grateful yet also
slightly embarrassed.
‘Don’t mention it.’ She flashed a quick smile at him that appeared to Harry to be strained.
‘Is everything okay?’ he asked. This wasn’t the first time he’d picked up that all wasn’t as well with
Julie as she liked to make out.
‘Yes’ she brightened suddenly. ‘It’s you and your friends we were all so worried about. When you
disappeared like that. We’ve been looking for the three of you for a week.’ Harry sighed and stood
up, going back to the kitchen and putting his cup and sandwich on the table before sitting down,
Julie joining him.
‘I’ve got to leave as soon as possible,’ he said almost to himself ‘get back to Hogwarts.’ He bit into
his sandwich. He knew Ron and Hermione would have taken the cup there.
‘Your friends were here yesterday afternoon.’ She said, trying to catch his eye. ‘That girl, Ginny was
with them.’ Harry stopped chewing and looked up. ‘I don’t know why she bothered to come, to be
honest.’ Julie said ‘She didn’t look at all concerned about your state of health. Seemed to spend
most of her time trying to nosy around my flat.’
Harry frowned but didn’t say anything, just resumed eating. When her comment appeared not to
get the reaction she expected, Julie pushed further ‘You know, if you two are in love, she has a
funny way of showing it.’
Harry pushed his chair back and left the table, slipping a clean t-shirt over his head and throwing on
his jacket. ‘I’ll see you round.’ He mumbled and headed for the stairs. Julie stepped in front of him,
handing him a fresh bottle of purple tonic.
‘Take this, and remember, seven drops with water or juice. The state you’re in, you’ll need to keep
taking it until the bottles empty.’
Harry took the bottle, stashing it in his pocket, and then started down the stairs, making it as far as
the door before she called out to him again.
He paused with his hand on the doorknob.
‘Harry’ she said again, more quietly this time.
He finally looked around at her as she reached the bottom of the stairs. ‘You know you can come
- 191 -
here anytime if you need to … I-I-If you want to.’ Harry could see in the bright waiting room the
dark rings under her eyes as they glazed with tears. She held something out for Harry, placing it
lingeringly in his hand when he turned his palm up. It was an ornate golden key, the same one he
had seen her use to unlock the door he was standing before.
‘N-no’ he said uncomfortably as he tried to hand it back to her. She stepped back and waved his
hand away.
‘Keep it. You might find you need it.’ She was frowning as a tear spilled down her face. Harry turned
and opened the door, going through it and closing it behind him, pausing outside it momentarily to
shove the key in the same pocket as his tonic before angrily taking a few steps and then
disapparating to arrive outside the Hogwarts gates.
What is she playing at? He thought, his temper bubbling just below the surface. What does she
want from me? He locked the gates and started walking to the entrance when he veered off and
headed to Hagrids. There was no smoke rising from the chimney, even in this cold weather, so
Harry didn’t hold much hope of finding Hagrid at home, but he knocked briefly and tried the handle
automatically, expecting it to be locked, but it opened easily.
He walked into the gloomy room, all the curtains were closed allowing only minimal light. Harry saw
something stir out of the corner of his eye, and was surprised to see Socks sitting on Hagrids made
bed. He smiled and went to sit down next to her. She was peering at him through her large green
eyes, her tail flicking in annoyance by her paws.
‘What have you got to be so angry about?’ he said as he pulled her to him, entwining his fingers in
her fur. ‘You’ve found yourself a nice place to sleep and still have your freedom to run around
chasing mice at your leisure. Sounds like a pretty good life to me.’ He held her out in front of him,
laughing softly as he looked on the grumpiest cat he’d ever seen. ‘Anyone would think I was
interrupting something. You don’t have a Tom cat hidden in here do you?’ Harry made a mock
search of the room with his eyes and Socks swiped at his face with the paw of a bear for his trouble.
‘Whoa… Touchy little thing aren’t you? Ah, now I get it,’ Harry said quietly ‘your mistress has told
you to treat me like the git I am, hasn’t she?’ He was wearing a wry smile, hiding the real pain at
the thoughts of Ginny’s feelings towards him at the moment.
She had come with Ron and Hermione to see how he was, but according to Julie she didn’t look
interested in his condition at all, seemingly far more interested in Julie. I guess its natural, he
thought. She’s probably too mad at him still to want to show anyone she cares. That must be it, he
thought. He cuddled Socks to his chest, and despite her apparent grumpiness she began purring
loudly.
‘You still love me at least’ He held her up again ‘So what d’ya think, will she ever forgive me?’ The
cat wriggled free and dropped onto his knees. Socks quickly sunk her claws in, and as Harry jumped
up at the prickly pain, she scooted over to the door and disappeared round it. ‘Well I guess that
answers that question.’ Harry left the hut, closing the door behind him, and headed for the
entrance.
There was a lot of clatter coming from the Great Hall and Harry figured it was breakfast, and having
left the majority of his sandwich back at Julies, he entered the hall and stood at the end of what he
thought was the Gryffindor table, ready to sit down, but there was something strange about it.
There were some Gryffindors sitting at it, piling their plates or eating their breakfasts, but there
were also Hufflepuffs Ernie and Justin sitting opposite Dean and Seamus, and to their right was
Luna, which was not so surprising as she had taken it on herself to sit with Ginny at the Gryffindor
table anyway this year, but also Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot, all fellow Ravenclaws sitting
chatting comfortably with Lavender and Ginny.
Ginny … his eyes lingered on her. She was spooning food onto her plate, looking wind swept and
beautiful, as if she’d just gotten off her broom after a rigorous game of Quidditch. Harry tore his
eyes away finally to see Susan and Hannah laughing at something the Creevey brothers had said.
The only one missing who should have been a part of this was Neville. Harry suddenly didn’t feel
like eating anymore and he turned to leave.
- 192 -
‘Oh no you don’t!’ Hermione and Ron had just entered behind him. They still looked worse for wear
after their ordeal, but Hermione was eyeing him determinedly ‘You’re eating, nothing is going to
spoil this.’ She nodded at the table.
‘What’s going on?’
‘The DA mate, they’re growing, booming in fact.’ Ron said as he bounced on his toes. ‘Seems when
we all went missing for so long people were signing up like mad. Ginny was able to give out the
extra coins to keep up, and well, with such a mishmash of houses, they decided it would be better
to eat together so they could keep up with the latest news and maybe help figure out what
happened to us.’
Harry frowned, feeling utterly lost. ‘But how? Why?’ he asked.
‘Neville.’ Hermione said affectionately. Harry turned to look at her. ‘He did a lot of campaigning for
the recruitment of the DA, seems he had a lot more friends than he ever knew. They did it for him
in the end.’
Hermione directed them to three empty places at the end of the table, a little away from everyone
else. Harry received a lot of smiles and nods, even a wave or two from the rest of the table when
they noticed he was there. Things had changed from being the invisible boy.
‘They know Harry.’ Hermione said across the table to him.
‘Know?’ Harry’s stomach dropped.
‘They know Voldemort had us for the past week.’
‘What?’ Harry was stunned. ‘Who told them?’
'McGonagall did yesterday after we got back.’ Ron answered ‘Not in front of us of course, Hermione
and me were up in the Hospital while Madame Pomphrey shoved the most disgusting potions you’ve
ever tasted down our throats.’ He screwed his face up in remembrance.
‘Why did McGonagall do that?’ Harry still couldn’t fathom it.
‘Well it’s the truth,’ Hermione said ‘and I guess she feels people deserve to know what’s going on.
And I agree with her to be perfectly honest.’
Harry thought about it for a minute. He had been so used to keeping everything they did a secret
that it was going to take some getting used to if this sort of thing was going to happen often. To
take his mind off it he filled his plate and started eating, his appetite returning with the first piece of
bacon. During his meal he set about asking how they got him free of the glass tomb.
Apparently they realized pretty quickly that their normal spells weren’t going to work, and after
seeing Harry try and fail, they panicked as they watched him give up and stop trying. ‘I was numb
with the cold. I couldn’t have moved if I wanted to.’ He said impatiently.
It turned out that Ron bolted off to get help while Hermione stayed back and watched Harry die.
Tears were swelling in her eyes as she recounted how horrible it was to watch and yet not be able
to do anything. She said he must have been lifeless for at least 5 minutes before Moody figured out
a way of removing the glass altogether.
It vanished and the water burst out all over them as Harry dropped to the floor. Moody said Harry
was gone and nothing could be done but Hermione wouldn't give up. Her muggle first aid training
had taught her how to do CPR and since Harry had been immersed in freezing cold water, his brain
had a good chance of still being in tact even after almost six minutes without oxygen.
‘Something Voldemort would never have considered.’ Said Hermione nastily. ‘When he made that
trap, he made it for great wizards, which in his mind means pure-bloods, he knew whoever went in
after the cup would have to die to reach it, and that was where he thought it would end, in your
death. He never would have imagined muggles could be so useful.’
‘Once again he underestimated something he despises and doesn’t understand. Muggleborns!’ Ron
said cheerily, putting an arm around Hermione’s back proudly. She smiled sheepishly and leaned
into him.
‘That’s right.’ Hermione said ‘Wizards think once someone is dead then there is no bringing them
- 193 -
back.’ Harry listened and thought about how Voldemort was being slowly defeated by the things he
constantly underestimated. Then he told Ron and Hermione about seeing his mum and dad, how
they had helped him, telling them he never would have gotten back with the cup in the first place
without them.
‘Another loophole he does not understand.’ Hermione said as she pointed her fork at Harry. ‘Once
you cross over, the people who are there and love you can help you.’ Harry shook his head.
‘Where’s the cup?’ he asked suddenly.
‘Safe’ Ron said.
‘We’ll tell you later.’ Hermione motioned to the people nearest them that had started to eaves drop.
When they were noticed they turned guiltily back to their food.
‘P-Professor McGonagall w-would like to see you b-before lunch.’ A small voice came from behind
Harry. He looked over his shoulder and little Peter was standing behind him looking extremely
nervous. Harry smiled at Peter and ruffled his hair affectionately.
‘Thanks, Pete. How are your patronuses coming on?’ he asked, genuinely interested.
Pete shrugged, ‘Okay, I guess.’ but he sounded very down. Harry smiled his best smile.
‘How about I do some one on one with you?’
Peter’s eyes brightened immediately as he nodded.
‘Okay, let me know when you’ve got some free time and we’ll work something out.’ Harry said.
Peter seemed speechless and just nodded before moving away and almost walking straight into
someone coming up the isle.
'Think you’ve got a bit of a groupie there, mate.’ Ron teased.
‘He’s a good kid who deserves a break.’
After they finished breakfast Harry went up to crawl into bed, still feeling the strain of the week’s
events. He took out Julie’s tonic and chided himself. She had told him seven drops in water and last
time he had only been using five; that was why it didn’t seem to be doing the job as well. This time
he measured out seven drops and after returning the lid and placing the bottle, along with Julies
front door key in his bedside cabinet draw, he downed the liquid and laid back on his bed, pulling
the curtains around to shut out the dark, and closed his eyes. He barely had time to think about
what he had to say to the Professor at their meeting before dropping into a deep sleep.
When he woke a couple of hours later it was with a start. Something had come back to him in his
dreams and it disturbed him greatly. He had remembered dreaming about floating between the two
lights weeks ago when he got back to Hogwarts after Halloween. Only then it had been Ginny’s
voice that had drawn him back. Would he have been headed for that same sinister red light that
sucked you in if she hadn’t woken him? The realization sent his head spinning.
When he made his way up to the Headmistresses office, he pondered what she had to say to him.
So often he had walked in there and come out completely confounded, having entirely not expected
what she, or indeed, who ever else was in the office with her, would have to say. Something told
him this time would be no different, especially after recent events. Once outside her doors, he
knocked. They flung inwards at the Professors command. ‘Enter.’
‘You wanted to see me?’ Harry walked slowly towards her, mildly surprised there was not a lynch
mob laying in wait for him.
‘Yes. Sit down, Potter.’ Harry slouched in the chair before her desk and waited as the doors thudded
closed behind him. She was yet to look at him as she busied herself with paperwork, and then upon
standing, she moved around the desk and kept walking until she stood before Dumbledore’s
portrait. Harry did not look at the painting, too angry about what happened last time he was in here
to face the old man. Turning, McGonagall clasped her hands in front of her and peered at Harry
shrewdly.
‘Where is the cup, Harry?’ The Professor’s words were the last thing he expected.
‘What?’ he asked, baffled.
‘The Horcrux, Harry,’ said a familiar, gentle old voice ‘where is it and how do you plan on destroying
it?’ Harry looked up at the painting of Dumbledore and met his old mentors eyes, acutely aware that
every single past Head of the school was now eyeing him with great interest.
- 194 -
22. Friend or Foe?
Though Dumbledore’s face was kindly, Harry still found his anger was brewing uncontrollably inside
him. This man had chosen to ignore him when Harry needed him most, and now that there was
something he wanted from Harry, he was demanding an answer.
Harry did not get up from his chair; instead he turned his gaze to the edge of the desk in front of
him. ‘I don’t know where it is.’ He said sullenly. His answer was met with silence. After an
uncomfortable amount of time, Professor McGonagall spoke.
‘You did obtain the cup, did you not?’
‘Yes.’
‘Then it seems to me, you would know of its whereabouts.’
‘You would think so, wouldn’t you?’ Harry said darkly ‘But maybe you hadn’t heard, I was
unconscious when they took me to Julies, so I have no idea what Ron and Hermione did with it.’
The room erupted.
‘Insolence!’ One of the paintings remarked huffily. ‘No respect!’ Said another. ‘Typically teenage.’
Came the sarcastic drawl of Phinneus Nigellus from the far wall.
‘Harry, I understand how you feel,’ Dumbledore said, quieting the comments. ‘But there-’
‘How I feel?’ Harry cut in. He lifted himself from the chair and walked slowly towards the painting,
glaring at the old man. ‘You understand? That’s what you’ve got to say to me after months of
waiting? You understand how I feel?’ Harry’s fury was surging through him, he could feel it
gathering momentum, threatening to burst.
‘You know what its like to face the darkest wizard of all time, having almost no power of your own,
with the fate of everyone you love riding on your shoulders? You know what its like to see the
people you get close to, one by one die, just because they are close to you? No… Don’t tell me you
understand. Don’t tell me you know what I’m feeling.’ His eyes were beginning to swell with angry
tears.
‘Do you know what I had to do to get that cup? Do you? I died … Can you believe it?’ Harry ignored
Professor McGonagall’s intake of breath as she brought her hand to her mouth. He shook his head in
bafflement, staring at the floor searchingly as if somehow he might find the explanation he was
looking for if he looked at it long enough. ‘I had to die to get it. I mean… Who would think to set a
trap like that? …’ For the first time, the events of the past week started to sink in. Harry’s legs
began to feel like jelly. ‘What sort of person…’
‘The worst kind of person, Harry.’ Dumbledores eyes watered as he looked down on him. ‘And you
are right, I do not know what its like to be you. But I do know you. Well enough to believe you will
find a way to deal with your pain and get on with the task at hand.’ He said ‘You are not alone,
Harry.’
‘YOU LEFT ME!’ Harry roared at the two dimensional image. ‘I AM ALONE!’
‘I had to, Harry.’ A tear crept down Dumbledore’s cheek as he spoke grimly. ‘One day you will come
to understand. For now, you must trust in what you know is right.' Dumbledore straightened in his
chair and his voice strengthened as he continued. 'The time for hiding is over. Voldemort knows
now what you are doing, and he has already set in motion plans to ensure you do not succeed.’
Harry felt like a pallet of bricks had been dropped on him. ‘What?’
‘He has been aware for sometime that three of the Horcruxes are gone, and of course, he will have
discovered you managed to retrieve the cup by now. It must be destroyed as soon as possible, and
your search for the unknown Horcrux should begin.’
‘How do I destroy it?’ Harry asked, forgetting his anger in his need to find an answer.
‘Knowing how to destroy it is not so much a problem as living through it. You have already been on
- 195 -
the receiving end of the lockets curse.’
‘So what do I do?’
‘The same thing you have always done. Your best.’ Dumbledore leaned back in his chair wearily.
McGonagall walked to her desk and leaned on her two hands, peering at Harry. ‘I would suggest you
start looking closer to home for help, Potter.’
‘Home?’ Harry said.
She nodded and raised her eyebrows ‘Hogwarts is the best home some of us have ever known.’
Harry walked to the door, and then turned uncertainly. ‘Professor, how did the Order find us? How
did they know where we were?’ She answered without looking at him; busily sorting paper piles on
her desk. ‘Let’s just say, persistence paid off.’
~*~*~*~
Harry went down to the Great Hall to catch the last of lunch after he left the Heads office, picking up
a pumpkin juice and taking it with him after he had hurried down chips and lasagne. When he finally
caught up with Ron, he was sitting in the common room, sulking. It seemed Zach had been chasing
Hermione down ever since she returned, and she could no longer hold him off with excuses and so
agreed to meet him.
‘What are you so upset about?’ Harry said confused. ‘She’ll call it all off now we have the cup.’
Ron sneered. ‘You haven’t heard then?’
‘Heard what?’ He asked, taking a seat opposite him, sipping his juice.
‘His Lordship was hounding McGonagall the whole time we were gone, spent every waking hour
hanging around, demanding she “produce” Hermione. He was told there were people out looking for
us, but he had it in his head she’d eloped with you.’
Harry sprayed pumpkin juice out of his nose. ‘What?’
‘You heard. So now she’s outside trying to convince him that the three of us spent the past week in
a dungeon under the church being held by Voldemort.’ Ron shook his head. ‘I’m telling you Harry,
he’s going to be trouble when she finally does pluck up the nerve to tell him.’
‘Well, maybe we should go down there.’ Harry said ‘Check and see if she’s alright.’
‘What, and get our heads chewed off? No thanks. She thinks she can handle him, let her try.’
Harry narrowed his eyes. ‘Your dieing to go down there and see what’s happening.’
‘No I’m not.’ Ron said unconvincingly. ‘And anyway, I was down there and she told me to push off.’
Harry looked at him knowingly ‘You were teasing her mercilessly, weren't you?’
‘That’s not the point, is it?’
Just as Ron was speaking, Hermione clambered through the portrait hole looking rather dishevelled,
and spotting them, she headed straight for the stairwell to the girls dormitories. Ron stood up
suddenly, calling after her as he walked speedily towards her, but she ignored him and disappeared
behind the pillar. In a fit of fury, Ron shot up the stairs, but even as Harry tried to yell out a
warning, there was a loud clunking sound and Ron came sliding down feet first on his stomach. Red
faced and fuming, he picked himself up as several Slytherin sixth years laughed, and stared up the
stairwell as it clunked back into place.
‘Next time she goes, we’ll follow her, just to make sure.’ Harry said, appearing at Ron’s shoulder.
He grunted and let Harry guide him back to the chairs.
‘Where’s the cup?’ Harry asked as he leaned forward so they weren’t overheard.
‘We buried it in the secret passageway that’s blocked with rubble.’
Harry nodded. It seemed like as good a place as any since it was not only secret, but also
completely useless. ‘We have to figure out how to destroy it before we bother retrieving it.’ He said.
Ron and Harry spent the rest of the day in the restricted section of the library looking up curse-
breaking spells. They compiled a list of the most likely types that were used against the darkest
magic, jumping frequently at the sudden and impatient shooshing noises of Madam Pince who
hovered and pounced every time Ron’s hunger pangs gurgled loudly. Finally Harry folded the piece
- 196 -
of parchment and stuffed it in his pocket before motioning to a relieved looking Ron to head down
to the Great Hall.
Saturday nights in the Great Hall were usually a light affair as Students and teachers alike revelled
in being in the midst of a weekend off. When Harry and Ron entered, they were beckoned eagerly
by Seamus and Colin, who were already tucking into their food, but Harry saw Ginny sitting
opposite them one seat from the end of the table and was about to suggest Ron take the seat next
to her when Ron sped away from him, the smell of the food being too much for him to resist, and
planted himself next to Seamus, the last spot on that side of the bench. He then started piling his
plate high with food, oblivious to the position he had just landed Harry in.
So Harry took up the last spot on the end of the bench, Ginny sitting on his right, and grabbed the
first thing that was in front of him, spooning the mushy peas onto his plate. He was so engrossed in
trying to ignore Ginny’s presence that it wasn’t until the fifth spoonful that he remembered he hated
mushy peas. After collecting a few foodstuffs he did like, he ate in silence, listening to the others as
they talked about things that seemed altogether too normal to Harry.
He could feel Ginny’s eyes boring into him challengingly as he finished his last potato, his plate still
laden with five serving spoons full of thick gooey peas. He looked at the green swamp, knowing full
well that Ginny knew he hated it, but defiantly stuck his fork in, watching it ooze off the sides as he
brought it to his mouth. It took all his effort to swallow, but he continued to shovel in forkful after
forkful, slowing down dramatically the more he ate, until he was halfway through, and that blissful
moment finally arrived. The plate vanished and dessert appeared next. Unfortunately, by this time
he felt quite as green as the peas he had been eating, so he left the table and headed back to the
Common Room, cursing Ron under his breath.
Hermione was sat with a blanket wrapped around her staring into the fire of the otherwise empty
Common Room when he emerged through the portrait hole. ‘Why didn’t you come down to dinner?’
He asked, suspecting he already knew the answer. She looked at him briefly before turning back to
the fire. ‘I wasn’t hungry.’
Harry frowned as he approached her, not sure if he had seen what he thought he had. She wiped
the edges of the blanket to her cheeks, confirming his suspicions. He rounded her chair and
crouched down before her, his stomach sickening even more than it was already.
‘Hermione, did he hurt you?’ At Harry’s words she looked back at the fireplace.
‘That depends on who you are talking about. If you mean Zach,’ she met Harry’s determined gaze
‘No, of course not. He’s always been such a gentleman, even if he is a little … over demonstrative.
Ron on the other hand’ Tears welled in her eyes again. ‘Why does he have to be the way he is?’
Harry breathed a sigh of relief as he took Hermione’s hands in his. ‘You know he only says those
things because he’s mad with jealousy.’ Hermione appeared unconvinced as she looked down at her
lap. ‘And because he’s a stupendous git.’ He added, still annoyed about the mushy peas. Hermione
smiled in spite of herself. ‘When you were passed out in the cage, he was frantic, wouldn’t shut up
for hours trying to get a word out of you.’ Harry let her hands go.
‘He even told me he might never forgive me for not caring when you were in a bad way.’ Unable to
meet her in the eye, he said ‘and then you go and bring me back from the dead. I owe you debt
Hermione… one that I hope I’m never called on to repay.’ Hermione opened her mouth, but
whatever she had been about to say, she was cut off by the sound of a bunch of rowdy Hufflepuffs
as they entered the room.
Harry took out the list he and Ron had made in the library and handed it to her before slumping into
the other armchair by the fire. She scanned the list quickly and Harry knew by the look on her face
that there wasn’t one spell on there that would work. She leaned forward when she saw the
frustration on Harry’s face. ‘Harry, we are going to need help on this one, and I have a fair idea who
to ask.’
~*~*~*~
- 197 -
The next morning as Harry knocked on the office door in the dungeons, it struck him how he had
known what Hermione was going to say the night before. His own thoughts had strayed to Professor
Slughorn after he had left McGonagall’s office. He was one of the few people who seemed to have a
good working knowledge of Horcruxes, though he had always seemed loathed to admit it. Maybe
that was the real reason Voldemort wanted to recruit him.
The door opened, rousing Harry from his thoughts.
The Professor was still in his night attire, the same expensive looking green velvet dressing-gown
and matching nightcap as when Harry had disturbed him last time this early on a weekend morning.
‘Oh’ he said, sounding like he would rather have had an enormous angry troll standing at his door
than Harry.
‘I need to speak to you, Professor.’ Harry said ‘Can I come in?’
Slughorn peered over his shoulder as if he was being interrupted. ‘Well actually, I am rather busy.
Perhaps you should come back tomorrow, hmm?’ He replied as he closed the door, frowning when it
wouldn’t shut completely and banging it against Harry’s carefully placed foot a couple of times
before looking down and realizing what the problem was.
‘This cant wait, Professor.’ Harry said, leaving his foot where it was. Slughorn sighed and pulled the
door open, stepping aside and waving his arm, motioning Harry to enter. ‘Very well, if you will not
be put off.’
As Harry suspected, the room was empty of people, but just as crowded with Slughorns comfort-
collectables, and still overly warm as he remembered it. He waited for Slughorn to close the door
before perching himself awkwardly on a tasselled footstool. ‘Professor, what do you know about
destroying a Horcrux?’ Harry saw Slughorn shudder visibly as he stopped abruptly on his way to
what was obviously, going by the worn out dent in the cushy upholstery, his favourite chair.
‘Not exactly the type of conversation one is used to first thing in the morning.’ He replied. Harry
could tell by his reaction he was not completely surprised by his question. ‘I imagine you have a
very good reason for almost putting me in an early grave.’
‘Yes sir, I do.’
Slughorn changed direction and sidled over to the table crammed with assorted drinks instead.
Harry watched as he poured himself a drink of what looked like firewhiskey with a rather shaky
hand.
‘I’m hunting down the pieces of Voldemorts soul. But I need to find out what to do with one when I
find it.’ At the mention of pieces of Voldemorts soul, Slughorn had downed his whiskey in one gulp,
only to turn back to the table and pour himself another.
‘And why would I have any knowledge about such things?’ he said, his back to Harry with his glass
full.
‘I was with Dumbledore when he went through your memory in the pensieve, sir.’ Harry said.
Throwing his head back, Slughorn tipped the whiskey down his throat. ‘I know it was you who told
Voldemort how to create a Horcrux.’ The Professor banged the glass down heavily on the table
‘I didn’t know…’ he said quietly. ‘I had no idea Riddle was capable of such … heinous acts.’ He was
talking to himself, but then seemed to remember Harry was there and turned to look at him. ‘I
would never have told him how to do it if I thought for one minute that he would use that
information to start creating his own.’ His double chin was wobbling as his mouth quivered. ‘I wasn’t
to know. He was so well liked by everyone. Top of his grade, charming … he had so many friends.’
‘Friends who are now all Death Eaters.’ Harry said. Slughorn pulled back slightly at Harry’s words.
‘Yes.’ He said slowly, seemingly lost in thought. ‘I have been avoiding them for more years than I
care to remember.’ Harry was getting impatient at Slughorns guilty tangents.
‘Professor, how do I destroy a Horcrux?’
Slughorn eyed Harry cautiously. Seeing Harry’s determination, he closed them briefly, sighing
- 198 -
heavily, and then waddled a short distance before sinking into the chair. ‘There is no “one way” to
destroy a Horcrux. He could have sealed each of them differently into their vessels, and most
probably would have.’ He had been staring at the red and green carpet, but now he met Harry’s
gaze. ‘I would have to see it, then maybe I could work out how its been sealed. Maybe.’ He
stressed. ‘Where is it?’
Slughorn had guessed far more than Harry was comfortable sharing, but faced with the prospect of
trying to figure it out alone, Harry knew he had no choice. ‘I’ll show you.’ He stood up, not entirely
sure he was doing the right thing.
‘I’d better get dressed.’ Said the Professor, heaving himself out of the chair. Twenty minutes later
they were standing by the secret entrance.
Harry waited until he was sure the passageway was clear before opening the disused doorway. With
his wand lit, Slughorn followed Harry in a short distance until they reached the rubble. Harry knew
better than to try summoning the Horcrux. Hermione had told Harry she had found a way of
protecting it against such charms, just in case. So he started pulling some of the stones aside. It
wasn’t long before he was wishing he’d brought Ron or Hermione along. They had hidden it well and
Harry was beginning to think he would have to call it off when he noticed a slight distortion of the
rocks.
It was almost a shimmer, but not quite. Harry frowned in concentration as he turned his attention
on it, running his hand over the rocks slowly. A slight tingling sensation crept into the tips of his
fingers. With renewed effort, he pulled away two huge rocks, exposing a glint of gold. Yanking the
cup free he turned to Professor Slughorn.
‘Let me have a look at it.’ He said, holding out his hand expectantly. Harry hesitated as he handed it
over. He watched as Slughorn turned it, eyeing it from every direction. ‘Yes,’ he said slowly,
nervously. His eyes were wide in the small light, giving him a slightly sinister look. Then looking up
at Harry he handed it back to him. ‘Put it back.’
‘But aren’t you going to tell me how-’
‘Its not as easy as that m’boy.’ He said, raising his eyebrows. ‘I’ll need to think about it … do some
research.’
‘Oh,’ said Harry. He placed the cup back in the small hole and flicked his wand to cover it again.
Slughorn told Harry he would have some answers for him by the next morning as they parted.
Harry nodded, noticing the slight glistening of sweat on Slughorns brow. Harry walked away from
the secret passage, making straight for his room, where he pulled out the Marauders map and
checked Slughorns whereabouts. Something about the way he eyed the Horcrux made Harry
nervous. But he felt slightly relieved to see the small dot with Slughorns name over it moving about
in his quarters. Harry’s relief was short lived however as he began folding the map and briefly, out
of the corner of his eye, he thought he caught sight of another dot moving along a corridor on the
seventh floor. And then just as suddenly, it was gone. Malfoy!
Ron waltzed into the room. ‘How’d it go?’ he asked, and then seeing Harry was frowning at the map
he peered over his shoulder. ‘Whacha lookin’ at?’
‘Here!’ Harry said, shoving the map at Ron. ‘Follow me to the seventh floor! And keep an eye out for
Malfoy, I’m going to try to head him off.’ And with that, Harry bolted out of the room at breakneck
speed, Ron in tail, battling to keep up and watch the map at the same time.
Malfoy couldn’t have gone into the room of requirement because the dot was heading in the wrong
direction. So how had he just disappeared? Harry thought as he emerged from several short cuts on
the fourth floor, figuring he had a better chance of catching Malfoy in the corridors. He forced
himself to slow down, drawing his wand from his robes and concentrating hard on the space around
him, not sure what he was looking for. He had lost Ron in his haste so he was going to have to rely
on his wits if he was going to find Draco.
Harry reached the main stairs that climbed to the fifth level, already feeling that his chance had
gone, sure that Malfoy had slipped passed him, when he a familiar feeling overcame him. Protego!
Harry’s training with Sir took over as a white beam of light shot towards him from out of nowhere.
- 199 -
It rebounded off Harry, heading back in the direction it had come.
‘Protego!’ Draco’s alarm was evident in his voice. He had not expected a reaction. Harry had caught
him off guard. Zooming in on the direction it had come from, Harry aimed his wand. Expelliarmus!
His spell hit the staircase, causing the stone to erupt in a dusty cloud. Two students, who had been
watching the exchange from the top of the stairs, ran off up the fifth floor corridor out of sight.
‘Where are you?’ Harry demanded angrily, his wand darting around looking for a target.
23. The Unknown Passage
Harry scanned the area intently, looking for something that would lead him to Draco’s whereabouts.
Then someone skidded into view at the top of the stairs.
‘Is he here?’ Ron asked urgently looking down at Harry. ‘The kids who just ran past me-’
‘Ron, look out!’ But before he could react to Harry’s warning, Ron was hit hard in the shoulder by a
stun almost at point blank range that sent him careering backwards into the fifth floor corridor.
Draco was fleeing back the way he had come. Harry dropped his wand hand and leapt up the stairs
in pursuit.
‘MOVE!’ He yelled. A small group of three or four students were making their way cautiously
towards Ron’s still form sprawled near the top of the stairs. They flattened themselves against the
wall terrified as Harry raced through them. Then something caught Harry’s eye. The corner of a
tapestry half way along the passageway depicting two centaurs gazing at a purple flame on a grassy
knoll, a mesh of stars stirring above them, gently flapped back into place.
He pelted towards it, flinging the ancient wall-hanging aside and squeezing himself into a narrow
opening that was sliding closed. A wave of steamy heat swamped him as the wall shut behind him
with an echoed thud, extinguishing the dim ribbon of light that had filtered through, leaving Harry
enveloped in darkness.
Harry knew he had made a mistake the second he took a step forward. Instead of hitting a hard
surface, his foot plunged into nothingness, and feeling totally disorientated in the utter blackness,
Harry teetered for a moment and then lost his balance. He dropped quickly, and then jarringly
collided with something, yet he continued to fall, being propelled with gathering momentum along a
smooth round, slimy surface. It twisted and turned, grazing Harry’s elbows as he went. Then
without warning, he left the slippery surface and was airborne briefly before thudding face first onto
hard stone.
His head still reeling from dizziness, and his heartbeat racing more than ever, he scrambled to his
feet and lit his wand, trying to find something in the stiflingly hot, damp blackness to focus on.
The minute the light splayed along the glistening stone walls, an ear piercing shrill rang out. The
pitch was so unbearable that Harry doubled up, hands clenched over his ears, and eyelids pressed
tightly together trying to shut out the noise. It was not the sound of the merpeople’s song that
screamed aboveground; it was a thousand times worse. It seemed not only to attack his eardrums,
but pierce his very skin as well, prickling at it with cactus-like spines of painful sound.
Unable to think, Harry curled up against the wall behind him, squirming in an effort to escape the
burning sensation that felt like a fine mist of acid on his skin. But as Harry forced his eyes partially
open in the foggy wand light, hands still pressed firmly against his ears, expecting to see his clothes
morbidly dissolved and melted to his body, astonishingly his jeans appeared whole, untouched. The
painful sound pummelling him relentlessly made tiny specks of light dance sickeningly before his
eyes.
Then a flash of white-hot heat shot through his chest. His grip on his wand loosened, sending it
clattering to the ground. The light dissolved and Harry knew no more.
~*~*~*~
- 200 -
‘Potter …’ Harry felt a sharp jar in his shoulder. ‘Potter!’ Struggling to open his eyes, his head
throbbing painfully, Harry’s gradual recognition of the cold voice of Draco that intruded on him sent
his pulse racing, rousing him fully. But as he urgently tried to lift himself, he found he couldn’t move
his arms or legs. Wrenching at the binds around his wrists and ankles furiously, he stopped dead as
the sole of a shoe pushed against the side of his face with spiteful force, shoving his cheek into the
warm wet surface he was lying on.
A cold, contemptuous laugh broke the silence. ‘Well, well … we meet again.’ Harry could not see
him, but Lucius Malfoy’s voice was unmistakable. A wave of fear gripped Harry as his fingers flexed
uselessly in search of his wand.
‘All but the most dim-witted of NEWT students would have extinguished their wand at the sound of
a Screaming Wraith. It appears Severus is right. Harry Potter is not troubled with the petty art of
learning. Far too mundane for the “Chosen One”?’
‘You shouldn’t have followed me here.’ Draco said sourly as he leant down, planting his pale face at
an odd angle in front of Harry’s, his black Death Eater robes draped loosely around him. Lucius
increased the pressure of his foot on Harry’s head warningly, as he tried to jerk free.
‘You’re leaving us no choice but to do something about you.’ Lucius drawled.
‘Get-off-me!’ The words came out muffled through distorted lips as Harry seethed in anger. Lucius
dug his foot further into Harry’s cheekbone. ‘I’m-warning-you…’
‘What?’ Lucius drawled sarcastically ‘what is it exactly you plan to do? Since you do not have a
wand, nor even a free fist or leg, your limited magical skills, as well as your primitive mudblood
tendencies are of no use here. Perhaps you plan to talk incessantly until you manage to bore us to
death with your usual drivel?
‘Then again, maybe you have something even more delightfully woeful to share with us?’ Harry felt
a pang in the pit of his stomach as he watched a malicious smile creep across Draco’s lips. Lucius
continued, ‘Though I should warn you, if you’re planning on reciting the grim details of your
deplorable personal life with Miss Weasley, I may be inclined to lose my patience.’
Draco sniggered as the pang in Harry’s stomach swelled into full-blown nausea.
His anger exploded suddenly, and with an all-mighty lunge, Harry wrenched free of Lucius’s foot
and brought his bound legs crashing into the back of Draco’s knees. Draco let out a painful groan as
he crumpled to the ground.
Harry shuffled into a wall behind him, coming to a rest, sitting upright with his bound arms tucked
behind him. ‘If you go near her’ he said, his voice sounding strange ‘it’ll be the last thing you ever
do!’
For the first time, Harry could see Lucius as he rounded on him, wearing the same pitch-black robes
Draco wore. With his long pale hair and the angle of the strange coloured light that barely shone
from Draco’s wand casting long shadows across his sleek face, he looked even more sinister than
usual.
‘You are hardly in a position to threaten anyone,’ He said darkly, bringing his wand only inches from
Harry’s face. It was obvious he was on the verge of cursing Harry into oblivion, but the anger that
flooded through Harry over-rode any fear he should be feeling.
‘I mean it.’ With a piercing, deadly gaze, Harry held Lucius’s pale eyes as he spoke slowly and
deliberately. ‘If you, your son … or anyone else touches her … ’
Draco had picked himself up off the floor and now rounded on Harry, furiously. ‘You wont live long
enough to worry about the Weaslette, Potter! One day soon-’
‘One day soon,’ Lucius cut in coolly, ‘you will face the Dark Lord, and you’re life will be a living
nightmare.’
- 201 -
‘Right,’ Harry said sarcastically. ‘As apposed to the dream come true that it is now?’ He was shifting
his body slowly, trying to ease it into a position where he could get to his feet. ‘You may not know,
not being one of Riddle’s closest cronies anymore, (Draco looked outraged) but I spent the last
week facing him, and yet … here I am!’
Lucius raised an eyebrow, looking down at Harry malevolently. ‘You escaped him?’ A faint smile
edged Lucius’s thin lips. Harry had expected the revelation to anger him, possibly even incite fear,
but Lucius looked amused. ‘Even you cannot possibly be that ludicrously dull. Tell me,’ Lucius
leaned in uncomfortably close to Harry’s face, ‘did you ever bother to ask who it was that released
you from your bonds? … No?’ He shook his head slowly and drawled ‘Oh dear, oh dear! Still, I
suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. You cant even find something that is right under your no-’
‘Father!’ Draco said sharply. He sounded nervous as he watched Lucius with a mixture of fear and
warning. Lucius eased himself upright.
‘Lumo Sepia!’ He snapped. His wand instantly glowed in the same eerie light that Draco’s gave off.
‘You are fortunate the Dark Lord wants you alive,’ Lucius bitterness was evident as he sneered down
at Harry. ‘Though, you will not think so when he comes for you.’
Harry narrowed his eyes at Lucius’s smooth grin. Anger pulsated through him as he finally wriggled
up the wall into a standing position. ‘Next time we meet, I’ll wipe that smile off your face!’
Lucius glared at Harry, his knuckles whitening over the grip of his wand as it shook slightly, and
through gritted teeth he said ‘Oh, I do so look forward to you trying. In the meantime,' Lucius
waved the tip of his wand and the ropes slid from Harry 'let's see how you deal with your present
state of affairs.'
Lucius's malicious smile disappeared along with the rest of him as the glow from both his and
Draco's wands retracted and Harry was plunged into darkness once more.
There was a brief sound of cloaks fluttering in the darkness as Harry imagined Lucius and Draco
making their escape … then nothing.
‘Great!’ Harry said under his breath. ‘Now what?’ He stood in black silence, swamped in sticky heat,
and concentrated.
Accio wand!
Nothing. A drip echoed somewhere near as Harry squeezed his eyes tightly shut and said aloud
‘Accio Wand!’
Still nothing.
The drip seemed to grow louder in the stifling silence, and then Harry felt something brush past his
leg. He stepped back in alarm.
A waft of humid air swept around him, ruffling his hair slightly, triggering a growing unease in the
pit of his stomach. Almost unsure if his eyes were open or closed anymore, Harry reached his arms
behind him and felt for the wall, planting his hands firmly on the warm slimy surface in an effort to
get his bearings.
The waft gently grew into a steady breeze and Harry’s heartbeat quickened with the looming
certainty that he was not alone. As dreaded confirmation, a fuzzy blue-green glow appeared in the
distance. At first, he thought he had imagined it, but as it spread out along the glistening rounded
surfaces, it pushed the air ahead of it with a quickening speed, blowing Harry’s jacket out around
him.
Harry looked down suddenly in the blurry light. Something had curled itself around his leg.
‘Socks?’ Ginny’s cat was staring up at him, her tail flicking wildly as her hair ruffled in the wind. She
pressed her head into his shin then sniffed the ground.
There, almost undetectable, lying on the damp stone at Harry’s feet was his wand. He bent down
- 202 -
and scooped it up, looking in wonder at Socks as she turned in the direction of the blue-green light,
which lit up the surroundings. Following her gaze, he was horrified to see that a huge shadow was
visible in the midst of the eerie glow, drifting straight for him with ever increasing speed. The wind
rushed at him as Socks scooted across to a small fissure in the stone wall, and disappeared.
Harry glanced back at the encroaching shadow, raising his wand, his mind racing. His hair and
clothes blustered about him as he looked around him desperately for a way out. Then Socks
reappeared through the wall. She growled at Harry, lifting her paw up and clawing at the air, and
then darted back through it. Harry knew she was trying to get him to follow her, yet there was no
way he could fit through the narrow gap, but he bolted towards it in an effort to put some distance
between him and the shadowy light that was hurtling towards him.
Then quite suddenly, the light died, the wind dropped, and all was silent again.
Harry listened to the sound of his rapid breathing in the blackness as he turned back towards the
now non-existant light. This cannot be good, he thought. A tingling sensation crept up his spine and
he knew whatever had been within the light was almost upon him. He had to do something, fast!
‘Lumo Sepia!’ His wand ignited in the same eerie light that the Malfoy’s had given out.
Harry froze at the sight before him.
In the dark light, two monstrous forms loomed barely feet away. They were almost human, but too
reptilian in their features to be considered so. One had an elongated snout and hard armoured skin
like a crocodile, and the other had spiky scales that fanned out along its back and neck like a
prehistoric lizard.
Their bodies were undulating as if fluid-like, glowing fluorescent in the wand light, and both eyed
Harry venomously, baring their dripping, silvery teeth.
A viscous hissing sound brought Harry out of his stupor. Socks was standing at his feet, her hackles
raised and her tiny pointed teeth bared. She let out a low rumble of warning and advanced on the
rippling creatures in what Harry thought was a totally reckless move on her part. They opened their
mouths and the same horrible screeching sound he had heard before accosted Harry, making him
curl into himself as he tried to shut out the noise and pain, but Socks spat and growled savagely,
seemingly unhurt by their wailing.
To Harry’s amazement, they started to retreat as she slunk towards them, but then she turned
suddenly, pouncing on Harry and pushing on his chest with surprising force, sending him reeling
backwards towards the wall.
In shock at her surprise attack, Harry watched as she darted up a small stairwell that had appeared
out of nowhere where before all he could see was the tiny fissure. Realizing she had shown him the
way out, a way maybe he could see only by the Sepia light, he took off after her, his skin burning
and his hands still clenched over his ears, the wraiths in pursuit, following Socks as she leapt up the
stairs turning every now and then to let him catch up.
The stairs ended where a tunnel began, and Harry ran on through it, glancing over his shoulder, but
the painful sound of the creatures at his back seemed to fade as the air became dryer and cooler,
until he could no longer feel his skin burning.
The curved stone walls of the tunnel ended abruptly, leaving only dirt and wood in their wake as it
slanted off at an odd angle. Harry didn’t dare try switching to a brighter light, even though it was
hard going as he tripped and stumbled over what looked like tree roots in the dirt floor. Sock’s tail
flipped out of sight on occasion, but then Harry would see her again standing in the middle of the
tunnel, her eyes glittering in the strange light, waiting for him.
Some way along, the tunnel came to an abrupt end. Socks watched Harry as he came to a stop,
flicking her tail impatiently as she prowled round and around on the spot. Harry looked down at her
expectantly.
‘So, how do we get out?’
She looked up at the tunnel roof above them, and following her gaze, Harry noticed the wood that
- 203 -
was splayed scarce and disorganized in the rest of the roof, seemed to have a much more solid form
directly above them. In the inky light Harry could make out what looked like a trap door, only it
appeared to have no way of opening it.
Not sure if the wraiths were likely to still be following them, Harry wasted no time in blasting it with
a Reducto curse that sent splinters of shrapnel in all directions.
‘C’mon then.’ Socks immediately jumped into Harry’s outstretched arms, and he hoisted her above
him. She leapt clear of him and landed with a light thud on the wood above. Pocketing his wand,
Harry jumped up and grasped the jagged edges of wood, pulling himself up with difficulty until he
was sitting on the edge of the hole.
Looking around him, he could see a huge old wood and iron bed bent up in the middle and lying on
its side, the mattress torn and oozing fluffy green feathers. There was an oversized wooden table
and chairs, an assortment of traps and hanging cured food, pots and pans and other gear dangling
from the roof, and finally a large stone fireplace on the far wall.
Hagrids?
Harry lifted himself to his feet and looked back at the ruin of floor where Hagrids bed used to be.
Hagrid had not long had his hut rebuilt after last years fire; Harry didn’t relish the thought of telling
him he had made a crater in the middle of the floor and destroyed his bed into the bargain. He took
out his wand and tried to repair the damage; the bed heaved slightly and groaned as the iron
moved reluctantly, but then it merely collapsed in on itself even further. Deciding it was best left to
someone more skilled, Harry grabbed Socks and headed to the door, walking out into the cold mid-
morning light.
~*~*~*~
‘Harry! You’re filthy! What happened?’
Harry looked down at his clothes as he buried his fingers in the fur of Sock’s neck. He was indeed,
filthy. His shoes, which were once white, were coated in black slimy mud, along with the whole back
and left hand side of him.
‘Is Ron okay?’ he asked as he met Hermione’s scowl.
Her face dropped. ‘Why wouldn’t he be?’
‘Oh’ said Harry.
‘Harry, what is going on! Where is Ron, and why wouldn’t he be okay?’ Hermione was standing on
the worn out carpet in the Gryffindor Common Room tapping her foot with her hands on her hips,
and a very fiery look in her eyes.
‘Hello.’
Harry and Hermione turned to see Ginny strolling over to them. She had a rather blank look on her
face as she inspected Harry’s state. ‘I don’t suppose that mud is Peruvian Bugboo-’
But Socks wriggled free of Harry’s grip and leapt at Ginny, seemingly greatly pleased to see her
mistress. She knocked the books out of Ginny's hands, sending them tumbling to the floor. Harry
crouched down with Ginny and helped her gather them up again, leaning in so no one else could
hear.
‘Ginny, we need to talk.’
~*~*~*~
Harry stood up with an armful of books as Ginny smiled and said pleasantly ‘I’ve always liked a
good conversation.’ Surprising Harry with her receptiveness.
- 204 -
‘Not here though!’ Harry said. ‘I have to go and check on Ron first, but then we must talk.’
‘Harry!’
He turned to see Ron coming through the porthole rubbing his shoulder soothingly. ‘What happened
to you?’ he asked grinning as he took in Harry’s slimy clothing.
‘I’ll tell you at lunch. You alright?’
‘Yeah. McGonagall wants to see you though. She wasn’t looking too happy either when she brought
me round. Did you catch up with him?’
‘Who?’ Hermione said impatiently. She was trying to coax Socks to her, but Socks kept darting out
of her reach.
‘We’ll meet at lunch; I’ll fill you in then. Ginny, come on.’ He placed her books on a small table and
grabbed her hand, pulling her to the door.
‘Harry …’ Hermione called out hesitantly. Both he and Ginny turned and looked at her expectantly.
‘Oh, er …' she looked from Harry to Ginny uncertainly 'n-nothing.’ She said in frustration, waving at
a hand at them dismissively and resuming her pursuit of Socks.
Harry led Ginny into the first empty classroom they came to, closing the door behind him before
turning to her gravely.
‘He knows Ginny. Voldemort knows.’ He said quietly, frowning as Ginny flinched slightly.
‘Oh,’ Ginny said, then added vaguely ‘knows what?’
‘About us, of course!’ he said sharply.
‘Oh!’ she said as comprehension dawned ‘that’s not good is it? How did he find out?’ she asked
interestedly.
‘Malfoy, who else?’ Harry said in impatiently, annoyed he didn't seem to be having the impact he
thought was warranted. ‘Anyway, it doesn’t matter how he knows; the point is you are now a
target! This is exactly what I didn’t want to happen!’ He started pacing the floor nervously. ‘He’ll try
to get to you, I know he will! That’s what he does!’ His insides were swirling with painful guilt as he
stopped abruptly, taking hold of Ginny’s arms.
‘Until the Christmas break, you are not to leave the inside of the castle! Do you understand? And
never walk the corridors alone! Always make sure someone is with you!’ he let go of her and started
pacing the floor again. ‘I’ll put the DA onto it.’ He said to himself as his mind raced. ‘I’ll make sure
there is always at least two of them with you wherever you go.’
‘Oh, I don’t think she’ll like that very much.’ Ginny said blandly.
‘Who?’ Harry snapped.
‘Oh … er … maybe you should talk about this later? I'm in a bit of a hurry actually.’
‘What are you talking about?’ Harry stared at her in angry bewilderment, beginning to lose his
temper that she appeared not to be taking his worst fears seriously. She watched him dreamily as
he grabbed her too tightly by the arms and said in almost a yell ‘Ginny, this is important. He knows!
He’ll come after you! He'll use it to get to me if he can. You have to stay hidden, you have to stay
safe!’ He was shaking her as the painful lump in his chest made his eyes water.
‘I cannot let anything happen to you! Do you understand? I wont let you get hurt! I wont let him
take you too! I wont lose you as well! Do you understand me?’ He could feel himself losing control
as his eyes dropped to her mouth. The pain within him branched out, surging through his whole
body as a salty tear threatened to leak behind his glasses. In a fit of desperation, he thrust his lips
to hers, looking for a way to shut out the pain. But he pulled away again prematurely and frowned
as he searched her face. She looked stunned, confirming what he had felt in her lips. The anguish of
it tore through him.
‘Oh ... Oh I’m sorry Ginny. I had no right.’ He let go of her and backed away. ‘I really am sorry …
really I am…’ he could feel himself crumbling as he dropped his gaze to the floor. ‘More sorry than
you can know.’ He walked passed her without looking at her and opened the door, tilting his head in
- 205 -
her direction. ‘Go straight back to the Common Room. And tell Ron he’s to stick to you like glue!’
The guilt that swamped him had Harry so torn up that when he finally reached the Gargoyle; he
stood in front of it unable to utter the password. Ginny was now in serious danger, possibly more
than anyone else, even himself, and it was all because he couldn’t control himself. He should have
stayed away from her after he left her at Dumbledore’s funeral!
Dumbledore … someone who was already no more because of Voldemort. Harry tortured himself
with the knowledge that he had endangered Ginny recklessly.
‘Stupid!’ Harry chided himself angrily through clenched teeth. If Voldemort took her, he would not
kill her straight away. He would surely use her as bait. What would he do to her in that time?
‘Stupid … stupid idiot!’ He said, breathing hard in an effort to reign in his emotions.
‘I doubt that’s the password.’
Lupin smiled faintly as he stopped before the Gargoyle, placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder. He
must have seen the excess water in Harry’s eyes because his smile faded as he studied Harry
intently. ‘What is it? What's happened?’
~*~*~*~
Harry sat in the Head’s office and spilled everything he knew about Draco Malfoy’s whereabouts
when he was in the castle. McGonagall and Lupin listened as Harry told them about the secret
passage that did not appear on his map, and about Lucius and Draco’s presence in the underground
drains. McGonagall rested on her elbow with her fingers to her mouth and a pained expression on
her face as Harry recited as accurately as he could what Lucius had said, leaving out the part about
Ginny, fearing he wouldn’t be able to keep his composure if they dwelled on it.
He told them about the Screaming Wraiths, and the tunnel that led to Hagrid’s, acutely aware that
the paintings were not bothering to hide their interest. The occasional gasp or short disbelieving
comment about Death Eaters roaming the castle at their leisure escaped their lips, and when he had
finished, Lupin was the first to speak.
‘Harry, why didn’t you tell us about Draco when you first saw him?’ He looked weary as he leant
against McGonagall’s desk with his hands in his pockets.
‘Because I wanted to find out what he was up to.’ Harry replied, his eyes on a green, ball-shaped
paperweight that sat atop some parchment on the desk.
‘Don’t you think we might have had a better chance of determining his intentions together?’ asked
Lupin.
Harry sighed heavily. ‘I couldn’t tell you because I’m almost certain it had something to do with the
task Dumbledore left me.’
‘The Horcruxes?’
Harry looked at Lupin in surprise. ‘You know?’
‘Yes, though I have not known for long. I am not privy to all of the information. Professor
McGonagall and Aberforth are the only ones who know almost as much about this as you do. And it
must stay that way. Voldemort could still get information from anyone else if he should happen
upon us.’
‘We must seal the secret passageway, immediately!’ McGonagall said briskly. ‘And Hagrid’s hut will
need to be investigated. I can see how they have utilized the drains, but how on earth they have
been getting into the grounds escapes me!’
‘What about the fireplace?’ Harry said.
‘It’s a definite possibility. They must have built the tunnel between Hagrid’s and the drains. It was
just dirt and wood, you say?’ Harry nodded at Lupin. ‘Then it makes sense that they were able to
get in and out of the grounds through the fireplace, and were using the tunnel to enter the castle.’
- 206 -
He added gravely.
‘I never heard of such a thing!’ one of the most pompous looking of the portraits said huffily. ‘I
thought Hogwarts was supposed to have superior security.’ As the old ex-headmaster pounded his
fist on his armchair for emphasis, a few portraits murmured in agreement.
‘It always did when Albus was here.’ Professor McGonagall looked pale, the news of the infiltration
obviously weighing heavily on her. ‘I am certain that if he were still running things the castle would
have been safe, as it is-’
‘As it is...’
Harry and the others looked at Dumbledore’s portrait at the sound of his voice. He was peering over
his half-moon spectacles at Professor McGonagall. ‘Their secret has been successfully discovered
before they had time to do any real damage.’
‘But do we know that, Albus?’ McGonagall stood up and approached him questioningly. ‘We’re not
even sure what they were doing here in the first place.’
‘I think it is safe to assume that if they had managed to complete their mission, we would know.’ He
glanced at Harry and gave him the slightest wink before turning his attention on Lupin. ‘I trust you
know what to do?’ Lupin nodded. ‘By the way, now would be the ideal time to tell Harry why you are
here, Remus.’
‘Yes, of course. Harry, you will be joining Molly and Arthur Weasley at the burrow for Christmas
again. Members of the Order will be here on Saturday to escort youself, Ron and Ginny onto the
Knight Bus, staying with you to ensure your safety. Molly has also informed me that you are most
welcome to bring someone along, if you wish.
‘Well, I should be going.’ Lupin moved to the door and opened it, and then turning he said to
McGonagall ‘I shall have the passage entrance and Hagrid’s Hut guarded until something more
permanent can be worked out. Harry,’ he said with a nod of his head ‘I shall see you at Christmas.’
Then he turned and left, closing the door behind him.
‘What did he mean,’ Harry asked nobody in particular ‘I could bring someone along?’
‘I am certain you can think of someone who deserves a Weasley family Christmas, Harry.’
McGonagall said as she took his elbow and led him to the door. Harry thought he saw a faint twinkle
in her eye. ‘In the meantime, how is it working out with Professor Slughorn?’
Harry frowned, uncertain of how she knew he had approached him, but looking over her shoulder at
Dumbledore, he wondered no more. Dumbledore nodded slightly.
‘He said he’d have some information for me tomorrow morning.’
‘Very well. I must get on.’ The Professor opened the door and edged him out of her office. ‘It seems
we now have a traitor in our midst, on top of everything else.’
~*~*~*~
‘A traitor?’ Ron breathed. ‘Why does she say that?’ He was sitting next to Hermione at the
Gryffindor table in the Great Hall scooping cauliflower and cheese onto his plate. The ceiling above
them was heavy with grey cloud as the magic rain tumbled down above them.
‘Isn’t it obvious Ron?’ Hermione poked her zucchini absentmindedly. ‘McGonagall would have left
the rebuilding of Hagrid’s hut to people she thought she could trust. Whoever made that tunnel and
bewitched the fireplace so it could be used, must have worked on it.’
‘I’m betting they wont try to use it again.’ Harry said looking at his plate of food with disinterest.
‘Well good! Means we don’t have to worry about Malfoy sneaking around the place.’ Ron stabbed at
his Yorkshire pudding and stuffed it into his mouth. ‘Chunior or shenior!’

‘Hermione, have you done Screaming Wraiths in your defence classes?’ Lucius’s comment about him
not bothering to learn had been playing on Harry’s mind.
‘Well … not really,’ she eyed him knowingly. ‘I mean, they’re in the text books, but we haven’t really
covered it in class.’
‘What do you know about them?’
‘They’re ghosts aren’t they?’ Ron frowned.
‘Wraiths are visible spirits Ron; ghosts are different. A wraith isn’t just an echo of a past life; it has
substance as well as form. It can affect its surroundings, touch things, move them.’ She looked at
Harry pointedly ‘What did they look like?’
As Harry described them, Hermione’s expression darkened. ‘They’re his Harry. They’re Voldemort’s.’
‘What d’you mean?’
‘Wraiths become whatever was in there hearts when they lived. Going by your description, and the
fact that they didn’t seem to bother Lucius or Draco, I’d say they were put there by Lord Voldemort-
’
‘To guard the passage’ Ron finished.
‘Maybe.’ Hermione sounded unconvinced. ‘They might be there to guard something else too.’
‘Like what?’
‘I don’t know.’ she said thoughtfully.
‘Tell me about Lumo Sepia.’ Harry asked, wanting to know everything he could.
‘It means "Dark Light" or more commonly "Black Light."' She said, finally putting her fork down.
‘Screaming Wraiths are sensitive to normal light. As soon as they are exposed to it they, well …
scream.’
‘It wasn’t like any scream I’ve ever heard before.’ Harry said.
‘Their screams alone aren’t deadly, though people have been known to be driven mad when
exposed to them for too long.’
‘What? So they can’t hurt you as long as you don’t use light on them?’ Ron said dubiously.
‘Of course they can. They used screaming as a weapon on Harry, even in the black light, and they
do things, remember? And they apparently have teeth.’ She said flashed an uncomfortable look at
Harry.
‘How come they were afraid of Socks?’ he asked, glad to finally see his untouched plate vanish.
‘It not just Socks, cats are their natural enemy.’
‘Hey, do you think the cups still safe where it is?’ Ron whispered.
‘They don’t know where it is, if they did, they would have taken it by now. If they're even after it.’
Hermione said, looking up as Ginny appeared over Ron’s shoulder.
‘Harry, I need to speak with you.’ She looked slightly paler than usual and Harry could tell there was
something wrong. He left the Great Hall, following her out into the courtyard. It was very cold and
raining heavily still, and neither of them were wearing coats, so they took what shelter they could
under a giant willow.
‘I want to talk to you about what happened earlier.’ Her green eyes fixed on him as he brushed a
hand through his hair in an effort to shake some of the droplets of rain off. ‘There were some things
I should have said, but didn’t.’
‘No Ginny.’ Harry shook his head slightly. ‘You don’t need to do this. It’s okay, I understand.’ His
heart pounded in his chest painfully.
'I don’t think you do.’ She said, a small crease forming between her eyebrows. ‘I will not live in fear
and hiding Harry, and I’m certainly not going to be surrounded by the DA everywhere I go.’
Harry stared at her for a moment. He had thought she was going to talk about what happened when
he kissed her. He had thought she was going to explain why she had not kissed him back, why her
lips had lacked the fiery passion they always held. He had hoped she might open up to him, even
yell and scream at him for his betrayal, or maybe tell him she hadn’t meant to be so cold, finally
finding it in her heart to forgive him. But she had not even noticed.
- 208 -
The pain and hurt that was flooding every part of him began to change, anger once again rearing its
head as he spoke. ‘I know things are different between us now, Ginny. I know it and you know it,
but Voldemort doesn’t. I’m not changing my mind, you need protecting no matter how inconvenient
it is for you.’ He turned away from her and stalked back towards the door. Suddenly, he was yanked
around by an abrupt pull on his arm.
‘Harry Potter, I’ve got something to say and you had better listen!’ They were both standing in the
pouring rain; any shelter now well out of reach. Ginny’s hair, which was only lightly dusted with
raindrops moments ago, was quickly getting soaked flat to her head as droplets of rain tumbled off
the ends of her soft fringe and crept down her face.
‘I will not be dictated to! I don’t care who you think you are!’ Her voice sounded strange as she
poked him in the chest. ‘I will not be followed around or told where I can and cannot go! Have you
got that straight? You are not the only one around here who is entitled to do as you darn well
please!’
Ginny’s cheeks were flushed, and if it wasn’t for the rain, Harry was certain he would have been
able to see tears spilling from her swollen eyes.
‘Do you really think I would be stupid enough to flaunt who I am now that Voldemort knows about
me? Is that what you think? Well it’s about time someone pushed you off that bloody throne you’ve
been sitting on Mr.-Chosen-One and brought you back down to earth where the rest of us live! You
think you’re the only one that knows anything that’s going on! You think you’re the only one who
can do anything about it! Well I don’t want to be the one to burst your bubble, but there are-’
But Ginny never got a chance to tell him what there was. Harry swept her into his arms and bent
down to taste the fire that once again flared after it had lain dormant at their last meeting. She
pushed her fists into his shoulders, trying to pull away, but Harry would not release her. Seconds
later, he did not need to. Her lips were ignited and she kissed him heatedly, putting her arms
around the back of his neck and pulling him to her. Harry was lost for one blissful moment where
there was nothing except Ginny.
Slowly becoming aware that they was standing out in the freezing cold and pouring rain, Harry
slowed his kiss until Ginny’s lips left his reluctantly.
She allowed Harry to take her by the hand, and following him at a run, they headed back inside.
They walked without speaking until they reached the Common Room, and then Ginny made her way
to the dormitory stairs, leaving Harry to ponder how he had ever thought her lips cold.
~*~*~*~
The next morning on his way to breakfast, Harry came across Hunter at the foot of the marble
staircase. He was lingering with a small group of students and appeared to be demonstrating the
effects of a very nasty curse to the sniggering delight of his audience.
‘You’ve never seen someone perform such a pitiful improvement charm on themselves until you’ve
seen Taphet’s effort!’ Hunter gloated. ‘Imagine trying to make yourself taller and ending up with too
much skin! Honestly! It was hanging off him in great wrinkly folds! He looked like my aunt Begonia’s
dog! And I thought that was the ugliest thing I’d ever seen!’ The small crowd guffawed as a very
red-faced young boy with curly brown hair tried to get passed them unnoticed.
‘Hey Taphet!’ Hunter yelled after Peter. ‘Taphet! I could hook you up with my Aunt's dog if you’re
looking for a mate!’
‘Hunter!’ Harry slapped his hand down heavily on Hunter’s shoulder. Obviously taken by surprise,
Hunter glanced up at him in dire disbelief. ‘You must have thoroughly enjoyed cleaning out the
Greenhouses last time Hermione set you to it.’ Hunter grimaced as the other students stared,
unsure of what they should do.
- 209 -
‘You know, I could think of far better ways of spending my last week of lunchtimes before the
holidays, but each to his own I guess. And don’t worry; there’ll be no shortage of dragon dung to
scrape off the floors, that’s always guaranteed! Oh, and its mating season for the Mandrakes if I’m
not mistaken. I’m certain you will find it very entertaining picking up after the wild parties they are
sure to have thrown over the weekend.’ Harry smiled pleasantly as he looked down at Hunters
increasing scowl. ‘Report to Greenhouse three at the beginning of lunch. I will let Professor Sprout
know she can expect you.’ Harry started walking away but turned again calling after him 'Oh, and
I’d stay out of reach of the Venomous Tentaculars too … very nasty.'
The group dispersed and Harry entered the Great Hall, making his way over to Peter who was sitting
alone at the far end of the Hufflepuff table.
‘Hello! Listen, I’ve been thinking,’ Harry sat himself down on the edge of the seat and lazily grabbed
a piece of toast from one of the racks ‘I promised you some one on one time, but I don’t think I’m
going to be able to do it before schools out,’ Peter, who had smiled nervously at Harry when he sat
down, tried to hide his obvious disappointment.
‘It doesn’t matter. I’m rubbish at magic anyway. I’d probably just be wasting your time.’ The boy
said sincerely.
‘Oh,' Harry said brightly, 'then it is just as well I was going to ask you if you would come and stay
with some friends and me over Christmas then, isn’t it? Sounds like you could use the practice!’
‘But … under age wizards aren’t allowed to do magic outside of Hogwarts.’ Peter said, with a hint of
excitement.
‘That will not be a problem where we’re going.’ Harry said casually as he bit down on his toast ‘So,
what do you say? Wanna come?’
When Harry got back to the Gryffindor table, he was feeling very pleased with himself. Peter had
accepted the offer of Christmas at the Weasleys, and assured Harry he would be ready to go with
them on Saturday. And the thought of Hunter elbow deep in droppings instead of enjoying his lunch
this afternoon brought an immensely satisfying grin to his face.
Harry was just about to start loading his plate, his appetite fully returned, when Hermione swooped
in on him, the look on her face nothing short of horrified.
‘Harry! The cup … its gone!’
24. The Order’s Secret and the Lion's cub
As he ran up the stairs and through the corridors, Hermione at his heels, Harry thought desperately
that she had just missed it somehow. He, himself had found the cup difficult to find when he had
been showing it to Slughorn, and since he was the last person to have it, it was perfectly plausible
that she wouldn’t be able to find it. Harry had sensed its whereabouts last time, and would again;
he just needed to get there. Yet even as he told himself this, dread flooded him.
Ron was standing outside the passageway when they arrived with a pained expression on his face.
Without a word, Harry drew his wand, lit it, and sped into the open entrance, jogging the short
distance to the rubble. Rocks were spread on the floor of the passageway where Ron and Hermione
had scattered them in their desperate search, and as Harry made his way through them, Hermione
came up behind him, panting.
‘Its not here, Harry! We looked … its gone!’
‘Bring your light over here!’ he ordered as he extinguished his and slid the wand into his jean
pocket. She edged her way over the debris as Harry began running his hands gently over the stone.
‘What are doing?’
‘Sh! I’m trying to see if I can feel it.’
Hermione watched him silently as he traced the outline of the rocks. At one stage he thought he
could feel something creeping into the tips of his fingers, but after he heaved a few stones aside,
the sensation was gone. It wasn’t long before the dread that sat like a knot in his stomach, twisted
into anger and frustration, and with a heated growl he turned.
- 210 -
‘Slughorn!’
He pushed past Hermione and made his way quickly back into the corridor, his anger at Slughorns
betrayal seething within him.
‘Where are you going?’ Ron asked as Harry emerged and stalked off.
‘I’m going to kill him!’ Harry said viciously over his shoulder.
‘Harry!’ Hermione was stepping quickly behind him in an effort to keep up with his angry strides.
‘Do you really think he would steel the cup?’ she questioned.
‘Yeah,’ said Ron, as he too caught up after having sealed the passage. ‘Its more likely the Malfoy’s
took off with it, isn’t it?’
‘You didn’t see the look on Slughorn’s face when I showed it to him!’ Harry said through clenched
teeth. ‘I knew he was up to something. He’s the reason I was checking the map in the first place
yesterday! I can’t believe I was stupid enough to show him where it was!’
When he reached the door to Slughorn’s office, he pounded his fist on it and turned the handle
immediately, not waiting for an answer, but the door wouldn't open. Harry drew his wand and
pointed it at the lock.
‘Harry! It’s a teacher’s private quarters! You can’t just unlock it-’ But Hermione’s warning was
interrupted by a frustrated growl as Harry pushed on the door after having tried to unlock it
magically, and it still wouldn’t budge.
Harry took a couple of steps back and pointed his wand at the door.
‘What are doing?’ she squeaked.
Hermione gasped and Ron swore as the door suddenly exploded, sending shrapnel flying into the air
and showering the three of them with splinters of wood.
‘Geez Harry!’ Ron gawped in a half laugh as Harry strode the few steps into the Potions Masters
office, inspecting the room before him.
Nothing was out of place; the room was exactly as it was when Harry had been there the morning
before, except of course, for the pieces of Slughorn’s door which now littered the area in front of the
trio, and ... a pair of shiny black shoes on the floor, which pointed to the ceiling as they jutted out
from behind the comfortable chintz sofa that backed onto the Professor’s sleeping quarters. Harry
walked hesitantly towards them, stopping when he rounded the couch.
Slughorn was lying on his back, eyes wide open and his mouth gaping as if quite literally frozen in
fear. Harry’s anger ebbed as he crouched down over the still form. Reaching out, he gently peeled
the chubby fingers from the golden cup clasped to the Professor’s rounded stomach.
‘Go and get McGonagall,’ he said gravely as Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth. ‘Tell her
he’s still alive, but needs a hospital.’ Hermione retreated immediately. Harry lifted the cup and
turned it over in his hands. A large crack ran from the lip to the base.
~*~*~*~
Days later they were still trying to piece together what had happened, but whatever his motives one
thing was clear; Slughorn had destroyed the Horcrux. McGonagall had shipped him off to St Mungos
and Harry made a point of asking everyday for news, but there was no change in his condition.
‘I’m glad it wasn’t you, Harry.’ Hermione had said on more than one occasion, and maybe because
Harry wasn’t angry with Slughorn anymore, he didn’t share her view. It was his fault that Slughorn
had the cup, and guilt prickled at him that he had somehow managed to get out of destroying it
unscathed.
‘He deserved what he got, if you ask me,’ said Ron ‘He shouldn’t have told Riddle how to make a
Horcrux in the first place!’
‘Tom would’ve found out some other way.’ Harry commented.
With only four days until the Christmas break, Harry called a meeting of the D.A. He decided the
- 211 -
Room of Requirement was still the best place, so the trio sent word out, and before the afternoon
was out, everyone who was enlisted had been informed. After dinner, Harry headed up to the
seventh floor with Ron and Hermione in tow. He rounded the corridor with the expectation that
maybe a dozen people would be waiting for them, and was somewhat taken-a-back by what lay in
wait.
There were the old D.A. members milling around beneath the tapestry of the dancing trolls, which
included Dean, Seamus, Lavender, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie, Justin, Hannah and Anthony
Goldstein, Michael, Susan, Terry Boot, Luna and Ginny, yet there was also two Ravenclaw seventh
years, Neil Sanders and Lucinda Kellynack, standing with a girl Harry had met briefly last year and
whose name he couldn’t remember but her parents owned a string of apothecaries, a small gaggle
of sixth and seventh year Hufflepuff girls who were giggling and whispering while shooting looks at
Harry, and lastly, Blaise Zabini, who was eyeing Harry challengingly as he stood with two other
sixth year Slytherins Harry had only ever had dealings with when dishing out punishments.
‘What are they doing here?’ Ron asked under his breath.
‘They asked about the D.A., so I gave them the details of the meeting.’ Hermione said matter-of-
factly.
‘Zabini’ Harry said in cautious greeting as he stopped outside the already materialized door. Zabini
merely motioned his head in return. Everyone cleared the way for Harry to open the door, and then
filed in after him. He waited until they were all seated on one of the many cushions spread
throughout the room, and the door was secured behind them, before speaking.
‘Hogwarts is not safe.’ He started gravely ‘Death Eaters have been roaming around beneath us the
whole time we’ve been here.’ Gasps rang out, and eyes boggled out of their gaping faces, but no
one spoke; they sat with their wide-eyes glued to Harry as he continued. ‘It’s time for us to
mobilize. We need to pool our resources and help McGonagall keep an eye on the castle. It’ll be our
job to be on the look out for anything … or anyone that shouldn’t be here. Hermione,’ he said,
turning to her, ‘can you make out a roster for people to check the passageways between classes?’
‘I’ll need everyone’s timetables when we get back to the Common Room.’ She said tentatively. ‘I
can have something worked out by morning.’
‘Good, and it’ll need to include the grounds as well.' he turned back to the rest of the room. 'Myself,
Ron and Hermione will continue to do the night shifts; the rest of you can cover the days.’ Harry
look out at the anxious faces before him. ‘We’ll have to start conducting regular meetings, so I’m
suggesting we start with another one on the first school night when we get back from Holidays,
same time and place. Between now and the break, if you see or hear anything suspicious, report it
to one of the three of us immediately.’
‘Does this have something to do with that night you saw Malfoy?’ Seamus asked.
‘Yes, it does.’
For the rest of the meeting, Harry was bombarded with questions about Draco and his father’s
activities. He wasn’t able to tell them much as he had no idea himself what they were doing, which
only seemed to unnerve everyone all the more, and as Harry described the screaming wraiths that
lurked beneath them, there was much head-turning and whispered murmuring.
More to make them feel like they could do something to help protect themselves than actually
thinking it was necessary, Harry advised them to learn the Lumo Sepia charm and to find out
everything they could about the wraiths in the unlikely event they should find themselves face to
face with one. Before he dismissed the meeting, Harry asked Dean, Seamus, Ernie and Justin to
stay behind. They hung back as the rest slowly trickled out the door, all except Zabini who
approached Harry once most of the crowd had gone.
‘What would Death Eaters be doing at Hogwarts?’ He had asked it without any trace of scepticism,
and was watching Harry intently.
‘We don’t know.’ Harry replied shortly, not at all sure he should be comfortable having Zabini in on
their dealings. Zabini looked away thoughtfully and muttered something under his breath that he
knew they had been up to something before turning back to Harry and added ‘Whatever our
differences, I don’t like what’s happening anymore than you. I’ve got plans of my own when I leave
Hogwarts, and things going the way they are, is … less than ideal for me. I’m not promising
anything, but I’ll put some feelers out and see what I can reel in.’ He turned, and Harry watched his
- 212 -
back as he left the room.
‘What did he want?’ Ron asked as Hermione and the others gathered round.
‘I don’t know, but he might prove useful.’ Harry said grimly. ‘Anyway, I called on you, because I can
trust you not to say anything,’ he looked around at their expectant faces, ‘especially to Ginny. She’s
in trouble, more trouble than she knows, and its up to us to keep an eye on her. I want someone on
her every waking hour until schools out. Hermione, you’ll get her timetable with all the others
tonight. I want you to work out the rosters so that not only are the passages and corridors covered,
but Ginny as well.’ Hermione gave him a worried look.
‘I don’t mean to sound difficult,’ Dean interjected, ‘but she isn’t going like that one bit!’
‘That’s why it has to be done carefully. She doesn’t have to know she’s being followed if we plan it
right.’
‘Why does she need following?’ Ernie piped up with a bemused look on his face. ‘She doesn’t come
across as the “damsel in distress” type to me.’
Harry breathed out heavily; he hadn’t wanted to have to explain. ‘Voldemort has been told Ginny
and I were together.’
‘But that’s history isn’t it? I mean, you broke up, right?’ asked Justin. Harry stared at the floor.
‘Yeah, but he doesn’t know that. He’ll try and get to her if he can.’ He hated saying it out loud; the
guilt twisted in him painfully.
‘I’ll work it out,’ Hermione said, watching him. ‘I’m sure between the seven of us we can keep her
covered.’
‘Don’t worry,’ Dean said solemnly, ‘if its that important, we wont let her out of our sight.’
~*~*~*~
The last few days of school went quickly as the weather cooled and the snow began to fall once
more, and by the time Saturday morning rolled around, Harry was beginning to feel nervous about
leaving Hogwarts. He knew McGonagall was working with The Order and the Ministry to ensure the
castles safety, but once he and the others left for The Burrow, The Order would be concentrating on
keeping the place where “Harry Potter” was spending Christmas safe. McGonagall had told him the
Ministry would be placing live-in Ministry Guards over the holidays, and that she and several of the
staff would be remaining, she also informed him that Hagrid was returning in a few days, all of
which helped stay some of his fears.
Tonks, Sturgis and Hestia were standing in the snow waiting for them just inside the gates, all of
them rugged up to the eye balls and beating their hands against the cold as Harry and the other's
strolled out into the grey day. After a rather intimidated and shy Peter was introduced, they shuffled
through the gates as other students passed them accompanied by nervous looking parents. They
waved a hasty goodbye to Hermione, who was apparating out; not at all happy her parents had
insisted she go home for the holidays. She was holding out that they would let her go a week early,
allowing her join Harry and Ron at The Burrow eventually.
Tonks took charge of Peter’s luggage, morphing her features to do a convincing impression of
Professor Flitwick giving nervous instructions on the levitating charm on Peter's trunk whilst
pretending to duck for cover and finally toppling off the stack of books he was always mounted on.
The young boy took to her immediately.
‘Why aren’t we apparating?’ Ron said as he helped Tonks to her feet as she resumed her usual
appearance.
‘We are!’ she said. ‘The Knight Bus is going to be full. It seems most people feel it’s the fastest and
safest way to travel under the circumstances, and its not a good idea for us to endanger the other
passengers.’ She shot Harry an apologetic look.
‘I-I-I can’t a-apparate…’ came a small voice near Harry’s elbow.
‘I’ll take you,’ Tonks said brightly, ‘someone else can bring your trunk.’ Peter flushed as she
instructed him to grab her arm tightly, and a few suffocating seconds later, they were all at The
Burrow.
- 213 -
Harry had a shock as Mrs. Weasley rushed out the front door, waving her arms madly and singing
greetings at the top of her voice. She looked much thinner than she had done even at the beginning
of school term, and there were dark shadows under her tear stained eyes. She grabbed each of
them in turn, pulling them to her and squeezing so tightly her fingers went white.
Harry felt slightly nauseas as he watched her almost lift Ginny off the ground. He didn't relish her
reaction when he told her about the danger her daughter was now in because of him, and the guilt
weighed heavily on his chest. It wasn’t a conversation he wanted to rush into, but he knew both Mr.
and Mrs. Weasley had a right to know.
‘Oh!’ she said as she wiped at her damp cheeks, ‘You’re finally here!’ sounding almost as if she
couldn’t believe it. Then she launched into another round of hugs before stopping in front of Peter.
‘And you must be Harry’s young guest!’ Harry had sent one of school owls with a note earlier in the
week to let Mrs. Weasley know Peter was coming, certain that even though he had told Ron, he
wouldn’t have passed on the information. She put her arm over Peter’s shoulder and drew him to
her. ‘Well, you just treat this as your home while you’re here! C’mon, lets get inside in the warmth.’
They all bustled up the cleared path through the snow and once inside, they separated off to
unpack. Harry took his trunk up to Fred and George’s old room, while Peter was set up in the Den.
After meeting downstairs again for a deliciously warming lunch of Mrs. Weasley’s homemade
vegetable soup and fresh crusty bread, they retired to the lounge in front of the fire while Mrs.
Weasley quizzed them on the happenings at Hogwarts.
It was obvious as Ron told her about the tunnel under the grounds that she hadn’t heard about it,
and she tried quite unsuccessfully to hide her growing fear and anger by laughing loudly at the most
unfunny things they said. After a long while, she rose and headed for the kitchen.
‘Arthur Weasley, you wait until you get home!’ Harry overheard as she disappeared through the
doorway. The clashing of pots and pans being slammed on benches in angry abuse could be heard
as Ron leaned in sheepishly.
‘I wouldn’t have told her if I thought she didn’t know. Dad should have warned me!’
Peter had been shifting uncomfortably in his chair the whole time they had been discussing
Hogwarts, and Harry noticed his face was somewhat paler than usual.
‘Well it’s not a problem anymore.’ He said, motioning slightly to Peter. ‘The tunnel has been
discovered, so Hogwarts is safe again.’
‘Of course,’ Ron chimed in, picking up on Harry’s hint and glancing sideways at Peter. ‘Professor
McGonagall’s on top of it.’
Ginny sat silently by the fire, the golden light of the flames flickering on her hair. Although Harry
couldn’t see her face, he could tell by the way her shoulders sat that she was tense. Maybe with the
thoughts of how close Voldemort’s Death Eaters had come, it had finally hit home how much danger
she was in. Maybe now she would drop her tough exterior and accept the protection afforded her.
Maybe she would not to return to Hogwarts at all.
Harry stood up and left the room, heading for the back door. It was late afternoon and already the
sun had retreated, leaving a billowy grey blanket of snow under the starless sky. He wandered
across the backyard, crunching crusted snow underfoot, picturing Ginny’s face, as it must have been
in front of the fire. He looked around, but could not see any Order members, yet he knew they were
there; hidden in shadow, or disguised by magic. The sound of boots in the snow coming up behind
him made him turn.
‘I suppose you feel like you’re never alone.’ Ginny said as she watched her feet’s progress in the icy
mounds. She pulled up along side his shoulder without looking at him. ‘I brought you a coat,’ she
held out a thick jacket. ‘You’ll catch your …’ She had been going to say death. ‘… It’s freezing out
here.’ She wrapped her arms about her as Harry donned the warm fleece.
In the pale light, he caught a glimpse of something, and without thinking, he reached up to her
neck and trailed the chain in his hand until it fell on the pendant that nestled between her
collarbones. It was the pendant he had given her when he had left to find the locket, except instead
of a badly tarnished and blackened wheel, it glittered silver in the sparse light. Now that it was
- 214 -
clean, markings could be seen on the five spokes.
‘I cleaned it.’ She said quietly. Harry nodded before letting it fall back to her bare skin. ‘I’ve worn it
since that day you gave it to me … never taken it off.’
They stood alone, awkward silence reining, Ginny scuffing her boots lightly in the snow, and Harry
watching her. He knew she was there for a reason, something other than delivering a coat. He
waited. Then finally she looked up.
‘Don’t tell mum and dad about us … don’t tell them Voldemort knows.’ she said it nervously, unable
to meet his steady gaze, as if knowing his thoughts. Harry continued to silently watch her. ‘They’ll
stop me from going back.’ Her eyes had been roaming the ground, but now she turned them on
him. ‘I want to go back, Harry. I need to go back.’ If telltale fear hadn’t shown in her eyes, it would
have been easy to think her angry the way her brow furrowed under her fiery fringe. She searched
Harry’s face for a reaction, but received none.
‘If-If it makes any difference, I’ll do as you asked. I’ll stay within the castle walls, I wont go out …
not even into the grounds unless it’s safe.’ Her speech was coming faster than normal as she
reached up and lightly grabbed the front of his coat. ‘You can put the D.A. on me … I wont complain
about them following me everywhere … I’ll even make it my responsibility that they’re always with
me!’ There was a look of hopelessness behind her watery eyes as she pleaded ‘Harry, please …
don’t tell them what’s going on … don’t make me have to stay! I have to go back with you when you
go!’
She brought her mouth to his in a desperate kiss, her sudden determination taking Harry by
surprise. The painful feelings that had been burning in him; a melting pot of guilt and anguish, were
doused by the touch of her lips, and he kissed her back with all of the passion that she aroused in
him. And for a moment, it seemed like everything was going to be okay.
She had finally shown him that she wanted him too; needed him as he did her. She had thrust
herself on him when he had remained stiff with resolve … and yet … she had made no mention of
forgiveness. She had not actually said that she wanted him, only that she wanted to return to
Hogwarts. With a terrible unwillingness to let his thoughts interrupt, the realization slowly sank in.
She wanted something from him. Harry grabbed her arms and pulled her away.
Breathing heavily, he asked ‘What do you want from me, Ginny?’ She stared at him with glistening
cheeks in the grey light.
‘I want you to tell me that you wont say anything to mum and dad … Promise me!’
He stepped back, unconsciously increasing distance between them and swallowing the lumpy pain in
his throat.
‘I can’t do that.’ He said grimly. She had kissed him to get around him. To manipulate him. Harry
removed the coat and dropped it at her feet before turning and walking the harsh path back to the
unwelcome warmth.
~*~*~*~
When Christmas day arrived, Harry rose late, as had become his habit since he found it painful to
be in Ginny’s company. He had not yet told Mr. and Mrs. Weasley about their history together, or
the threat that now hung over her, but everyday he reminded himself he would most probably tell
them tomorrow.
He was not feeling at all in the Christmas spirit when he entered the kitchen to find Mrs. Weasley
basting the biggest turkey he had ever laid eyes on. She had pots galore boiling away on the
stovetop and knives chopping carrots and green beans on the benches noisily. Harry sat down
wondering where everyone else was, at least until she started huffing over getting the impossibly
large turkey back in the oven, (which Harry was certain had already been magically enlarged for the
occasion) and finally sensing why no one else was in sight and not wanting to be on the receiving
end of her frustration either, Harry decided to skip breakfast and rose from the table quickly before
she noticed him, and headed for the lounge.
- 215 -
As he suspected, the rest of the household, including Mr. Weasley, Bill and Fleur were spread
around the furniture in front of the fire, and upon his entrance, they looked up anxiously, but seeing
it was Harry, not Mrs. Weasley, relief flooded their faces and they went back to either staring off
into space, or chatting to the person next to them. Ginny was busily putting up Christmas
decorations, gradually turning the room into a spangled forest of tinsel, but Fred and George were
yet to show, and Charlie, Harry had been told, was not making the trip across.
As the morning drew on to afternoon, other people began arriving, and it wasn’t long before Harry
understood why Mrs. Weasley had needed such an enormous bird. Not only had Lupin and Tonks
shown up, but several other Order members as well. Apparently they were taking it in shifts; while
some would be inside enjoying a Christmas dinner, others were outside on guard until it was their
turn. When Fred and George made their entrance, they greeted Harry heartily before offering to
help Mrs. Weasley with the food. She shooed them out heatedly after they managed to turn a
second pot of asparagus on its head “accidentally”.
‘Alright, Potter?’ Moody growled as he made his way to Harry and Ron.
‘Yeah, you?’
‘Can’t complain, no one to listen to me anyway! I heard about the tunnel at Hogwarts, wasn’t able
to be there myself, but Lupin tells me its under control now.’ His magical eye was scanning the
room, and appeared to be lingering in the direction of the kitchen. ‘Don’t suppose you’ve got any
idea what they were doing there?’
‘No’
‘Strange things are happening all over now.’ Moody said gruffly. ‘Some say they’re just random
occurrences, purely coincidence. Bollocks, I say. They’re all little pieces of a bigger picture if you ask
me, we just got to find a way of stickin ‘em together.’
‘Mad eye!’ interrupted Hestia indulgently. She had obviously been listening, ‘you can’t possibly still
think that poor boys missing body has anything to with his plans.’
‘I do, and if it isn’t then why can’t the Ministry find him, eh? Oh … excuse me, Molly’s needin my
help.’ Harry had been about to ask what body, but Moody melded into the crowd just as Lupin
emerged. He handed Harry and Ron and eggnog each.
‘He’s right about the strange happenings, though.’ Hestia continued, ‘If the whole Quintaped thing
at Halloween wasn’t bad enough, all sorts of stories have come out of it since that just don’t make
any sense.’
‘Oh, that reminds me,’ Ron said to Lupin, ‘I never got a chance to thank you for saving Hermione
and me. Wouldn’t be standing here today if it wasn’t for you!’ he lifted his eggnog in a toasting
gesture. ‘You know, with all the life debts I’m chalking up, I'm beginning to think I would be better
off dead.’
‘What are talking about?’ Lupin took a sip of his eggnog.
‘Halloween!’ Ron said ‘When the Death Eaters had Hermione and me cornered. If you hadn’t come
along when you did I wouldn't like to think-’
‘I didn’t.’ Lupin said with a frown. ‘We found the two of you fast asleep after the Death Eaters
retreated. I thought you knew.’
‘Well who hit Amycus and Avery then?’ Harry asked, his heartbeat unconsciously increasing. Lupin
shook his head slowly.
‘There were no passed out Death Eaters near you when we got there,’ he addressed Ron, ‘just the
two of you slumped in a doorway.’
‘Are you sure no one from The Order did it?’ Harry asked slowly.
‘Absolutely certain! Everyone was accounted for. Maybe you just thought you saw a couple of Death
Eaters, wouldn’t be surprising, the state you were in.’ he said to Ron.
‘What? Its not possible to both hallucinate the same thing … is it?’ Ron scoffed.
‘What about this missing body then?’ Harry pushed, an uncomfortable pounding now growing in his
chest.
‘Who told you about that?’ Lupin asked gravely. Hestia gave him an apologetic look before slinking
into the crowd. ‘This is not really the time to be discussing such matters, its Christmas Day, Harry.’
‘What body?’ Harry said in a way that indicated he was not going to let the subject drop. Something
- 216 -
about Lupin’s reaction told him Lupin was keeping it from him for a reason. Lupin sighed deeply and
turned his eyes to the floor for a moment, before settling on Harry again.
‘Two days after he was killed, Neville’s body disappeared.’
~*~*~*~
Harry felt like the wind had been knocked out of him. Lupin hastily took Harry’s drink from his
tightening grip, shoving their cups into nearby idle hands and edging Harry backwards into a chair.
‘Are you all right?’
‘Wh-what do you … h-how could h-he…’ The words wouldn’t come.
‘Harry.’
But he could barely hear Lupin; he had managed to bury Neville’s death deep within him,
smothering it quickly whenever it threatened to surface, but now the tiny lump that he had
suppressed for so long was expanding rapidly, filling him with the wretched feelings he had
numbed. Harry dropped his head forward as his eyes closed tightly trying to contain the pain and
rage that spread through him.
‘Harry?’ Lupins tentative voice coaxed, ‘I’m sorry. You weren’t supposed to find out, not this way.’
Harry did not lift his head as he spoke, his voice thick with anger. ‘How did it happen?’
Lupin crouched on the edge of the chair next to him. ‘He was taken to the family crypt the evening
after he died and sealed within a tomb.’ Lupin sighed heavily as he shifted uncomfortably. ‘His
grandmother discovered what was left of the broken stone the following morning.’
Harry was sickened to his core. ‘Why would they take him? Hadn’t he paid enough?’ He said in
ghastly bewilderment. ‘What could they possibly gain?’
It was then Harry realized the whole room was silently watching them. Ron’s face was bloodless as
he stared dumbfounded at Harry while the twins were glaring at Mr. Weasley.
‘I can’t answer that.’ Lupin said, running a weary hand through his hair. ‘I wish I could.’
Harry couldn’t bear to sit there any longer; he pushed himself to his feet and made his way through
the parting crowd. He had no idea where he was going, but found himself outside a few seconds
later … walking, making dents in the downtrodden snow, his eyes stinging as the salty water chilled
in the biting cold. He slowed when he reached the garden shed, his hands thrust deeply into his
pockets, turning this way and that, not knowing what to do with himself.
Why hadn’t Lupin told him? Maybe it would have been easier … maybe he would have been able to
do something … Maybe he wouldn’t have felt like his insides were slowly decaying.
Who would do that to Neville? What could they possibly gain from desecrating him? Why couldn’t
Neville rest in peace … he should be at peace! As his rage became unbearable, Harry’s fist flew at
the wall of the shed; the weathered wood caved and shattered as his hand disappeared beyond his
wrist.
A small whimper came from inside followed by a low shooshing sound.
Harry drew his wand and put his hand to the rusty latch, yanking the stubborn door open. Sitting on
a wooden crate beneath the small window were two shadowy figures, one smaller than the other.
Harry squinted as he tried to adjust his eyes to the dim light.
‘Are you going to stand there pointing that thing at us, or are you coming in?’
Harry lowered his wand at the sound of the cool female voice. He moved away from the door slowly,
allowing the light to penetrate the darkness where Ginny sat. She had her arm around Peter’s
shoulders, frowning intently at Harry as the curly haired boy wiped quickly at damp cheeks.
‘You know, most people just knock.’ She said with a hint of impatience. Harry was keenly aware he
had interrupted an awkward moment, and though he instinctively wanted to ask what was going on;
why Peter was so upset, the boy’s obvious embarrassment stayed his tongue; instead he sat down
- 217 -
on a rickety chair opposite.
‘Sorry…’ Peter said in a small voice. Harry leaned forward on his elbows.
‘Don’t be. There are things worth crying over Peter.’ The small boy nodded and stood up, wiping his
hands down his jeans.
‘I-I think I’ll go back inside now.’ He said to Ginny as she got to her feet. She smiled warmly and
nodded her head, and Peter walked out of the door, disappearing behind the wall. Ginny waited until
the sound of crunching snow faded before speaking.
‘He knew Neville.’ She said gravely. ‘He overheard Lupin telling you.’
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. ‘I didn’t know.’ He slouched back on the chair, eyeing the
blood that was slowly beginning to ooze from his scratched and battered knuckles. ‘Its not right,’ he
said as dark red trails ran down his hand. ‘Why does it have to be the innocent people who suffer?
Neville ... even Pete’s been through more than any kid his age should have to go through.’
‘I can think of another eleven year old who’d been through as much, if not more.’
Harry continued to stare at the ruby streaks. ‘It’s different,’ he said ‘Peter is so … young.’
‘So were you.’
The sudden softness of her voice sent an unbidden surge of yearning through Harry. He was
beginning to feel wearied by the emotions that were tearing through him; too much anger and pain
pulsated beneath his dormant exterior as he watched the blood creep down between his fingers and
drip to the floor. He was tired of this war. Tired of fighting. Yet as he sat there, he knew he could
not turn his back on it. Exhausted by sorrow he watched the tiny peppered spots on the floor as
they merged. He needed to purge himself of the poisonous hurt.
Bleed it out.
‘Thanks for not saying anything to mum and dad. I don’t think they’d have let me go back if they
knew.’ Then almost as an after thought, Ginny added ‘You’re not going to tell them … are you?’
‘No, I’m not going to tell them,’ Harry said grimly, ‘but you are.’
Ginny did not answer at first, and he could tell by the sound of her breathing she was restraining
herself with obvious difficulty. Harry still did not look up; instead he watched the small pool of blood
at his feet slowly expand.
‘I can’t.’ Her voice trembled slightly.
Harry stared at the sticky reddish-black liquid darkly ‘It must be important if you’re willing to
continue to deceive and manipulate to go back.’ He finally dragged himself away from the bloods
morbid progress, grabbing Ginny’s wrist sharply as her determined hand headed for his face.
Without releasing it, he drew himself to his feet.
‘How dare you!’ she said heatedly.
‘How?’ Harry said roughly, his own anger ignited. ‘Because only days ago you tried it on me, and it
nearly worked! You almost had me thinking…’ He stopped himself as his heart beat painfully in his
chest.
‘What?’ Ginny said, the anger gone from her voice. ‘Thinking what?’ Harry let go of her wrist and
dropped his gaze, his breathing shaking with uncertainty. He suddenly felt as though he was
standing in quicksand. Right now he was in it up to his neck, and he was almost certain whatever
move he made, he would sink completely. ‘Harry … what were you thinking?’
‘I thought …’ he hesitated.
‘What?’
‘I thought that you might have … forgiven me.’
A horrible silence filled the room as he waited for her to say something, and as it stretched on,
Harry began to sense the awful truth.
‘No, Harry.’ She shook her head slightly. ‘I haven’t quite managed to forgive you, though I have
- 218 -
tried.’ Harry closed his eyes briefly.
‘At least we don’t have to pretend anymore.’ Ginny said flatly.
Harry could feel his heart being squeezed dry. ‘We haven’t needed to pretend for a long time now.’
He said grimly.
‘You’re wrong. I have been pretending, but I don't want to anymore.’ Her eyes betrayed her steady
voice, pooling with water as she stared at him.
‘Harry, don’t you know the effect you have on me?’ Ginny took a step closer to him. ‘When you walk
into the room, every nerve in my body sparks, and every time you leave, you take those tiny pieces
of beautiful light with you. When you’re hurting … its like ... like I can’t breathe until you smile
again. Your touch is all I ever needed, yet you turn me away time and time again.’ She was visibly
shaking yet there was no anger in her voice. ‘And I thought I knew why … I thought I understood
you … and then…’ her eyes dropped to the floor ‘then you made love to Julie.’
‘It wasn’t love.’ Harry said quickly, ‘I-I don’t know what it was … or-or why I did it…’ he felt the
quicksand swamping him, suffocating him. He had to make things right. ‘I-I never wanted to hurt
you. If I could take it back, I would.’
‘She’s had more of you than you were ever willing to give me…’
‘No … no, that’s not true,’ Harry took hold of her arms, desperate to make her understand. She
pushed his hands off and stepped back, her head dropping as she brought the back of her hand to
her mouth.
‘I hate thinking about it, but I can’t stop myself! I see you with her … the two of you together’ she
sank down onto the edge of the crate, staring at nothing in front of her ‘I think about how it must
have felt to you … touching her … her hands on you …’ her brow furrowed, ‘and I start to feel like
I’m drowning with it.’
Harry could feel a hot droplet of guilt and anguish creeping down his cheek as he watched her. He
wanted to go to her, take her in his arms and hold her until she was healed, but his guilt held him
back. ‘I don’t know how I can make things right … tell me how…’
Ginny looked up at him through sorrowful eyes, her voice much calmer now as she spoke. ‘I don’t
know if it can be made right.’
‘You can’t forgive me.’ he breathed in realization.
She pushed herself to her feet and approached him. ‘No, Harry … I can’t forgive you,' she touched
her hand to his cheek 'but I’ll never stop loving you.’
She raised her head and brushed her mouth against his. At her words, the quicksand rapidly
retreated; she had told him she loved him.
Harry closed his eyes to her kiss, gently caressing her soft lips as he breathed in her scent,
immersing himself in the sweet sensation of her touch. The need in him grew as he increased the
pressure of his lips on hers. He wanted to drink her in, fill himself with her. She had said she loved
him...
When she slowly pulled away from him, her lips were full and reddened from his want. ‘Maybe its
something I’ll learn to live with, I don’t know.’ She fixed Harry with her green eyes. ‘What I do know
is I don’t want to go on pretending. I don't want another day without you.’
He bent his head and kissed her again, not wanting to let her end it. Her mouth was so tender and
warm as she offered it to him, and he delicately played his lips across hers, lost in the passion that
burned within. It was the kiss that he had craved when he slept alone at night; when his deepest
desires would surface, and he lingered his lips as if in hope it would never fade. Harry traced his
hands along the contours of her body longingly as she slid her arms inside his jacket and un-tucked
his shirt to lay her hands against his bare skin. The feel of it sent ripples of pleasure through him,
and he gave himself over to the love he had for her, burying his guilt, knowing he would never hurt
her again.
~*~*~*~
- 219 -
Ginny had found the strength to tell Mr. and Mrs. Weasley about Harry and the threat she now lived
under with Harry’s encouragement, knowing it was the right thing to do, and Harry had insisted
they do it together now they were no longer hiding their feelings for each other. The afternoon after
the awful disquiet of Christmas Day, Harry and Ginny approached Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ron had
taken Peter out into the back garden to practice hexes, giving them the space they needed, and no
one else was expected to turn up, so they asked Ginny’s parents into the lounge room, both of them
feeling very nervous.
As Ginny explained how she and Harry had realized their feelings for each other last year, Mr. and
Mrs. Weasley had exchanged glances, and when she began stumbling towards their break up at the
end of the year, Harry took her hand, squeezing it as he brushed his thumb over her skin in an
effort to comfort her, and took over. The look on their faces as he told them about his connection to
Voldemort, and how that put Ginny’s life in danger, almost made him wish he hadn’t been so
determined to tell them. When Harry finished, the Weasleys sat in silence, side by side on the
couch, staring at Ginny.
‘So,’ Mr. Weasley said hesitantly, ‘there was a prophecy?’
‘Yes.’ Harry renewed his hold on Ginny’s hand.
‘And that's why he's after you?’
‘Partly.’ Harry had not told them the prophecy word for word, but he could see Mr. Weasley’s mind
ticking over, putting everything together. A very alarmed looking Mrs. Weasley clasped her
husband’s hand in hers tightly, her knuckles turning white.
‘And Ginny,’ he said slowly ‘he knows you have feelings for her?’
‘Yes.’ Harry watched as Mr. Weasley lifted his head slightly, swallowing his raw emotions, and
turning his gaze on his daughter. Ginny had hardly moved, hardly even breathed as she listened.
Harry could feel her fingernails digging into the flesh on his hand. Mr. Weasley dropped his eyes to
the floor.
‘Under any other circumstances, I’d be glad that my daughter chose someone such as yourself. You
are a fine young man, and I know I could trust you to treat her well,’ A gaping black hole was
stirring in Harry. He had expected this, and even worse, he agreed with it. ‘But I think the best
thing for both of you right now is to do what ever it takes to stay safe. We’ll keep a closer eye on
the house until you go back to school Harry, and then we’ll leave men here to watch Ginny and
Molly after that. I’ll try and be here as often as I can…’ but he trailed off as his eyes fell on Ginny
again.
‘No, no…’ her words were barely audible as she shook her head lightly, ‘No … I’m going back … I’m
not staying…’ Harry let go of her hand, placing it on her shoulder.
‘Your dad’s right, Gin.’
‘No Harry! Why isn’t anyone listening to me? I’m going back to Hogwarts, its no more dangerous
than staying here!’ Mrs. Weasley rose and came towards her. ‘Mum, please… if I go back, with all of
the increased security, I’ll be fine! It makes sense that I’d be better off there!’
‘You’re mother will want you here with her, Ginny.’ Mr. Weasley said ‘Surely you can understand
that?’
‘I-I do, I know why you want me to stay,’ She was looking from one to the other ‘Please, just trust
me on this; I know what I’m talking about. Hogwarts is the safest place for me … Mum?’ she
pleaded ‘Please…’ Mrs. Weasley, who had not spoken at all yet, turned her intent expression on
Arthur.
‘Well, I can see only one-way out of this.’ She said. ‘I’ll go with them when they return. I’m sure
Minerva will be able to find some empty quarters for me to stay in. I’ll be at Hogwarts as an Order
member after all, not just a mother.’ There was a sudden interruption as someone cleared their
throat.
Harry and the other three turned in the direction of the kitchen. Standing in the doorway was
probably the last person Harry had expected would turn up.
‘Hello mother.’ Percy said gravely. Mrs. Weasley let out a strangled gasp, clutching at her chest, but
she did not rush to embrace him. Mr. Weasley also stood his ground.
- 220 -
‘I didn’t mean to interrupt; Sturgis told me to … the front door was open.’ he gestured awkwardly.
‘What can we do for you?’ Even as Mr. Weasley said it, Harry could tell he was extremely
uncomfortable with having to be so formal. It seemed necessary though. The last time Percy had
appeared at their door, he had come not for his family, but to give the Minister his opportunity to
get to Harry.
‘I want to see Harry, actually.’ He said stiffly, ‘Though, he’s not the sole reason I am here.’ He still
had that pompous air about him, but Harry also thought he looked rather weary.
‘I doubt whether Harry has anything much to say that would be of any use to you, or the Ministry.’
Mr. Weasley said.
‘Well, yes … of course Harry’s an adult now.’ Said Percy, glancing in Harry’s direction. ‘Therefore I
would imagine that decision is up to him.’ Mrs. Weasley placed herself in front of her husband,
facing him.
‘He’s right Arthur. Come with me and I’ll put the kettle on, you too Ginny.’ She grabbed her hand
and led her passed Percy. She looked back at Harry questioningly as Mr. Weasley turned to him.
‘I’ll stay if you want.’
‘Its fine.’ Harry said. Mr. Weasley only gave Percy the briefest of glances as he made his way to the
kitchen.
‘Well,’ said Percy briskly ‘that went as expected.’
‘What are you doing here Percy? Still Scrimgeour's right-hand man?’
Percy tilted his head. ‘It might surprise you to learn that I was reassigned.’
‘Not really, people like you always seem to do well at the Ministry.’ Harry stated unkindly. Percy’s
eyes narrowed for a fraction of a second before he moved into the room.
‘I said reassigned, not promoted, though I see you still harbour a certain amount of resentment
towards us, even though the Minister has respected your wishes and not interfered.’
Harry kept his tone flat. ‘From what I understand, he didn’t have much of a choice after his
henchman almost killed me.’
‘Yes, yes well that was a most regrettable situation.’
‘Regrettable? See, now I wouldn’t have put it like that. Catastrophic seems rather more fitting.’
Percy tensed as he gestured to a nearby chair. ‘Why don’t we sit down?’
‘No, I don’t think so. Why don’t you just get to the reason you’re here?’
‘Very well,’ Percy said huffily, and then he leaned in and said slowly and succinctly. ‘I came here to
inform you that you can now consider the Ministry as a “safe house” if you should need it.’ Percy
raised his eyebrows and nodded, looking very pleased with himself. Harry stared at Percy in silence
for a moment.
‘What?’ He finally said, unable to stop an incredulous smile from hitting his lips.
‘It is common knowledge that Lord Voldemort is pursuing you,’ Percy said pointedly. Harry frowned
slightly at Percy’s use of the name, but he continued conspiratorially ‘and should you ever need it,
the Ministry is the place to go.’ Percy gave Harry a half-wink as if intimating some other meaning
only the two of them could share in, and Harry let out a small laugh, much to Percy’s obvious
annoyance.
‘Right. So let me just get this straight.’ Harry said pleasantly. ‘You came all the way out here to
your parents home, whom you no longer even talk to, to tell me - the person the Minister himself
almost had killed a few months ago, that I should go running to the very place I was left to die, in
the event Voldemort pops round. Is that about right?’
‘Well’ said Percy defensively, ‘When you put it like that it sounds almost comical, but-’
‘Comical?’ Harry scoffed ‘It’s completely ludicrous. Why would I return there for safety after
everything your Minister has done to help me in the past?’
‘Look, I know you’ve had your difficulties with the Ministry, but not everything is always about you!’
- 221 -
Percy said heatedly, his cool persona evaporating. ‘I’ve been working on this too, if you must know,
and something you should remember is the Ministry has the money and the resources to do things
you can not.’
Harry sighed, ‘Voldemort wont be defeated with red tape and paper shuffling by a bunch of
bureaucrats.’ Harry said, all traces of amusement gone from his voice. ‘He’s the most powerful dark
wizard that ever lived, or haven't you heard?’
Percy’s chest was heaving angrily as he spoke. ‘I had hoped you would have grown up enough to
understand. I see I was wrong. You are still as stubborn as you always were!’ He pulled something
from out of his robes and thrust it into Harry’s hands. ‘Listen to the people who are trying to talk to
you, Harry. And remember, not everything is about you.’ Then he turned and stalked out of the
room.
As the front door slammed shut, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried into the room, Ginny, Ron and Peter
trailing after them.
‘What happened?’ Mr. Weasley asked. Harry turned his gaze to the small, yet heavy clay container
in his hand. As he lifted it so he could inspect it, he saw a small hinge running along a crack, he
turned the pot, and spying a small brass latch, he opened it.
A tiny seedling was nestled in the rich, dark soil filling the container.
25. The Power Of One
Everyone had examined the seedling Percy had passed Harry with a certain amount of trepidation,
even Order members who were continually coming and going looked it over, but no one could
identify it so it was placed out in the shed, a good distance from where it could do any harm.
Ginny took to watering it everyday and positioning it into the scarce sunlight as it moved about
throughout the day in the dim surroundings, hoping that it would grow enough for them to
understand what it was. Harry accompanied her more often than not, as much to get some time
alone together as to make sure it was no threat to her.
Hermione arrived at the Burrow a week before they were to return to Hogwarts, and Ginny
immediately led her out to take a look at the seedling which had sprouted an extra tiny leaf or two
whilst she had been nurturing it. But Hermione was at a loss to explain its foliage as much as
anyone else, pointing out that it would need to be somewhat bigger before they could positively
identify it.
When Harry and Ron finally and reluctantly took her up to Harry’s room and filled her in about the
disappearance of Neville’s body, she had turned a sickly pale colour and didn’t speak for some time.
Ron moved to sit beside her on Harry’s bed, putting an arm around her in an effort to comfort her
but she seemed closed to him, as if lost in thought. Maybe the news was too much for her to
swallow, although Harry learned from Ginny that she was still receiving owls from Zach everyday,
even though he was no longer under the effects of the potion. He suspected her mood had
something to with that as well the news about Neville.
One thing that did seem to cheer Hermione was seeing Harry and Ginny together again. She learned
quickly however, to knock before she entered either Ginny’s or Harry’s room after one particularly
awkward moment where she walked in on them to find them locked together in a passionate
embrace as they laid across Ginny’s bed.
Being faced with two flushed, yet rather amused looks staring back at her, Hermione turned scarlet
and retreated rapidly, closing the door with an apologetic grin.
Whether it was the fact that Harry and Ginny seemed to be spending a lot of their spare time
together, leaving Ron and Hermione to themselves, or if Ron was feeling somewhat threatened over
Hermione’s situation with Zach, they too seemed to be spending a lot of time together.
- 222 -
For months Harry had seen their subtle, and not so subtle beginnings of a relationship forming, and
now it seemed that left to themselves, they hardly ever argued anymore. Harry caught them on
occasion wistfully watching one another when they thought the other wasn’t looking, Harry bringing
his hand to his mouth in an attempt to hide his inability to resist smirking. He and Ginny were also
often exchanging amused looks as Ron became more attentive to Hermione, uncharacteristically
thinking to hand her serving dishes of food at meal times and frequently offering to pour her tea or
juice.
The obvious change in Ron’s manners did not go unnoticed by Mr. and Mrs. Weasley either. At first,
Mrs. Weasley had fretted over Ron’s considerate attitude and had even gone so far as to place her
hand to his forehead, possibly to see if he was fevered and delirious, but it didn’t take her long to
figure out what was going on and as the days passed, she took to flashing secretive smiles to her
husband at Ron’s not so successful attempts at the oh-so casual gestures.
Harry could tell Hermione was trying to contain her pleasure at the way things were developing, and
for once he felt completely happy for them, no longer burdened with how it would effect their
friendship. He himself was feeling happier than he could remember in a long time, now that things
were out in the open for him and Ginny, and she was Ron’s little sister! If Ron and Hermione did
finally want to recognize their feelings for each other, who was he to stand in their way?
Perhaps remembering what it was like to be young and in love, Ron’s parents often retired to bed
much earlier than usual, leaving the four of them sitting by the fire at night as Peter trailed off after
them, worn out from his Defence sessions he was having daily with Harry. Once or twice Harry had
actually injured him slightly, even though he was only using simple jinxes and hexes against him.
Harry had consciously tried to restrain his skills after the first time he bruised the boy, but it was
almost as if his powers were increasing unwittingly.
But sitting by the fire after dinner was Harry’s favourite time of day. He would lounge on the couch
and freely encase Ginny in his arms as she leaned into him, resting her head on his shoulder while
Ron and Hermione would take the two-seater divan. Every night was the same. They would sit, one
at either end of the sofa, and then casually start shifting their bodies until they touched, eventually
resting against one another.
The four of them talked about everything and nothing, immersing themselves in the tranquillity of
their company, letting go of everything that plagued them during the day for those few hours at
night, knowing, yet not wanting to acknowledge it would come to an end all too soon.
Harry’s health had improved in leaps and bounds during his stay at The Burrow.
Mrs. Weasley's home cooking and the peace he rediscovered in Ginny once again had helped to
ease his mind, and he continued to take the tonic Julie had given him each night before he slipped
into bed. Socks often joined him later in the night, yet was always gone by morning. On occasion he
would see her lurking out in the yard during the day when he was training with Peter, or Ron and
Hermione, disappearing through the hedges, most probably on the hunt for mice or other cat treats.
Harry spent much of his time outside practicing new spells; some that Aberforth had taught him,
and other’s that Hermione had dug up.
At first he tried to teach Ron and Hermione a spell called the "Circumcaesura Abrogare", which was
similar to the shield charm, except the duration of the spell lasted longer and protected the caster
not only against curses and hexes, but also against other substances that might be in the
atmosphere. It was extremely advanced magic, and very powerful when cast, taking a lot of
concentration, and could prove very useful, though it had one major drawback; once it was in
action, the caster would not be able to cast spells out through the protective bubble either;
unfortunately working as a shield both ways.
Ron and Hermione found it impossible to cast it on their first session after trying for almost an hour,
so they moved onto something else which Hermione had plucked from her Inconceivable Magic:
Spells Beyond The Ridiculous book she had picked up at Flourish and Blot’s at the beginning of the
year. Needless to say, it was also extremely difficult magic. The spell was called the "Accendere
Abaqua" charm and it created fire on water.
- 223 -
Hermione melted a pool of snow for them to practice on, managing spectacularly to master it on
just her third try; though she had always been particularly adept at creating fire with magic. Harry
had eight goes at casting it before he produced a whiff of smoke that fizzled pathetically on the
water and faded into nothing, but not one to give up, on his eleventh attempt a purple flame
erupted on the reflective pool, looking almost as impressive as Hermione’s had. Ron, on the other
hand, even after over a dozen goes at it, couldn’t seem to make anything happen at all. In fact, the
melted pool of snow was starting to freeze over again by the time he eventually gave up in disgust.
So they moved onto some of the advanced hexes and curses in Hermione’s book, deciding to
practice on gnomes because they were not game to try them out on each other. Most of them had
extremely unpleasant effects that would prove difficult, if not impossible to reverse without the skills
of a talented wizard or healer. They worked out a plan. While two of them would flush out a gnome,
the other would cast the spell.
Right about now they should have been feeling rather sorry for the poor little gnomes being used in
such a way, but fortunately for the gnomes, and not the trio, they didn’t have a lot to worry about
in the end. They cast spell after spell on the unsuspecting, potatos with legs, with very little to show
for it.
One unlucky gnome limped off carrying its newly detached leg after one of Ron’s efforts, and
another had to drag it’s head along the ground awkwardly as it made its escape since it weighed
rather a lot having swelled to five times its normal size. Hermione watched it retreat, lowering her
wand guiltily as Harry stepped up for the next go.
Ron snatched up an unsuspecting, and stupidly nosy gnome by its leg as it came out of its hole to
see what all the fuss was about and waited for the nod from Harry before dropping it to the ground.
As it got to its feet angrily, brushing itself off and turning to stalk back to the bushes, Harry fired at
it. Instantly the gnome was squelched flat.
Harry stepped back stunned as Hermione let out a whimper and Ron screwed his face up, ‘Yeccch!’
‘That-that wasn’t suppose to happen!’ Harry said, still eyeing the squishy mess. ‘It was supposed to
just pin it to the ground! Not flatten it.’
‘The poor thing,’ Hermione said with a mixture of repulsion and pity.
‘But, I didn’t mean it,’ Harry said guiltily. ‘It was supposed to drop to the ground and be pinned
there, like under a heavy weight.’
‘Well, it looks like an invisible anvil dropped on it.’ Ron said with a raised eyebrow.
‘But it’s not supposed to kill it!’ Harry said persistently as he walked up to it.
‘Maybe it’s because the gnome is so small?’ Hermione said, still staring at it bleakly.
‘No!’ Harry said in frustration. ‘The spell isn’t meant to be that powerful! … I didn’t want to kill it…’
he trailed off.
‘Well … I think that’s enough for today.’ Hermione said tentatively to Harry. ‘We’ll try it again
tomorrow.’
‘Yeah, I’m hungry anyway.’ Ron said briskly.
Hermione and Harry looked at him in disbelief.
‘How could you be hungry after that?’ Hermione motioned to the sickly gooey blob where the gnome
had once stood.
‘Well I’m not going to eat that am I?’ he said as if it were self-explanatory.
~*~*~*~
The next afternoon Harry decided to do some training with Peter instead of working on new spells.
He enjoyed his time with Pete and hoped it would take his mind off the unfortunate gnome incident
from the day before.
The boy was a keen student and practiced very hard to perfect the spells Harry tried to teach him.
He led Peter to the backyard and decided to work on his shield charm, starting with something he
- 224 -
knew the boy could throw off, thinking he could gradually increase the strength of his jinxes as they
went. Peter readied himself and Harry fired off a mild hex, expecting it to bounce right off him, but
the spell broke through. The boy’s wand hand jerked suddenly and Peter let out a sudden yelp of
pain as he dropped to his knees, clutching at his arm.
Harry rushed to him and pulled back the heavy sleave of his jacket and was mortified to see that
the boy’s wand hand, right up to the elbow was blistered and raw. He quickly led Peter back
towards the house as Mrs. Weasley came rushing out looking alarmed.
As Mrs. Weasley flustered about, wrapping an arm over Peter's shoulder protectively, Harry
explained numbly that he had only cast a stinging hex while Peter’s shield was up. Once inside, Mrs.
Weasley busied herself, digging out one of her healing books and whipping up an ointment, coating
Peter’s wounds with it and then bandaging the area before shuffling the boy into the kitchen
instructing him to help himself to some freshly made hot chocolate.
When Peter was out of earshot, she turned back to Harry.
‘You threw a stinging hex at him?’ she asked cautiously.
Harry knew Mrs. Weasley had been very taken with Peter over the time he had been there, and
Peter too, seemed to reciprocate the feelings; spending much of his time helping her in the kitchen
and generally hanging around her as she fussed over him.
‘Yes,’ Harry said quietly.
‘And he was ready for it? His shield was up?’
‘Of course it was!’ Harry said defensively. ‘I wouldn’t have cast it otherwise.’
Mrs. Weasley eyed him for a moment and the side of her mouth curled slightly. ‘Well dear, it wasn’t
your fault then, was it?’ She said finally. ‘Maybe his shield charm isn’t very strong.’
Harry shook his head as he dropped his eyes to the floor. ‘No … no, that’s not it.’ He met her gaze
uneasily. ‘I’ve been working on Protego with him since the Defence classes at Hogwarts and he
withstood the same hex then.’
His eyes searched the floor at his feet again. ‘It’s not him’ he paused as the squashed gnome came
back into his mind ‘its me.’
Harry turned and left as Ron’s mum bit her lip, not knowing what to say. As he walked through the
door and down the stone steps to the front yard, Hermione called to him, coming from the side of
the house pulling her heavy quilted jacket about her against the frosty chill, Ginny in tow.
‘I placed a quick-growing charm on the seedling in the shed.’ She said as she approached. ‘I
imagine we will have a fair idea as to what the plant is not long after we get back to Hogwarts.’
‘Good’ Harry said distractedly ‘good.’
‘What?’ Ginny said flatly as she brought herself alongside Hermione, immediately picking up on his
mood. Harry looked at the both of them hesitantly.
‘I was thinking I might go back to Sirius’s.’ Ginny eyed him suspiciously as Hermione frowned.
‘We’ve only got a few days until we head back to school and there’s a few things I need to … take
care of.’
‘What things?’ Ginny said bluntly. Harry looked around the yard as he scuffed his foot in the
powdery snow.
‘I’ve been ignoring a lot of stuff over the holidays because … because I wanted a rest from it all. I
wanted to just … let it all go for a while and be with my friends.’ The people I care about, was what
he had wanted to say. He steadied himself as he finally addressed them face-to-face. ‘But I need
time alone for a while.’
~*~*~*~
- 225 -
When Harry entered number twelve Grimmauld Place, he floated his trunk up the stairs and set
Hedwig’s cage on the dresser, opening the latch so she could stretch her wings. He sat on the edge
of the bed, slumping his shoulders and closing his eyes, rubbing at them under his glasses.
What was happening to him?
He already knew from his battle in Hogsmeade that his stunning curse was gaining in strength,
having seen the trouble fully grown and powerful wizards had had keeping their feet when
deflecting it. When it had contacted its intended target, they had been flung through the air with
surprising force. He had killed a grumpy little gnome that didn’t deserve to be squashed flat, and
now he had hurt Peter, a kid who he liked immensely, with no explanation as to how it had
happened. Was he becoming dangerous in his ruthless attempts at increasing his skills?
What if he had cast something worse at Peter? The thought sickened him. How am I going to
continue training with Ron and Hermione? He thought. What if I hurt them as well? He knew Mrs.
Weasley had told them what had happened with Peter because when he had emerged with his gear
ready to leave, Ginny had pulled him aside with concern in her eyes.
‘Talk to Sir about what’s happening.’ She had said. ‘He knows your powers better than anyone. I’m
sure he’ll be able to explain it. You didn’t mean it, Harry. Pete knows that.’ Then she had leaned in
and touched his lips gently with hers. ‘We’ll see you in few days.’ Harry had nodded gravely and
glanced over at Ron and Hermione, both of who had grim expressions on their faces as they made
stunted comments that they would see him back at school, before Harry had finally turned to Pete.
‘I’m sorry about your arm.’
‘I wish I was that powerful.’ Peter had said with a wry smile, and then his expression changed.
‘You’re still going to teach aren’t you? At school I mean.’
‘Sure, but I think we’ll lay off the one-on-one sessions for a bit.’ Harry had laid his hand on the boys
shoulder. ‘I’ll see you back at Hogwarts.’ He had then thanked Mrs. Weasley for having him (which
she waved off dismissively) and left.
But now that Harry was sitting alone in the harsh dankness of the Black house, he began to wonder
whether he really should be taking the Defence classes anymore. To teach them, he had to
demonstrate spells for the students to see what they were aiming for. What if something went
wrong in class? He had been thinking about starting on the disarming spell when he got back. What
if he cast Expelliarmus and ended up sending Ron or Hermione, or one of the young students flying
backwards with such force they were knocked out, or worse?
His thoughts were interrupted by a gentle knock. Lupin’s head appeared around the door
enquiringly as Harry stayed where he sat.
‘The guard that came back with you will stay here, the rest will continue to watch The Burrow.’ He
said as he strolled into the room. ‘Why did you come back here before Hogwarts re-opens?’ he said,
taking in Harry’s demeanour. ‘There’s only a few days left, I would have thought you would have
preferred to be with the Weasley’s, especially with a certain pretty young redhead there.’ He
smirked knowingly.
Ginny. Harry thought. Maybe because of his recent contented days with her, it had been hardest to
leave her most of all. ‘I’m having some … problems with my magic.’ Harry said at last.
‘Problems?’ Lupin raised his eyebrows. ‘From what Aberforth tells me you’ve been doing
astonishingly well, I think you’re being a little hard on yourself. You have to remember you’re only
seventeen…’
‘That’s not what I mean.’ Harry said, staring in front of him. ‘I've learned a lot, and my powers are
increasing, but that is the problem.’ He looked at Lupin’s frown. ‘Things are happening that aren’t
supposed to.’ He told Lupin about the gnome and Peter’s injuries. ‘I don’t seem to be able to control
it anymore. It’s like I’ve been so obsessed with increasing my skills that they’re getting beyond me.’
‘Well, I can’t say that I’ve ever heard of this sort of thing happening before.’ Lupin said as he sat on
the bed beside Harry. ‘Normally you can increase your skill through knowledge by learning more
powerful spells, but I never thought it was possible to increase the power of mastered incantations.
They are what they are. Either you can cast them, or you can’t, with the exception of a few of the
- 226 -
more advanced castings like Patronuses.’ He gave Harry a curious look ‘Are you sure Peter was
capable of repelling a stinging hex?’
‘Yes.’ Harry said gravely as he cast his eyes to the floor. ‘I wanted to train to help people, instead’
Harry paused, reluctant to say it ‘it feels like I’m becoming a danger to them.’
Neither of them spoke for a moment as Harry continued to eye the worn out rug on the floor.
‘Well, if you’re right, and you are developing your powers beyond the normal working level,’ Lupin
finally said ‘then you need to find out what’s causing it, and discover a way of controlling it.’ Lupin
stood up and peered down at Harry. ‘I’m heading off tonight and will not be back before you return
to Hogwarts.’ Harry nodded. ‘I suggest you speak with Aberforth when you meet with him next.’
‘That’s what Ginny said.’
‘Smart girl, that one.’ Lupin smiled as Harry met his gaze. ‘Always thought so. Her OWL’s were one
of the highest levels Hogwarts has ever seen.’
‘Were they?’ Harry said in surprise. He had never even thought to enquire after her grades with so
much going on.
‘Absolutely, and considering the circumstances with which the fifth years had to sit them after last
years … events, her achievement was nothing short of astounding, far above the next closest to her,
even though all the grades were scaled up in the end. Except Ginny’s. A perfect score has never yet
been attained across the board, and had McGonagall scaled Ginny’s, she would have been the first.
Professor McGonagall was all set to award her with Hogwarts highest achievement award.’
‘She never said…’ Harry said blankly.
‘She asked the Head Mistress not to scale her results when she was called into her office earlier in
the year and informed of the schools intentions. McGonagall wasn’t keen on it, feeling she deserved
the recognition, but Ginny was very determined.’ Lupin smiled facetiously. ‘I’m certain given your
relationship with her you have been on the receiving end of her stubbornness. Eventually
McGonagall relented. Anyway, I’m off.’ Lupin said briskly. ‘Try and stay out of trouble, and don’t
worry too much, I’m sure there will be a rational explanation for your recent magical prowess.’
Lupin smiled reassuringly at Harry before leaving, closing the door behind him. Harry continued to
stare into space.
So Ginny is way more talented than she’s letting on, he thought. But why, why wouldn’t she want
the rest of them to know? Surely Mr. and Mrs. Weasley must know her results. Harry did not move
for the longest time as he sat there thinking about it. The room darkened as the sun retreated,
finally bringing Harry out of his revere. He lit the candelabra in the room and picked up the thick
candle from his bedside, igniting it before heading down to the kitchen to rustle up something for
dinner.
Over the next couple of days, The Order members who kept guard did not intrude on Harry, only
popping in a couple of times a day to check on him. Harry had grown so used to this routine that he
no longer resented it, knowing they were doing their job and even feeling grateful that he still had
their support.
Hermione contacted him more than once through their message log, but Harry didn't had a lot to
say, merely asking after them all, and finding himself relieved to hear that Peter’s arm was now free
of bandages and seemed to be healing well under Mrs. Weasley’s motherly care.
The night before he was to return to Hogwarts, Harry decide to repack his trunk so it would be
easier to navigate when back at school, and as he did so, he came across several items he had
forgotten he had even had.
The sneakascope that Ron had given him years back was still wrapped in the same horrid pair of his
uncles old socks. The presence of Scabbers no longer a problem, it whizzed no more, lying silently
where it sat. So it had worked after all, Harry thought wryly as he tucked it back into the bottom of
his trunk alongside the items he had procured from Fred and George’s Joke shop at the beginning of
last year. Once he had monotonously and rather haphazardly folded his clothing back into place,
and stowed his Firebolt on top, he lifted his parent’s dented black chest to stow it safely away.
Without knowing why, instead of putting it back in his trunk, he sat it on the bed and settled beside
- 227 -
it, pointing his wand at it and opening the lock.
He hadn’t explored the contents since opening it for the first time many months ago, and was just
lifting the yellowed parchment note from his dad to read it again when he noticed the inside panel
of the arched lid had come loose. It must have happened that awful day when Ginny had discovered
him with Julie and he dropped the chest. He pushed the panel back with his fingers in an effort to
replace it, but it sprung back, dangling open wider than before as something silvery slid into view
above the panel.
Harry slid his fingers in and eased the object out, and in uncertain disbelief, he brought it closer to
his face.
It was mirror. Not just any mirror. As he turned it over in his hand, he realized it was an exact copy
of the small oval mirror Sirius had once given him. His heartbeat quickened as his mind raced. He
placed the mirror carefully on the bed and grabbed his father’s letter, opening with shaky hands.
As he read through it slowly, he studied every word carefully.
…rest Lily,
…e home as soon as…
…merick to deliver this t…
…received news of his pla…
…will be all hands on d…
…w is my little guy do…
…bout you both, day and…
…in with Sooty to make su…
…member to use the m…
He stopped.
Parts of his father’s words were missing, parts that when he had first read them had meant little to
him. But now, glancing down at the silvery object that lay beside him, he began to piece it together.
He looked back at the letter and read on…
… will come as soon as…
…ss you my darling Lily…
…unior a hug from his da…
…y love, James
He went back to the few lines that had his heartbeat racing and read it again.
…member to use the m…
… will come as soon as…
“member to use the m…?” Had it once said, “Remember to use the mirror”? The word that was
missing from the beginning of the next sentence … could it be … was it even possible his father was
referring to Sirius? Harry swallowed hard as he picked up the mirror and held it up alongside the
parchment. He looked back and forth, from the mirror to the letter.
…member to use the m…
… will come as soon as…
Over and over he looked at the wording, and the more he read it, the more he believed in his train
of thought. Then the reality hit him. His stomach dropped painfully.
Even if this did mean that his mother had had a mirror just like the one Sirius had given him, Sirius
was gone – dead. The mirror would be useless. He slowly, reluctantly replaced the parchment in the
chest, carefully adding the mirror on top, and then closed the lid, securing the latch.
After he had finished packing, he extinguished the candelabra, leaving only the one dull candle light
on his bedside table to illuminate the room, and lay back on the top of his bed, his hands behind his
- 228 -
head as he stared up at the flaky paintwork on the ceiling. Hedwig scratched about on top of the
wardrobe, before fluttering soundlessly down to the windowsill by the bed. Harry lifted himself up
and reached across to open the window for her. She trilled gently and swooped out into the cold
night air, obviously looking forward to her nights hunt. Harry reclined again, leaving the window
open so she could come back at her leisure.
Harry tried to empty his mind, but the thoughts that plagued him would not abate.
Ever since he had arrived he had been curious as to why Ginny had been so secretive about her
abilities, and his worry over his own unexplainable increase in magical powers, along with the fact
that he had not been able to let go of the hauntingly eerie fact that Neville’s body had been stolen
had already cost him dearly in the sleep department. And now … now he had the added discomfort
of his discovery of the mirror.
The icy air that dropped through the open window stretched its tentacles out, creeping through the
room. Harry yanked off his shoes and pulled the blankets back, burying himself under the covers
still fully clothed. All of these questions, he thought. So many things that concerned him when he
knew he was supposed to be focused on only one thing: discovering what the next Horcrux was and
destroying it.
He turned over impatiently, willing the seductive plume of sleep to encase him; determined to lye
there until he fell asleep. Harry closed his eyes and tried to push everything from his mind.
How long he hovered in the state of almost sleep, he didn’t know, but something jolted him
suddenly to full consciousness. He felt it before he could even open his eyes. Clumsily he threw
himself off the bed, the blankets twisting around him as he went. He hit the floor in the small gap
between his bed and the window with a thud, grabbing urgently for his wand, which still resided in
the pocket of his jeans. Fighting the restricting sheets, an arrogant, lingering voice uttered as he
wrestled desperately.
‘Well, that is possibly one of the most amusing things I’ve seen since our last meeting.’
Harry wriggled in the narrow prison as he struggled to pull his wand out and get free of the
blankets, Snape’s drawl mocking his efforts.
‘Did you do that on purpose, or is it a frequent event?’
~*~*~*~
Harry finally managed to yank his wand free and kick the bedding off his feet. His heart was racing
as he scrambled to his feet, straightening his glasses, which were badly askew from not only falling
asleep with them on, but also from his face abruptly meeting with the floor.
Snape was standing just inside the doorway, adorned in fathomlessly black Death Eater robes,
glaring at Harry. There was no trace of the half-hearted attempts of mockery that Harry expected to
see in his expression, in fact, he looked pale and pasty and incredibly grim - even more so than
usual.
“You left us to die!” Harry blurted.
It was out of his mouth before he could even think about what he wanted to say. He had been
stewing for months over the after-effects of the spell he, Ron and Hermione had conjured on
Halloween to counter the Quintapeds, and now, faced with Snape’s sudden presence, his anger
swarmed inside him dangerously and radiating out through every single pore on his body.
Snape did not flinch. He understood exactly what Harry was referring to. He remained rigid as he
spoke.
“There was no other way to stop the onslaught.”
- 229 -
“You could have warned us!” Harry jerked his wand as he spoke. “Instead, you left us completely
vulnerable!” His chest was heaving as his knuckles whitened over his wand. “But I guess that’s
exactly what you wanted, wasn’t it?”
Not taking his eyes off Snape, who had his wand aimed uncharacteristically casually in his direction,
Harry edged out from behind the bed, scuffing the blankets under foot in an effort not to trip over
them.
“And what meandering path of wisdom brought you to that logical conclusion?” Snape drawled as he
followed Harry’s movements with his wand.
“You set us up.” Harry’s skin was tingling and burning with violent fury. He rounded the bed and
stopped in front of it. “You neglected to tell me that we’d be useless to defend ourselves in the
aftermath. You used us to do your dirty for you, knowing you were landing Bellatrix in hot water for
her failure, and then hoping we’d be wiped out by her wrath-”
“As always, your powers for deduction are nothing short of – astonishing.” Snape’s sarcasm
glowered as he raised an eyebrow. “Explain to me why I would want to destroy both Bellatrix
LeStrange and the great Harry Potter? Surely even you had trouble piecing that together and
making it stick?”
“You’ve always hated me.” Harry said with no trace of bitterness. His voice was dark and controlled.
“It’s not that hard to imagine you wanting me dead – especially after you killed Dumbledore.”
Snape winced slightly. “And you at least pretended to tolerate him.”
A change had come over Snape at the mention of Dumbledore. His shoulders, usually stiff and
ready, slumped forward marginally, and his skin seemed to drain of the shadow of natural colour it
barely contained, leaving him pallid and ghostly looking. Harry might have thought he looked
almost remorseful – if he didn’t know better.
“Dumbledore knew what could happen – what would happen.” Snape said, not meeting Harry’s
eyes.
“What?” Harry’s anger was rapidly morphing into pure fury. “You evil…” The name Harry tagged
Snape with at this point was so shockingly corse that Snape’s eyes immediately snapped back to
him. “He trusted you! He believed in you when no one else would have given you the time of day!
And how did you repay him? You killed him in cold blood when he was sick enough to probably be
dying already!”
Snape’s jaw set as he spoke scathingly. “It would pay you not to be so presumptuous. My-”
“I know more than you think!” Harry unconsciously advanced, stopping after his first step as he
realized his closeness to his hated ex-professor, and making Snape renew his grip on his wand.
“You managed to slime your way into Dumbledore’s confidence by turning on Voldemort. But I was
there! I was there that night on the tower. I saw you kill Dumbledore - minutes after he asked me
to find you so you could help him!” Harry held back the maddening, bitter tears that stung his eyes,
infuriated at the thoughts of breaking down in front of Snape.
“You even had a hand in Sirius’s death because you let your pathetic pride interfere with our
Occlumency sessions, letting me see exactly what Voldemort wanted me to see. And somehow, you
conveniently didn't act fast enough the night he died, either. Strange how it took so long for the
Order to arrive.”
“I did what I could.” Snape injected calmly. “If you had done as you were-”
“You started all of this!" Harry cut him off, advancing again as his hatred pulsed uncontrollably, his
voice growing higher as he spoke. "You went running to your master after hearing part of the
Prophecy. You’re the one who’s responsible for Voldemort’s unrelenting vendetta against me! You’re
the one who is responsible for my parents deaths!”
Harry seethed dangerously as he stopped only feet away from Snape. They were standing face to
face, wands aligned and running parallel, yet pointed in opposite directions. Snape looked like he
- 230 -
was going to be sick there and then. Harry glared at him, overwhelmed by the need to do
something to Snape. Guilt. So close now, Harry could see it in Snape’s face. But it was indefinable
guilt. It was impossible to think that Snape felt the deep and painful regret of his wrongdoing that
seemed to be etched across his features.
“Dumbledore told you.” Snape's words weren’t so much a question, more a grim statement, uttered
in a strangled voice.
“No – he didn’t. Though he should have. He would never have betrayed you like that.” The sourness
of Harry’s words registered on Snape’s face. “He insisted that you were to be trusted. He said he
had an ‘iron-clad’ reason for believing in you – and you killed him.”
Snape’s eyes were shadowed as he spoke.
“I never liked your father,”
Harry gaped at Snape. His mind raced in an effort to come up with the most horrible of the new
curses he had practiced over the Christmas break.
“But your mother ... loved him.” Snape screwed up his face in distaste; the word ‘loved’ rolling off
his tongue like a brick. “And I would never have wished her any harm.”
Harry was pulled out of his mental checklist. “What?”
“Your mother, Lily” Snape turned his gaze from Harry “was my potions partner in my NEWT years at
Hogwarts.” Snape lowered his wand a fraction as his gaze settled on Harry’s bewildered one. “She
was – a good person. Too good for likes of James Potter. But she saw something in him he must
have kept exceedingly well hidden from most. I was forced to believe that he must have had some
redeeming qualities because I knew her. She was no fool.”
Harry stared dumbfounded. This was too much to take in! He knew his mother was gifted at potions
from what Slughorn had said, but he never thought of her having a connection to Severus Snape;
especially given he had seen the memory in the pensieve. She had made an effort to intervene
when his father had had Snape humiliatingly dangling upside-down with his underwear on display to
the whole school, but his scathing refusal of her help, and her subsequent reluctant giggle when his
father had jumped to her defence had made him believe there was no love lost between his mother
and Snape. It had never occurred to him that they would have been thrown together and actually
developed some kind of – friendship?
“You … my mother?”
Snape was eyeing Harry under half-closed lids. His expression unreadable.
“She was an extraordinary woman.” Snape said, a flicker of – was it – fondness? Crossing his face.
“We would have remained friends if it wasn’t for her – devotion – to James.”
Harry stalled for a moment, trying desperately to absorb this unwanted information. If this was
true, if Snape was really ‘friends’ with his mother, then that complicated everything Harry thought
to be true. They had worked together as partners – mixing, measuring, stiring, talking, and maybe
even laughing? A repugnant and irrational – decidedly irrational - fear came out of the blue and was
slowly uncoiling in the pit of Harry’s stomach.
“You…” Harry was beginning to feel sick at the thought that was pressing in on him. “You … and my
mother…” He said slowly.
Snape raised an eyebrow.
Harry felt like he almost couldn’t breathe. “You weren’t…” His train of thought that ran along the
lines of somewhere Harry thought he would never have to go must have shown, because Snape cut
in abruptly.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter! Your mother and I were only ever potions partners.”
- 231 -
Harry was suddenly awash with relief. Snape appeared irritated, disgusted, and … faintly amused.
“But in those two years I grew to respect her, though it pains me to admit to you. Believe me.”
Snape’s tone ruffled Harry’s ire again as he swallowed the bile that had been creeping up at the
thoughts of his mother and Snape being … lovers. “How could you have told Voldemort-”
“I didn’t know!” Snape snapped. “Since you know so much, you should be aware I only heard part
of the Prophecy. I had no idea your mother was pregnant at the time. We hadn’t spoken since we
graduated.” Did Snape actually look regretful? “We both walked very separate paths after that…” He
sounded extremely weary as he trailed off.
“So you’re washing your hands clean then?” Harry said grievously. “Blood doesn’t come off that
easily, Snape!” Snape sucked in a deep breath. “You would have known he was going after my
family, wouldn’t you? And you let them die anyway.”
“I did try to stop it from happening. When I found out-”
“I DON’T WANT TO HEAR IT!” Harry roared. Snape stood his ground and kept his wand low.
“Nothing you can say will change everything that’s happened!”
“Of course it won’t!” Snape said icily. “But its inevitable we play out this charming little scenario
before its too late!”
“Too late for what?” Harry shouted.
“For you to realize who your allies are!” Snape said steadily.
Harry stared a Snape for a moment.
“Oh,” Harry said slowly. “I get it. You’re going to try to do to me what you did to Dumbledore.
You’re going to try and tell me you’re really on my side, aren’t you?” He sneered at the thought.
Snape narrowed his eyes. “Need I waste my breath?”
Harry scoffed. “How stupid do you really think I am? – On second thoughts - don’t answer that! I
already know. Otherwise you wouldn’t be here.”
Snape’s shoulders dropped as he breathed out heavily. “I’m not doing this under the delusion that
we can ever trust in one another. That would be fool-hardy to say the least, given our history.”
Snape eyed Harry’s wand. “I would appreciate it if you would lower that somewhat, however. It
might go off accidentally – given your disposition.”
“Its not accidentally you should be worried about.” Harry said. Nothing Snape could say would
change the fact that he had been the one to tell Voldemort about the Prophecy. There was no
absolution for his betrayal of Dumbledore. Yet Harry found himself relaxing his arm anyway. His
mother had seen something Snape, something that Harry couldn’t, maybe just like Snape with
James.
“Thank you.” Snape said.
“Don’t thank me yet.”
“You have too much confidence in your abilities, Potter.”
“Are you going to tell me why you are here, or not?” Harry said, his anger and hatred holding under
a very fine leash.
“Yes. But as I don’t have time to give you all the answers you seek,” Snape said as he relaxed his
own grip on his wand further “you will have to go back to what you once knew.” At Harry’s frown,
Snape continued. “You always had faith in Dumbledore. Dumbledore had faith in me. You will need
- 232 -
to utilize that to get to the next Horcrux.”
Harry froze. He stared at Snape dumbly.
“Surprised?” Snape asked.
“Not really.” Harry rushed, recovering as quickly as he could. “Voldemort knows I’m after them. He
probably told you as you’re one of his ‘most trusted servants’ – in fact he probably sent you here-”
“Do not assume to second guess what Voldemort is thinking, or doing!” Snape cut in angrily. “He
trusts no one! He sends out clueless individuals under the guise that they are redeeming
themselves, knowing that they will do whatever it takes to keep their family safe.” Harry frowned
again. Snape rolled his eyes. “I am, of course, speaking of Mr. Malfoy.”
“Lucius is not what I’d call ‘clueless’. He’s-”
“I’m not talking about Lucius, you twit! I’m talking about his son!”
“Draco?”
“Yes.”
“So,” Harry’s mind raced. “He’s looking for a Horcrux? At Hogwarts?”
“Yes, and no.” Snape said grimly. “He’s had no idea why he’s been looking for the object assigned,
he’s only trying to prevent his father from being murdered – as his mother was.”
A dull ache surged from the pit of Harry’s stomach. Draco Malfoy was far from his favourite person
in the world, but he couldn’t help empathizing with him when it came to losing his mum and dad –
however horrible they were.
He thought Draco Malfoy had looked somewhat thinner the last time he'd seen him. Even in the
strange black light of the Lumo Sepia charm, his pale grey eyes had look haunted, and his cheeks
hollow. It was obvious he was still struggling. Lucius too, had looked thin. Maybe from his stay in
Azkaban. Even though it was no longer guarded by dementors, it still couldn't have been pleasant.
Not that Lucius Malfoy deserved pleasant. He had gloated over Harry’s incompetence and almost let
something slip, but Draco had stepped in. It was automatic – the way he had reined in his father.
Protective even.
“What do you mean, yes and no?” Harry asked, trying to focus on the Horcruxes.
“I mean, that what Draco Malfoy has been sent to find may – or may not – be a Horcrux.” Snape
was holding Harry’s gaze meaningfully. “The true dilemma he faces is finding it. The Dark Lord is
growing impatient. He is ready to … remove Draco and send in others.”
Harry knew immediately what Snape meant by ‘remove’. “Others?”
“Others who would not think twice about killing anyone that discovered them. Including children.”
Harry swallowed.
“I think you will agree that that particular situation would be best avoided.” Something flashed
across Snape’s expression, but it was gone before Harry could get a handle on it.
“Why did he send Draco in the first place?” Harry asked suspiciously. “Its not like he did a
magnificent job the last time, is it?” Harry bit down on the venomous remark that sat on his tongue
about Snape’s involvement.
Snape seemed to pick up on his restraint. “You are aware Draco is not a killer. That does not mean
he cannot be of use to the Dark Lord – for a time. But his time is rapidly running out. He needs your
help.”
- 233 -
Harry spluttered a disbelieving cough.
“You’re joking!” He couldn’t stop the incredulous smile from hitting his lips. “You’re asking me to
help Draco Malfoy find a Horcrux so he can return it to Voldemort?”
“No.” Snape said coolly, chosing his words carefully. “I’m telling you that if you do not help Mr.
Malfoy find what he is looking for, then both he, and his father, are dead." Snape tilted his head as
he played his card. "Though who would have to watch whom die, I cannot say.”
Harry was beginning to feel nauseas. He could honestly say that he couldn’t care less if Voldemort
decided to send Lucius off in a halo of green light. But Draco – he didn’t deserve that. Nor did he
deserve to have his father’s death on his conscience.
“I can’t.” Harry said with difficulty. The first time he and Draco met in Hagrid's hut, Harry had seen
that Draco had his mother’s death weighing on him - bending him to the point of breaking. Harry
suspected that his father’s death would shatter him completely. “I can’t do that. I can’t hand over a
Horcrux to Voldemort.” Harry’s voice cracked as he spoke.
Snape’s expression didn’t move, as if he had expected Harry's answer. Harry met his gaze, battling
with himself over his feelings of guilt.
Snape’s eyes grew hard.
A strange muzzy feeling encroached on Harry, something like an invisible hand reaching into his
mind, easing in, and then pushing in – intent on seeking and probing.
Harry felt a shift in his thoughts; an image was struggling to appear. It was like a page in a
scrapbook, sticky with sloppy glue, being plied open.
No!
He knew this feeling, but he had never been able to recognize it so quickly and prevent the barrage
of mental slides – memories in pieces - surfacing at the urge of another. Harry pulled on an empty,
dark space in his mind as he resisted Snapes intrusion, a black hole of nothingness, and swiftly
settled there.
“Get out of my head!” Harry yelled. A second later, the push was gone.
Snape was standing before Harry, eyeing him curiously.
“Don’t do that!” Harry said, angered by Snape’s attempted invasion.
“You closed your mind.” Snape said frowning. “Very efficiently too. Strange considering where you
were a few months ago.”
“A lot of things have changed.” Harry said defiantly, remembering his surges in power. He tried to
keep his tone level, unwilling for Snape to realize that Harry was as surprised by his ability to shut
out Snape as Snape was.
Snape seemed to be thinking to himself, and then he nodded his head briefly.
“Unexpected. This is something I hadn’t dare count on," he glanced back to Harry "knowing your
previous endeavours.” He added insultingly. He still couldn’t resist a poke at Harry, even through
this unlikely truce. Snape was weighing something up in his mind, and then he straightened and
drew breath. “You will help Draco, and you will allow him to take the item to Voldemort because it is
not a Horcrux.”
“What? ... But you just said-”
“Don’t argue with me - I’m running out of time and patience for this bantering!” Snape’s voice
returned to his usual tone in the classroom. “Draco will need your help in getting into the
Headmaster’s office. He will also require access to the pensieve.”
- 234 -
“Er... ” Harry stared blankly, utterly bereft of any power to reason out what Snape was saying.
Snape sighed exaggeratedly. “I see your verbal skills haven’t improved.” Then very slowly, as if
talking to the temporarily deaf, he continued. “Get Draco into the Head Office. There you will find
the information you both require to go further.”
“Hang on” Harry said, remembering something. “Malfoy has already been in the Head Office. Over
the summer break.”
Snape narrowed his glare. “How do you know that?”
“Why didn’t he get the information he needed then?” Harry asked, ignoring Snape.
Snape narrowed his eyes suspiciously, but he did not pursue the matter - perhaps because he was,
indeed, running out of time.
“Because neither of you were ready before now. The information would have brought about not only
his demise, but other's as well. Not to mention most likely yours.”
Harry raised an eyebrow in cynical disbelief. “Concerned for my welfare?”
“When it is tied to Draco Malfoy's – yes.”
“How did he get-”
“I will be missed." Snape cut in impatiently. "The password to access the cabinet is…” Snape paused
and wrinkled his nose. “Lollygobble.” He looked like something particularly nasty had wafted under
his nose. “You will need to disband the silencing charm surrounding the cabinet before you use the
password. Draco will know how.”
“I know how to cancel a simple silencing charm!” Harry was stupidly irritated at Snape’s continued
inference that he was a useless wizard.
“Being child’s play, I would hope so.” Snape drawled. “But this is no ordinary silencing charm.”
“Why does Draco even need my help?”
“For one – he does not have the password – not to the Heads office, or the cabinet. In fact, he isn’t
aware he needs one to gain access to the pensieve. Also, he will need you specifically to locate the
item – if I am correct.”
“How do I know he wont try to attack me when my back is turned?” Harry's old rivalry surfaced. He
felt quietly confident at a duel with Malfoy, but if he let his guard down enough to do this, he
doubted Draco would allow him the opportunity of fighting back, if he decided to turn on Harry.
Snape sighed. “Has he pursued you even once in the whole time he’s been in and out of Hogwarts?”
Harry thought about it, and then frowned.
“Well … no.”
“Am I right in saying then, that the two times you came in contact with him was when you were
pursuing him?”
“I. Well. I…”
“Precisely.” Snape sneered slightly. “You would do well to keep that in mind, Potter. Draco Malfoy is
walking a thin line, and under much duress. He could still fall either way. But remember – he has
posed no threat to anyone at Hogwarts this year. I must leave.” He paused just as he was about to
turn and considered Harry. “I hope we can forego any of the unnecessary parting rituals we have
become accustomed to of late.”
- 235 -
Harry stared at Snape, registering a great weariness lurking in him. He nodded once.
Snape looked mildly surprised, then turned to leave.
“I do have a question for you though. Well, a couple actually.”
Snape sighed impatiently and turned to face him.
“Firstly – How am I going to help Malfoy if I don’t even know where he is?”
“He will find you.”
“Oh.” This was somewhat unsettling. The thoughts that Draco could track him down so easily hadn’t
really occurred to him before. He had always been concerned with the safety of the other students
at the school. Harry barged on before he could re-think himself.
“Why did you kill Dumbledore?”
Snape stiffened. His eyes shuttered and he appeared completely closed.
“The answer to that will present itself when you are not seeking it.”
Harry hated these cryptic answers. Absolutely hated them - having had more than his fair share of
them over the years. Snape was almost beginning to sound like Dumbledore.
“How can I believe anything you’ve said?” There was no malice in his question, just a great deal of
his own weariness.
Snape answered bleakly.
“When the time is right, inform Miss. Granger and Mr. Weasley that, under the circumstances, I do
not consider they owe me a life debt.”
And with that, Snape was gone.
26. Uncovering Draco Malfoy - Part 1
The cloak of night reluctantly receded.
Shadows stretched and thinned under dawn’s bloody glow as it encroached on the ancient,
crumbling stonework that perched on the rocky drop-off. The wild grass that tufted through the
salt-burned snow at the foot of weary walls was blonde and brittle and dead. The trees that rimmed
the Dark Forest gripped the edge of the rugged and relentlessly weathered cliffs, leaning heavily
over the exposed expanse burdened not by too much snow, but by the presence of what lay hidden
within their depths.
Beneath the rubble of what was left of the old castle, in the bowls of a long forgotten fortress, two
figures waited. One sat hidden by an emerald swathed winged backed chair edged with blackened
steel serpents that appeared frozen in mid-writhe. The other stood tall and dark and rigid just inside
the damp stone archway that led into the dreary chamber.
“You have seen the boy?”
A voice like ice and daggers rose from the chair.
“Yes, my Lord.” Snape bowed his head even though he could not be seen.
- 236 -
“And.” Said more as a warning than a question.
“He will do as expected.”
“And the other?”
“She will be ours in a matter of days.”
The waves that bombarded and crashed against the jagged cliff face somewhere behind the walls of
the underground chamber hummed their fury through the room.
“The dragon whelp will be brought to me before the full moon.” The order was laced with
displeasure. “Lucius will have the opportunity to make amends for his … mistakes.” The last word
hissed out evilly.
“Yes, my Lord.”
Snape stayed in his half-bow, waiting. Finally, like shards of glass, the voice shattered the silence.
“Do you think I am being too harsh on him?” the voice asked silkily.
“Young Malfoy is of no consequence, my Lord.”
A malevolent chuckle followed. “You betray your feelings, Severus. I was referring to Lucius.”
The silence that followed unsettled the very air between the two. A scaly white hand that had rested
lightly on the snakehead arm of the chair motioned casually.
“Come. Stand before me, Severus. Let me see you.”
Snape instantly glided across the room, his black robes swirling behind him. In one swift easy
movement, head bowed, he lowered himself on one knee, lacing his hands across the other raised
knee, and subjugated himself at the foot of Lord Voldemort.
Long white fingers ending in unnatural, talon-like nails came to rest under Snape’s chin.
“You are such a contradiction.” Voldemort mused almost fondly. “So eagerly you betray trusted
companions to their deaths, yet you are willing to suffer the incompetence of an imp.”
The fingers gently forced Snape to raise his gaze to meet the two red, reptilian eyes that studied
him.
“Could it be that you love Draco, Severus?”
Snape said unflinchingly. “I would tear the last breath from him if you wished it, my Lord.”
With the removal of the hand, Snape lowered his head once more.
~*~*~*~*~
“Where’s Hermione?”
It was a question Harry had heard more times in the last week than anyone needed to hear in a
lifetime.
“I don’t know.” Harry sighed. “I’ve been with you all evening. Why are you asking me?”
Ron scratched something out on the parchment he had sprawled in his lap and screwed his nose up
in frustration.
- 237 -
“I need her.” He said matter-of-factly. “How am I supposed to know why the Dicta charms require
swishes and not flicks? I can’t finish this ludicrously long essay if she’s not around.” He looked up at
Harry with a slight worry crease between his eyebrows. “Where does she keep disappearing off to,
anyway? Ever since we got back I’ve hardly seen her.”
“We’re talking about Hermione, Ron” Harry said, sounding exasperated. “Its NEWT year.”
“Yeah. But that doesn’t explain why she’s not here studying with us, does it?” He turned back to his
parchment and scribbled something down and added sulkily. “She always studies with us.”
Harry rolled up his transfiguration homework with a frown, giving up completely on being able to
concentrate. At the beginning of the week, Ron and Hermione (mostly Hermione - Ron having been
reluctantly recruited) had cornered Harry and admonished that he needed to start catching up on
his schoolwork since the year was already half over. (After all, if Harry wanted any kind of shot at
being an auror he ought to buckle down every free moment he had.) Harry had tried to put the
effort in, but even though potions classes had been suspended until the replacement professor
arrived on Monday, giving them all more free time, and every night this week he had his nose
buried in a book with a concentrated look on his face, instead of absorbing and understanding and
writing about the information in front of him, his mind hadn’t taken in a word of it. He found he had
too many things going on inside his head. Things that were pressing and couldn't wait.
Not the least of which was that the three of them seemed to have hit a brick wall in uncovering the
identity of the unknown Horcrux.
Harry was almost certain Hermione was using some of the time she spent hidden away researching
what the item could be. Yet so far, she had not, as was her usual want, come bounding up to Harry
and Ron loaded with the latest brilliant epiphany that would set them all on the right track again. He
had tried to pin her down to discussing it with him on several occasions, but Hermione had taken to
making fumbling excuses, shooting Harry pained or nervous glances as she invariably made her
exit. Not like Hermione at all. She should have been huddled in whispered conversation with Harry
and Ron at every opportune moment. But she wasn’t. In fact, Harry was beginning to get the
distinct impression that Hermione had been avoiding him.
Harry stuffed his books and papers in his already overfilled bag that leant against the foot of his
chair.
“I’m going for some air.”
Ron looked up, the crushed end of his quill tip hovering near his mouth. “If you see Hermione, tell
her it’s getting late, will you?” Harry nodded. “Do you want me to do the rounds for you?”
Harry smiled reassuringly and stood up. “Its fine. I’ll do it on the way back.”
“You going to the lake?”
“Yeah.” Harry threw his bag over his shoulder and climbed the dormitory stairs to drop off his
books, retrieve some warmer clothing and don his invisibility cloak. Ron didn’t quiz Harry as to why
he was headed to the lake again, or offer to come along. For which Harry was glad. His best friend
seemed quite happy to give him the room he needed. Something Hermione never really quite got
the hang of – until recently that is.
When Harry emerged back in the common room, thanks to his trusty cloak, no eyes were on him as
he crossed the room unseen and crawled through the portrait hole to make his way along the
deserted halls.
The time spent away from Hogwarts at Christmas, had brought into sharp belief just how often the
other students spent covertly eyeing Harry. He found himself keenly aware of the hands that
shaded whispering mouths, the swing of heads that turned quickly away when his eyes roamed a
room, and worst of all, the expectant, doey eyes of the younger students who not so much as
looked at him, but to him. For what, Harry knew all to well, and he found it disconcerting, to say the
least.
- 238 -
Harry stopped momentarily as he walked across the grounds and cast a cautious warming charm on
himself. He had spoken to Sir at their first meeting when he had returned to Hogwarts and
explained the problems he’d been having with his magic. Sir had looked troubled to begin with, and
remained silent for some time before offering the explanation that Harry’s magic was ‘spiking’, and
that it was most likely to do with the new, more powerful spells he’d been practising.
After the first session, (and several incidents of near misses with unexpected effects) Sir cautioned
Harry, telling him that he needed to rein in his emotions. The problems appeared to surface mostly
when Harry was overly emotive, and then again nearer the end of the lesson, when he was worn
out. It was up to Harry, Sir said, to keep control of his feelings, and by so doing, control the spikes.
When Harry reached the small jetty overhanging the lake, he removed his father’s cloak and
perched himself on the edge of the pier, dangling his legs above the waters edge. This was the
fourth night in a row (bar the night before last when it had poured torrential rain on the castle) that
he had sat in this spot. It was a nice spot to sit. Something about the lazy ripples of the black water
was incredibly calming, giving Harry a chance to churn his thoughts uninterrupted.
It also gave Malfoy the perfect opportunity to approach Harry. Which still hadn’t happened.
Harry was growing increasingly restless. He glanced over his shoulder, and then looked back out
over the spangled surface of the lake.
It had been almost a week since the return of school, and he was beginning to wonder if Malfoy was
ever going to make himself known. Harry was tired of waiting for something to happen. The
anticipation was wearing on him. It was almost tempting to just give up on this uncomfortable quest
of Snape’s and forget completely about any trouble Malfoy may have landed himself him. To be
honest, Harry wasn’t entirely sure if Malfoy didn’t deserve all he might get. He had always been
excessively vicious to Harry and his friends. Ever since day one. Really, what did Harry care if
Malfoy’s nasty disposition and narrow-minded prejudices were about to ricochet back onto him? You
reap what you sow. Right?
There was the slight problem however, that according to Snape, Harry was going to need Malfoy to
get to the next Horcrux.
Harry breathed out loudly and shifted in his spot.
He hadn’t quite managed to come to terms with Snape’s revelation about his friendship with his
mother. In a way, maybe it wasn’t as shocking as perhaps he would have expected months ago. It
was more the fact that Harry didn’t want to believe it.
From what Lupin had told him about Lily, she was the kind of person who would befriend the un-
befriendable. Until recently, Harry had never been in doubt that underneath Snape’s cold, oily and
decidedly ugly exterior, he harboured just as much icy disgust, greasy bitterness, and unattractive
hatred as he reflected outwardly.
But then, he had gone and given Harry the means to prevent Bellatrix from destroying Hogsmeade -
and he had saved Ron and Hermione. That had to count for something. So now Harry was finding
himself reluctantly believing that there might actually be more to Snape than the loathsome Death
Eater.
Yet Harry couldn’t quite trust him. Maybe it came down to all the years of their mutual loathing.
Something like that couldn’t be erased in a matter of weeks or months even, let alone days. In the
end, his instincts kept him wary.
Harry picked up one of the small pebbles that littered the jetty and tossed it into the lake
impatiently.
Why hadn’t Malfoy accosted him yet? There was still one more Horcrux before Harry could leave
Hogwarts in search of Nagini and Riddle. The unknown Horcrux. The Horcrux that Voldemort is
apparently trying to re-acquire from Hogwarts, and yet Snape says isn’t a Horcrux at all. How could
Voldemort not know what all of his Horcruxes were? Snape was either wrong, or he was lying just
- 239 -
so Harry would hand it over to Malfoy. Either way, it still meant the item must be a Horcrux. There
was no logical reason why Voldemort would send Malfoy in on a wild goose chase, and therefore,
there was no way Harry was going to hand his prize over to Draco Malfoy once it was in his
possession.
But he needed the Slytherin to acquire it since Malfoy knew the way passed the pensieves silencing
ward and Harry did not. Though, thinking about it, if he spoke to McGonagall, maybe she might be
able to disarm it. After all, she was the Headmistress now, and she was also about as close to
Dumbledore as anyone could have been. Its not like he had to keep it a secret from her anymore.
She knows about the Horcruxes now.
…Yes.
Yes. It was less risky and all together a much more comforting thought to work with McGonagall
than Malfoy. So he would speak to McGonagall and she was sure to help. That way he could by-pass
his long time schoolyard enemy completely.
But then…
He would essentially be leaving the other boy to his fate. In fact, Harry was as good as holding the
wand that would send the killing curse that would take the breath from Draco Malfoy.
Harry let out a frustrated sigh.
He sat there for some time, pondering his many thoughts by the lake, hoping - yet dreading -
Malfoy would show. Eventually, Harry picked himself up, throwing the cloak over his head, and
made his way back to the castle.
He couldn’t keep waiting for Malfoy to appear. He had to get into that pensieve as soon as possible.
He would have to approach McGonagall in the morning. Tomorrow was Saturday, that would give
them both plenty of time to work on getting into the pensieve.
Harry eased open the heavy front doors and slipped quietly into the entrance hall. It was late. Much
later than he had realised, and he still had to do his Head Boy rounds. Deciding to start in the
dungeons and work his way up, he headed over to the stairs and trudged down them, thinking they
wouldn’t take long to do as most of the area was deserted now the Slytherins no longer resided
there and Slughorn was still catatonic in St Mungos.
He strolled along the familiar corridors, occasionally checking doors whilst keeping an eye out for
anything out of place. He did not bother to remove his invisibility cloak as it shielded him against
the penetrating dampness that clung to the dungeons, and prevented the usual exchanging of
unpleasantries with Filch if he should happen by the old caretaker or his eerie cat. He passed by
portraits and tapestries, and blank wall, descending more stairs in the underground passageways,
working his way along steadily through torchlight and shadow, and then stopped suddenly.
He cocked his head and listened. Nothing.
Harry looked up ahead of him, and then turned to search the area behind him, but could see
nothing but the empty corridor in both directions.
Then faint scuffing sounds drifted down the stairs behind him. Harry watched from where he stood,
but no one appeared at the bottom.
Harry drew his wand and pushed his back against the wall. He was still not able to see anyone, but
the person was most definitely in the corridor with him now. It wasn’t an Order member patrolling
the castle; Harry had stumbled on them often enough in his Head Boy travels to know they did not
use invisibility cloaks inside.
Suddenly, the scuff of a shoe on stone sounded impossibly close.
Harry held his breath.
- 240 -
A voice whispered near his ear, and then Harry was falling backwards.
The sound of stone scraping against stone covered Harry’s 'oof' as he hit the floor. He lay there for
a stunned second, watching the wall close in front of him, and then frantically pulled his feet up to
make sure they weren’t poking out of the cloak, which mercifully, had clung to him as he fell.
A quick glance around, and he instantly recognised his surroundings. The Slytherin common room.
It had been years since he had been there with Ron, but it was immediately recognisable. The
House colours of green and silver overwhelmed the area, broken only rarely by the stray, dark
colouring of expensive hardwoods, or the golden glow of a lit torch.
His eyes were drawn to a door that suddenly opened seemingly of its own accord and then closed
again.
Harry got to his feet carefully, wand still grasped in hand, adjusting his cloak as he went. No one
was supposed to have access to old common rooms. It was one of the first things McGonagall had
explained to Harry when she went over his duties. They were locked, she said, closed off so that the
students wouldn’t be tempted to try returning to them. It also lessoned the area needing to be
patrolled.
Yet here Harry was, standing in the obviously inhabited dormitory, eyeing the door that someone
had just passed through.
He wanted to open it. But if he just burst through it, whoever it was might be right on the other
side, or worse, still in the room with him, then he’d give himself away, and that could lead to all
sorts of problems, especially as his magic was unpredictable at the moment. Whoever it was
definitely shouldn’t be here. Actually, Harry had a fairly good idea who the ownerless footsteps
belonged to, but what they were doing had his curiosity piqued.
He really wanted to open the door and follow, and had made up his mind to risk it when the door
opened again and Draco Malfoy walked into the room.
Harry fought the instinct to whip off his cloak and confront Malfoy then and there, choosing to stay
hidden instead. Maybe it was because Malfoy had such an intense look on his face as he was
walking to the fireplace, like he was on important business.
Harry watched quietly as the boy pushed the coffee table away from the front of the fireplace and
began pulling cushions off the chairs and couches, throwing them onto the floor at his feet. Well.
No. That wasn’t quite accurate. He was placing them – rather meticulously – in a solid circle on the
threadbare rug.
When he was contented with the layout of the cushions, Malfoy yanked a white pillowslip out of his
cloak pocket and laid it on the table behind him. He slid his cloak off and folded it neatly over a
green leather armchair and then grabbed the bottom of his fleecy jumper and pulled it off over his
head, mussing up his silver blonde hair so it uncharacteristically stuck out in all directions. He folded
the jumper just as carefully as he had the cloak, and then raked his fingers through his hair,
smoothing it down before moving onto the cuff of his shirt.
Harry could tell by Malfoy’s actions that all of this was a well-practised routine, and it made him
wonder just how long the Slytherin had been residing in the common room undetected.
Harry was just thinking to himself that if Malfoy was going to sleep in the buff then he would have
to reveal himself, and soon, when Malfoy did something wholly unexpected. Instead of moving onto
the right cuff to remove his shirt altogether, he rolled up the sleave of his left arm.
Harry sucked in a breath.
The Dark Mark stood out stark and aggressive against the pale skin beneath it.
The Slytherin reached behind him and picked up the pillowcase. He slowly began twisting it tightly,
round and round, until it was a solid roll of fabric between his hands. Harry wondered what this
bizarre ritual was leading up to, but Malfoy was facing away, towards the fireplace leaving Harry
- 241 -
unable to make out the Slytherins expression.
So he moved closer.
As he neared, Harry’s eyes were drawn to the Mark, the skin surrounding which was yellowed and
purpled indicating both new and old bruising. As his gaze wandered up, he took in the tension in the
blonde’s arms and the stiff stance of his shoulders. Malfoy’s jaw was moving as he ground his teeth
together, and Harry was taken aback at the unguarded, haunted look of the Slytherins darkly
encircled eyes. The boy’s breathing was coming in quick, expectant pants as he wiped the light
beading of sweat off his brow with a slight tremble in his hand.
Harry swallowed.
Raw fear was radiating from the Slytherin.
Malfoy dropped to his knees on the cushions. He drew several long, deep breaths before placing the
white cloth between his teeth and wrapping it around the back of his head, tying it off with a sharp
tug. He then brought his right palm up over the Dark Mark and bowed his head.
And there he stayed, not moving except for the steady rise and fall of his shoulders as he breathed
slowly in and out through his nose.
Harry glanced at the fireplace, but it showed no signs of life, so he watched Malfoy, both bewildered
and fascinated.
The only sound in the room aside from Malfoy’s sharp breaths was coming from a Grandfather clock
steadily tick-tocking somewhere behind Harry. Suddenly Harry was startled out of his voyeurism by
its melodic chime signalling the midnight hour. Reflex made his head swivel round to look at it.
A split second later, another sound pierced the room.
Harry swung his head back to Malfoy.
He was still kneeling in the same position, but the guttural moan now emanating from the boy’s
mouth, muffled by both the pillowcase and the teeth that bit down on it, was one of the worst
sounds Harry had ever heard. The boy’s eyes were squeezed tightly shut, his body rigid with pain,
and his knuckles white over the Mark as his fingers dug into the bruised flesh.
Harry stood stunned.
Malfoy’s groaning was rapidly growing into a fully-fledged desperate roar behind the twisted cloth.
The sound broke fleetingly only when the boy tried to draw in a ragged breath, and then it started
up again.
Harry’s heartbeat was racing in his chest, his fist clenching around his wand as he looked about him
despairingly for something to do. But what could he do? It wasn’t like there was someone casting
the Cruciatus curse that he could try and stop. It seemed likely the curse was emanating from
Malfoy’s Mark. How was he supposed to stop that?
Suddenly, Malfoy keeled over and curled in on himself. But it was far from over.
The strangled cries didn’t stop, and Harry was just beginning to realise why Malfoy had covered the
floor with cushions. The boy began writhing and squirming, his body thrusting against the cushions,
scattering them until he was knocking his head and limbs against the unforgiving stone floor.
Harry threw off his cloak and rushed forward.
He lunged at the other boy, using his body weight to subdue him, and then grabbing at Malfoy’s
arms, he pinned them against the blonde’s sides.
Harry rolled his weight off, keeping his arms wrapped tightly around the writhing boys torso, and
pushed Malfoy into a sitting position. Slipping behind the Slytherin he positioned the boy’s body
- 242 -
between his legs and pulled him back until Harry was leaning his back against the foot of the couch
for purchase. He had no choice but to clutch Malfoy’s back firmly to his chest, using his own arms to
restrict the Slytherins movement as much as possible.
Malfoy’s struggling seemed to abate somewhat at the contact, and when Harry was reasonably sure
the boy couldn’t do too much damage he laid his head back on the couch and wondered how long
this was going to last. The groaning had not lessened in intensity, but the hoarseness of Malfoy’s
throat meant that it wasn’t as loud, though it didn’t look like letting up either.
Harry’s glasses were uncomfortably skewed on his face, but he didn’t dare try to free an arm to fix
them, so he resigned himself to waiting it out until he could release the other boy. It was obvious
that this was a regular occurrence, and the thought shook Harry. He vaguely wondered if all Death
Eaters endured the same.
Harry renewed his grip as Malfoy almost managed to wrench an arm free. He looked down at what
was visible of the suffering boys features. A deep line was etched between his brows and sweat was
dripping down the side of his face. Harry wondered if Malfoy was aware that someone was with him
or if the pain was too intense to register anything else. It was a blessing that the blonde’s head
didn’t thrash about on Harry’s shoulder, yet the Slytherins body was so taught against Harry that he
wondered if this wasn’t some form of Cruciatus - inflicted through the Mark instead of a wand.
It seemed like hours, but it was only about three minutes from start to finish before Malfoy’s hoarse
groans died off and his tense and pain racked body finally fell limp. Harry lifted his head off the
couch and looked down, tentatively loosening his hold on the other boy and finally lifting an arm to
straighten his glasses. He wondered briefly if Malfoy had passed out, but then the blonde head,
which had lagged forward, slowly lifted and sagged back against Harry’s shoulder, rolling limply
outwards.
The part of the Slytherins face that Harry could see was white and clammy looking and his breaths
came in shallow pants. An impatient, broken grunt sounded, and Harry moved quickly to undo the
gag. But before he could dislodge himself from the Slytherin, Malfoy turned to inspect the person he
was leaning against.
Bloodshot, heavy lidded grey eyes met concerned, searching, bespectacled green ones.
Malfoy groaned and closed his eyes again, croaking in a whiney voice something that sounded like
“Oh no. Why did it have to be you?” before the exhausted Slytherin finally succumbed to enforced
sleep.
Harry breathed a deep sigh and rubbed at his eyes under his glasses before pushing the frames
back up his nose and letting his own head fall back against the couch.
~*~*~*~*~
Harry woke feeling groggy and wondering at the pain in his neck when the memory of what had
happened the previous night and where he currently was drifted rudely back to him. His eyes flew
open at the realisation he had carelessly fallen asleep on a couch while he’d been waiting for Malfoy
to come to. He wrenched his head out of the uncomfortable position it had been lolling in only to
find himself staring down the tip of a wand.
Harry blinked twice. Malfoy’s pale figure came into focus.
The Slytherin was abundantly emitting cold fury as he stood before Harry’s sprawled form.
“Malfoy.” Harry groaned. He closed his eyes and rubbed the indents on the bridge of his nose left
there by his glasses and settled back into the couch. The sickly looking boy did not respond. He kept
his piercing gaze on Harry, and his wand rigidly aimed.
- 243 -
Lifting his arm, Harry tried to work the crick out of his neck as he eyed the Slytherin, wondering
how long he’d been standing there battling with himself over whether to hex Harry limb from limb
or not.
“That’s not really very polite. Considering.” Harry remarked, nodding at the wand. But Malfoy
continued his threatening pose, making Harry feel more and more uneasy. Harry began to edge his
hand around the side of the couch in search of his wand.
Malfoy followed his movements. “Looking for this?” With a triumphant glint in his sunken eyes he
slid Harry’s wand from his robe and dangled it between his fingers.
Harry swallowed.
“Yes. As a matter of fact.” He replied with more calm than he felt. He reached out his hand slowly.
“Care to return it?”
“No.” Malfoy said bluntly. He pulled it away from Harry and slid it back into his robes. “I don’t think
so.”
Harry’s anger bubbled beneath the surface at the predictable answer. His jaw tightened as he
decided enough was enough.
“Look Malfoy, I’m not in the mood for this. Just give me my wand.” He moved to stand up, and the
other boy backed up slightly. “I’m not going to attack you. I just want my wand back. You owe me
that courtesy.”
“I don’t owe you a thing! And I didn’t ask for your interference.” Malfoy spat.
“Christ, Malfoy!” Harry exasperated. “You could be just a little bit more grateful. I stopped your
bony butt from getting seriously hurt last night and I wake up with your wand in my face! I helped
you and the least you can do is–”
“I didn’t need any help!” The Slytherin growled. His knuckles whitened over his wand. “And believe
me, you would be the Very. Last. Person. I would ask.”
Malfoy sneered aggressively. “You and your sycophantic sidekicks are sickening enough from a
distance without you barging into my personal space. I bet the three of you have the Slytherins
vomiting en mass with your group-hugs in that hovel of a common room. Its pathetic the way you
run around playing at being heroes and getting people killed. Not anyone important, of course.” He
ground out. “Not anyone that actually matters.
“That hapless prat Longbottom, for instance.” Malfoy hissed, impervious to the blood and thunder
glare that Harry was sending his way. “He hung off you like a leach, but he was. Never. Quite. Good
enough to join your little ‘Golden Gryffindors’ threesome, was he? And yet he was good enough to
die for you like the willing little Mudblood-loving fodder he was.” The Slytherin’s face was flushed
and spiteful. “Purebloods have always paid a higher price than Mudbloods.”
Harry’s fists were balled so tightly his fingernails were digging into his palms.
“The saviour of the wizarding world?” Malfoy mocked as he looked Harry up and down. “Pleeease!
You’re a walking magnet to misery, and anyone near you gets hurt. If you really want to help your
fellow wizard then go throw yourself off the nearest–”
Malfoy was cut off by Harry’s fist as it crunched into the Slytherin’s cheek. The boy reeled sideways
in shock, stumbling a few feet away from Harry. Harry pulled back his fist ready to punch Malfoy
again if he tried to retaliate but stayed his arm when the other boy turned in a slow controlled
movement to face his aggressor. Blood wept from the corner of his mouth.
Malfoy scowled as he slowly wiped at the sticky fluid. He looked down at the red smear on the back
of his hand and snorted.
- 244 -
“I repeat. I. Did. Not. Need. Your. Help. Nor will I ever!” He wiped his hand on his robes, his eyes
glittering with malice.
And it hit Harry suddenly why Malfoy hadn’t approached him. The Slytherin hated him. Not just the
hate that people carelessly bandy around daily. This was a deep seeded, festering hatred. Malfoy
loathed him so much that he was willing to suffer torture and the threat of death rather than ask for
help from the Gryffindor. The realisation was disturbing. Harry already had one deadly arch-nemisis
in Voldemort. Sure, Malfoy was no Dark Lord, but he was vicious and passionate and could
potentially prove a dangerous enemy – if he survived his current pickle.
Harry let out a weary breath and raked a hand through messy hair. If Malfoy wouldn’t come to him,
then he would go to Malfoy.
“Well I need yours.”
Malfoy hesitated. “… What?”
Harry looked off to the side, finding this more difficult than he would have imagined. Not that he’d
ever imagined needing to go to Draco Malfoy for help. Not for anything. It would have been a
complete waist of time under any normal circumstances. Malfoy would automatically reject him,
then sneer and mock him for days afterwards – perhaps even weeks. It was unthinkable.
But these were not normal circumstances.
“You’re not going to make this easy for me, are you?” Harry said under his breath. He turned his
gaze back to the other boy. “I need to get into the pensieve in the Headmistresses office, but I can’t
get passed the protective spell.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened, but they quickly narrowed again. “Why are you interested in the old nags
memory bowl?” He asked suspiciously.
“Dumbledore left something in it that I would like to see.”
“What?”
“I don’t know,” Harry could tell the other boy was fishing to find out what he might know, but his
impatience reflected in his voice. “I just know that its there, and that I need to see it.”
“Why me?”
“What?”
“Why do you need me?” He asked, and then added scathingly. “The mudblood finally found a limit
to her dazzling talents?”
“Her name is Hermione.” Harry said darkly.
“Ahh.” Malfoy soothed knowingly. “The task is beneath the untouchable trio. Wouldn’t want to sully
yourselves with any dark magic, would you?” He scoffed and shook his head slightly. “Not good
enough for you, but good enough for me. Right?”
“Malfoy! Cut the crap!” Harry bit out, unable to hold in his anger any longer. “I know that you need
access to that pensieve as much as I do. I know that what happened to you last night has been
going on for some time. I know that He’s hurting you through the Mark and I think I know why…”
Harry’s voice trailed off.
Malfoy masked the flash of vulnerability that crossed his face almost immediately. White fury took
its place as he renewed the aim of his wand, and Harry wondered if he’d finally pushed the Slytherin
too far.
“What the hell were you doing here last night? How did you get in?”
- 245 -
There was panic behind the ire in Malfoy’s voice, and the dark rings under his eyes made them
appear sunken and afraid against his pale skin. His jaw where Harry’s fist had landed was quickly
growing red and swollen and angry looking. Harry hesitated. He was almost certain now that Malfoy
was unaware Snape had recruited him.
Harry decided on as much truth as possible. “I came in with you. I was checking the area when I
heard footsteps.” Harry blushed and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly with his hand. “I … er …
fell through the door when you opened it.”
Malfoy continued to eye Harry suspiciously. “How did you know I wanted to get into the pensieve?”
“Its not that hard to figure out.” Harry’s voice was subdued. “Makes sense in a... sick sort of way.”
“What do you mean?” The Slytherin asked cautiously.
Harry sighed. “Our history is pretty much conducive to something like this, don’t you think?”
Malfoy’s steely glare eased slightly. Harry could guess the thoughts that were going through the
other boy’s head because they were going through his own at that moment.
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy had always rucked heads on everything. Whether it was in
classrooms, in the halls, on the Quidditch pitch, or in the war against Voldemort, they had always
been on opposite sides. Always competing against one another. What had started as nasty childish
bantering had quickly turned bitter and full of malice as they grew, becoming what it was today. It
was tiring, to say the least, having to watch your enemy all of the time. Harry should know. He had
spent a good part of last year obsessed with Malfoy. It might have been the same this year but for
the tiny issue of recovering and destroying Voldemorts soul. Piece by piece.
In the end, for one reason or another, Potter and Malfoy were continually pitted against each
another. And there was no reason to believe that would ever change.
“McGonagall’s out of the castle all night tomorrow.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “What?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and lowered his wand slightly. “I heard the old battle-axe in the staff room.
She’s going to some … gathering or other at the Ministry.” He held Harry’s wand out in resentful
offering. “We can do it then.”
Harry took his wand slowly, only slightly relieved at Malfoy’s sudden amiable stance, knowing that
as quickly as the change had befallen the other boy, it would reverse again when it no longer
serviced his needs. It was a shallow reprieve. Tentative and empty.
Harry flicked his wand, summoning his invisibility cloak from the floor behind the couch. “What time
should I–”
“Be here at a quarter to ten.” Malfoy grumbled. His gaze shifted uncomfortably to the side.
“Neophyte.”
“Pardon me?” Harry asked, surprised at the uncalled for name-calling.
Malfoy huffed impatiently. “Its the password, ignoramus.”
“O-oh.” Harry stuttered, barely able to take in the fleeting reprieve from being insulted only to be
insulted in earnest. He nodded his head once, threw his cloak over his arm, and then headed out
the door.

26. Uncovering Draco Malfoy - Part 2
“Harry!”
As he exited the stairs from the dungeons, he looked up to see Ginny bounding down the marble
stairs in the Entrance Hall. Luna was drifting along behind her dreamily. His face broke into a wide
grin at the sight of his girlfriend. She returned his smile before launching herself at him.
There was something about the way Ginny hugged that warmed Harry instantly, and he buried his
nose in her neck to savour the embrace. Cuddling, Harry had decided, was one of the things in life
that no one should have to live without. Kissing of course was also on the list. As were many other
things that Harry looked forward to doing with Ginny. But that would be after she had graduated.
Harry wanted to give her plenty of time. He wanted to make sure she was comfortable and he
wanted everything to be just right. Perfect for Ginny.
“Where were you all night?” She pulled back to meet his gaze. “Hermione’s been chewing people
out all morning! I think she’s worried about you.”
“I’d better skip breakfast and go on up.” Harry glanced guiltily up the stairs. “I’ll see you later?”
“Mmm. I’m meeting mum early.” Ginny said. “She wants to have meals with the family on the
weekends, so she’ll be at our table when you come down for lunch.” She flashed a smile and
planted a chaste kiss on Harry’s lips. “So where were you anyway?”
“I fell asleep.” He replied a little sheepishly.
“Oh, I hope you didn’t spend the night out by the lake.” Luna said, widening her eyes at him. “It’s
the Gurglepod fondling season, you know.”
“Um… No.” Harry shook his head with a smile. “I fell asleep in the dungeons.”
A small frown creased Ginny’s brow. “That wouldn’t have been much better. It’s freezing down there
at night now.”
Harry shrugged. “It was alright. Anyway, I’d better catch up with Ron and Hermione. I’ll see you at
lunch?”
“Okay.” She kissed again, this time lingering her goodbye, and then turned with Luna to enter the
Great Hall. A few feet away, Ernie gave Harry a knowing wink and strolled off after them.
The second Harry set foot in the common room he was accosted by Colin Creevey. The sixth year
slapped him sharply on the back and yelled too loudly by his ear, announcing Harry’s return to
everyone in the room whether they cared or not.
Harry blushed despite himself.
Pansy glanced at him with a small crease between her brows as she passed, and Blaise gave him a
hesitant nod before joining her, both of them exiting the portrait hole presumably on their way to
breakfast.
Harry turned to watch them depart.
It had surprised Harry when Pansy Parkinson had turned up to the first DA meeting of the term last
Monday night with Blaise, and to be truthful, he hadn’t been happy about her presence to begin
with.
The first thing she had done was to complain bitterly about the name of the group.
She had formally proposed (and then passed her own motion) that it needed changing. Then she
- 247 -
unabashedly offered up “Quasi Requiters” as being a much more proactive (not to mention classier)
name. The glares she had received for her trouble (the most deadly being that from Hermione) had
failed to intimidate her into silence, indeed, she had continued to offer increasingly obscure
'alernatives' for the groups name. After much creasing of foreheads from the other members in the
room, and snarky comments from Pansy about the “uninspired and sapless” name, Seamus had
stood up, aimed his wand, and hit her with a silencing charm before Hermione (who had been
steadily turning redder and was now visibly shaking) broke out of Ron’s increasingly nervous hold
and performed the unforgivable of her choosing on the pug-faced girl.
The name was not altered and Pansy had sulked. But as the meeting had worn on and the
delegation of duties had been handed out, she had raised her arms and started waving them about
irritatingly so that Harry had no other option but to remove the charm. First she pointedly scowled
in Seamus’s general direction and then she protested loudly (once again) because she hadn’t been
assigned any patrols.
On the Thursday, Pansy had taken her first shift partnered with Michael Corner. Michael hadn’t been
a very happy lad when they had returned to the common room, but he begrudgingly informed Harry
that she had done an annoyingly thorough job of checking the halls.
So Pansy Parkinson, She-Slytherin and ex-girlfriend of Draco Malfoy, was now a member of the DA.
Things were definitely getting weird.
“Where have you been?”
Hermione must be in bossy mode, thought Harry as her voice cut through the room. She and Ron
were standing in a small group of DA students crowded around a piece of parchment.
“I fell asleep.” Harry said shortly. “What’s this?” He asked.
“It’s the new roster for ‘Ginny-Minding’.” Dean said wryly. “Luna and Ernie are with her until after
breakfast. Then it’s just me since Mrs. Weasley’s here.”
“I’m really grateful to you all for doing this.” Harry looked at the people around him. Seamus and
Dean waved their hands to dismiss Harry’s thanks and Justin gave him a quick nod of assent.
“Er … can I speak to you two for a minute?” Harry caught his two best friends eyes. “Um … up in the
room?” They nodded and Hermione gave the parchment to Dean.
“Its each persons job to make sure the next one on the list knows. Okay?” She said. Dean nodded
and Harry left for his dorm room, Ron and Hermione trailing behind.
“What’s up then?” Ron finally asked as he closed the door behind them. “Is this something to do
with where you were last night?” He moved to his bed and plonked himself down on the edge of it
next to Hermione, picking up her hand and encasing it between his palms. Harry leaned against his
bedpost.
“Yeah. There’s something I have to tell you.” He began tentatively. “I guess I haven’t really been
fair on you both to keep it a secret. I think you have the right to know. It concerns you after all. But
er … don’t get mad alright? I feel bad enough for keeping it from you in the first place.”
As expected, Ron’s eyebrows lifted marginally, but Harry was surprised to see the colour completely
drain from Hermione’s face.
Mildly alarmed, Harry pulled himself off the bedpost. “Are you okay, Hermione?”
Her eyes glazed over and her fingers gripped Ron’s hand so tightly, he yelped.
Ron leaned forward inspecting her face. “Hermione? What?” He placed an arm around her
shoulders.
She swallowed, avoiding their gazes. “N-nothing. I-I. I’m just worried about you, Harry. That’s all.”
- 248 -
She sniffed deeply and lifted her free hand, pressing the back of it to her nose in an effort to quell
the tears that were rapidly pooling in her eyes. She glanced quickly at Ron. “Y-you know what he’s
like.” She babbled on hastily. “Always getting into trouble. E-especially when one of us isn’t around
to keep an eye on him.”
Harry studied her fidgeting, and when she continued to avoid his gaze he moved to stand in front of
her. “Hermione. What’s really the matter?”
She looked at him almost pleadingly and the tears finally overflowed and spilled down her cheeks. “I
jus-just worry about you. You’ve been through so much…” she hiccoughed and stared at the hands
wringing madly in her lap. “Its just not fair that it’s al-always you Harry.” Her voice was sounding
broken and more desperate as she went on. “It-Its just… its not-not fair that it always has to be
you…”
“Heyyy.” Ron pulled her into a hug as she trailed off choking down sobs. He tucked her head under
his chin and awkwardly patted her back. “Shh. It’s alright.” Her shoulders shook as she now cried
freely into Ron’s chest, clinging to him as he comforted her.
Harry watched on, frozen. Stunned at Hermione’s outburst, which had contained rather hurtful
truths.
It was like an unspoken agreement between the three of them. They didn’t discuss issues that were
pointless and upsetting. They didn’t dwell on things that they couldn’t do anything about. But
suddenly Hermione was sobbing her heart out over Harry’s life.
And it unsettled him greatly.
Hermione was cracking the walls of their carefully constructed damn. Chiselling at the stone that
held all of the bad feelings at bay. A small leak like this could undo everything. Unleash all of the
pain so carefully vaulted away and bring it cascading into the open. Harry could not deal with all of
that right now. There was still more to do. He couldn’t afford to be smashed against his nightmares
as the damn burst. That would leave him broken and useless. He couldn’t stop now.
“… Mate.”
Harry blinked and looked at Ron.
Ron was watching Harry, full of concern. “She’s just been working too hard.” He said soothingly.
“Don’t take it to heart.”
Hermione raised her head, sniffing and wiping at the dampness on her face. “I-I’m sorry.” She said
wetly. “Ron’s right.” Gathering herself and pulling at the last of the moisture on her cheeks she
stood up and gave Harry a firm squeeze. “I’m so sorry Harry. I didn’t mean what I said.
Everything’s fine. Really.”
Harry raised his arms with uncertainty to hug her back, still feeling like he had been hit by half a
dozen bludgers at once. Hermione continued to squeeze Harry for all he was worth. Then finally she
pulled back.
“So.” She said briskly, sliding in beside Ron again, still sniffling but looking all business. “What were
you going to tell us?”
“Yeah,” Ron said. “What really happened last night?”
Harry took a deep breath, trying to put the last few minutes out of his mind. “Right. Well. Like I said
… I don’t want you to get angry, so I’m warning you up front you’re not going to like it. Okay?”
The two of them nodded, having no other option but to agree. So Harry started his story.
He told them everything about Snape. About his role on Halloween and his request that it stay
between them, and then he related to them everything Snape had divulged when he last dropped in
on Harry. He then went on to tell them about Draco Malfoy and the previous night. By the time
- 249 -
Harry had finished, he had successfully fielded most of their questions. Ron’s initial angry shock that
Harry had been interacting with Snape proved quite disruptive until Hermione’s impatience to hear
the rest of the story won out. Hermione’s annoyance at the risk Harry had taken fizzled too at the
mention of Malfoy’s mission.
Of course, they immediately informed Harry that they were accompanying him to his meeting with
Malfoy on Sunday night, but Harry stopped them in their tracks. Whatever Malfoy was using to
avoid detection (Hermione, suggesting it may be an invisibility cloak that was also unplottable)
would prove more than adequate to escape them and Harry knew there was no way the Slytherin
would go along with it if Ron and Hermione were there. Eventually it was agreed upon that Harry
would go alone – if only to view the pensieve. Any further searching for the item they would do
together.
Afterwards, they wandered down to the Great Hall for lunch and sat at the Gryffindor table as Mrs.
Weasley, flanked by a blushing Pete on one side and Ginny on the other, regaled the other students
with stories of some of her surprisingly mischievous years at Hogwarts. She was flushed with colour
and had a sparkle to her eyes, and had everyone guffawing and gasping so often that even
Professor Sprout, who hadn’t been her usual self since Halloween, joined in.
The pudding plates had vanished long before the crowd finally broke up and Mrs. Weasley retired to
her quarters with Ginny and Dean to have afternoon tea. Ron and Hermione settled on one of the
common room couches by the fire with their books in hand, and Harry retreated to his bed, deciding
it would be a good opportunity to catch up on some missed sleep.
As he shifted around looking for the most comfortable position for his overly full stomach Harry
wondered if Malfoy had had any lunch.
~*~*~*~*~
When Harry appeared in the Great Hall for dinner he was not particularly hungry, so it was a bit of a
non-event. It was past seven thirty when Harry sat down at a study table in the library with Ginny
to research his transfiguration homework. His full body transformations were successful almost
every time now, only small details like colour or texture ever differed slightly from what he was
aiming for.
Ginny flicked through her Herbology text as Harry got up and went to the shelves. He fingered along
the spines and pulled out a small, soft leather book and returned to his seat. He by-passed the
index and went straight to page 111.
“Why are you reading that?”
Harry looked up from the page he had previously left off. Ginny had set her book down and had her
head tilted, reading the title ‘Boor to Beast’. Harry shrugged.
“Just interested.” He answered. “I think I would like being an animagus. It would be handy if… ”
Harry trailed off. He thought it would have been a great advantage if he were an auror. But he had
stopped kidding himself that that was ever going to happen.
“If what?” She pressed, leaning forward.
“I don’t know. I just like the idea of being able to transform into a creature, you know?”
“It’d be handy for when you’re an auror too.”
Harry looked back at the book. “It would still be good. Even if I can’t be an auror.”
“You will be a formidable auror, Harry.” Ginny took the book from his grip and closed it. “You told
- 250 -
me once that McGonagall said she was going to help you become one - if it was the last thing she
ever did.” Her lips curved into an amused grin.
Harry leaned back in his chair. He sighed as he lifted his hands behind his head. “I just can’t see it
happening, Gin. I’m already two subjects short and the ones I am taking I’m so far behind in that
I’d be lucky to avoid Trolls in any of them. I know she meant it at the time, but the NEWTS are only
months away now.”
“Harry.” Ginny said. “We are talking McGonagall.” As if that explained everything. “She knows that
you’re busy with other things. I’d bet my last knut that she has something sorted for you.”
Harry smiled and leaned across the table so he was only inches from Ginny’s face. “You’re right. We
are talking McGonagall, aren’t we?” He closed the gap between them and kissed her lightly; letting
his lips linger far longer than necessary. “You are a smart young lady, Ginny Weasley. Oh. That
reminds me,” He said, pulling back to rest against his chair again and crossing his arms over his
chest. “How come you didn’t tell me you did so well in your OWLS?”
Ginny’s eyebrows shot up. She sat back as well, colour flushing up her cheeks. “How do you know
about that?”
“Lupin told me.” He frowned at her. Why was she so embarrassed?
“Oh.” She said flatly. “Listen Harry. What I am about to tell you is something that I’m not at all
proud of, and I have every intention of telling McGonagall too at the end of the year, but until then,
I need you to keep it quiet.”
Harry nodded, his frown deepening.
“Well.” Ginny kept her eyes on the table. “Keeping in mind how difficult it was to sit exams last
year. Well … after Dumbledore’s death, and … everything you had to go through … and then our
break-up,” She took a deep breath and let it out again as if bracing for something. “How do I say
this? Oh hell. FredandGeorgegavemeWizWonderMallows…” She darted her eyes up to Harry’s.
“And… I used them.”
“They gave you what?” Harry uncrossed his arms and sat forward.
“They offered me a bunch of Weasley Wiz-Wonder-Mallows, more than enough to eat one before
each OWL paper I sat, and so I did … take them, I mean. But I haven't used any since!”
Ginny’s blush renewed itself with gusto under Harry’s intense stare.
“They were only trying to help,” She rushed on. “And the magic was only supposed to be mild. Oh
Harry, I was such a mess at the funeral after we broke up. Everything just came crushing down on
me in one hit and you weren’t there and Fred and George found me blubbering under the Quidditch
stands and I was scared and they only wanted to help.”
Ginny watched as Harry sighed, shook his head slowly and stood. Her eyes glistened with panic and
moisture. She twisted her fingers together as Harry walked around the table and grabbed the chair
beside her. He sat down and pulled her hands towards him, leaning in so her forehead rested on his
shoulder.
“I should have known your brothers had something to do with it.” He said dryly, smoothing her hair
gently with one hand.
Ginny lifted her head reluctantly. “They meant well, Harry.”
“So what are these Wiz-Wonder-Mallows then?” He asked quietly.
“They’re marshmallows.” She said. “Er … obviously.” She added at Harry’s wry look. “Their magic is
not supposed to help you cheat … as such, which is why they couldn’t be picked up by the
examiners, they’re only supposed to help you shut out everything that isn’t relative to what you're
doing so you can pull on everything you have learned about whatever it is you’re concentrating on.
- 251 -
That way you’re at your peak of whatever you are capable of. But… it seems that they were quite a
bit more successful than expected.”
“What are you going to say to McGonagall? Do you want me to go with you?”
“The truth. Fred and George insisted on coming with me too. They wanted to take the full blame but
I’m the one who used them so… that wouldn’t be right. Still, if I get expelled, Fred and George said
they’d set me up in the old Zonko’s when it’s ready to open. Once the trouble dies down.” She
smiled, but didn’t look too happy all the same. “They said it would be my place.”
Harry brushed his thumb lightly on her cheek. “I don’t think McGonagall would expel anyone for
doing something out of character at the end of last year. Still, running a joke shop could be fun. You
could have extra long lunches with me when I can get to Hogsmeade to visit.”
Ginny beamed and raked her hand through Harry’s silky black mop. “You are wonderful. You know
that? Are you horribly disappointed in me?”
Harry gazed into her vivid green depths. “No.” He said simply.
Their lips connected again, and Harry thought her kisses tasted like peaches and cherry blossom.
They went back to studying for a couple of hours, before eventually leaving for the common room.
Ginny retreated to bed and Harry glanced around at the students who were lounging around the
room, finding an odd mix of Hufflepuff, Gryffindors and Slytherins, before climbing the stairs to his
own room.
The social dynamics in the common room had actually settled into a less violent routine by the end
of last term, and surprisingly had somehow morphed over the holidays so that it was positively
benign at times now. Harry would never have believed it possible at the beginning of his seventh
year and as he headed upstairs to offload his bag he passed by the locked doors and wondered if it
was time to open them again. Strangely, no one had even requested they be opened since
Halloween.
Harry decided it wouldn’t be wise to fix something that wasn’t broken.
He realised he was hungry as he dumped his bag on the floor by the bed. He plonked himself down
and started to remove his jacket, but then changed his mind and opened the bedside draw,
grabbing the purple potion of Julie’s out. He held it up to the light, saw it was still almost a quarter
full, and shoved the crystal bottle into his jacket pocket before heading back down the stairs. He
walked over to Ron and Hermione whom he’d spotted on his way in curled up together in an
oversized armchair. Ron was fast asleep with his head tilted back and his mouth hanging open.
Hermione, of course, had her nose in a book.
“I’m going to the kitchens to get something to eat.” Harry half-whispered once he was near them.
Hermione looked up at him. “Do you want me to bring anything back?”
She smiled and shook her head. “No thanks.” She rolled her eyes in Ron’s direction. “I’ll be doing
the lockup soon anyway. Ron volunteered to keep me company so you don’t have to worry about
rounds tonight.”
“Oh.” Harry was beginning to see this thing between his two best friends might actually have fringe
benefits. “Tell him I said thanks, will you?” Hermione nodded and Harry left for the kitchens.
~*~*~*~*~
Harry was surrounded by eager elves as he stood in the kitchen. He smiled nervously and requested
a tray of left overs enough for two to take with him. His jacket pockets were being stuffed with
sweets and cakes by those elves not fetching sandwiches and legs of chicken while he waited.
- 252 -
Dobby came out of the cluster of elves and threw himself awkwardly at Harry’s leg and clung there
adoringly.
“Harry Potter has come to see Dobby!” The elf squeaked as tears brimmed his enormous pale green
eyes.
“Er …” Harry said, his eyes flicking over the elf’s attire.
Dobby had something that looked like a mangy dead cat on his head, a glittering silver boobtube on
his torso, and a purple and yellow tartan kilt complete with sporran. His hands and feet were
wrapped thickly in dirty rags and old tea towels.
“Dobby, are you okay?”
“Dobby is pleased to see you, Sir!” Dobby said wondrously as if it were obvious. Harry very gently
pried the little elf off his leg and squatted as the other elves began shuffling away.
“It’s good to see you too.” Harry frowned. “Where’s Kreacher?”
Dobby dithered, his expression turning guilty and then said barely audibly. “Kreacher is serving his
false Master, Sir.”
“Who is…?” Harry hesitated. “Do you mean Malfoy? Is Kreacher with Draco?”
The elf bowed his head. “Yes Sir.” He said quietly. “Dobby knows young Master Malfoy is Harry
Potter's enemy but the young Master…”
“What?”
“The young Master is fevered, Sir. He is fading. Dobby could not let him fade, Sir. The young Master
was once my Family.” The little elf’s words tumbled over one another in his haste as he stared at his
covered hands. “ Dobby would never forgive himself–”
“Dobby,” Harry soothed as he placed hand on the elf’s skinny shoulder. “Its okay. Just tell me
what’s going on.”
Dobby looked pleadingly at Harry. “Dobby has seen when Master Malfoy screams and burns. The
young Master does not bare well the darkness in him. Dobby feels he needs to help. Dobby is letting
Kreacher sneak food. But young Master Malfoy does not eat. The food comes back.” Dobby’s
distress leaked down his wrinkled cheeks. “Says it’s poisoned. Doesn’t trust Kreacher or Dobby.
Even the young Miss cannot help him. Dobby does not know what to do. If the–”
“Whoa… Back up.” Harry interrupted. “What ‘young Miss’?”
Dobby’s eyes went wide in horror. “Dobby is not supposed to be speaking of that!” He breathed.
The elf promptly picked up the nearest thing he could get his hands on, (a rather large old silver tea
pot) and moved to bang it against his forehead in earnest, but Harry reached out speedily and
grabbed it from his grip.
“Who else knows he’s here, Dobby?”
The little elf hobbled on his feet, shifting his weight nervously but didn’t speak or look Harry in the
eye.
“Dobby.”
“She said she would cut Dobby’s ears off and put them in Harry Potters stew if I told.” He squeaked.
“No she won’t. Who ever she is. I promise you Dobby. Tell me who.”
The elf winced. “Miss Parkinson, Sir.”
- 253 -
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Pansy?”
“Yes Sir.” Dobby squeaked urgently, and continued on hurriedly. “Dobby wanted to tell Harry Potter.
Dobby punishes hiself but cannot say anything. Master Malfoy has not hurt anyone else, Sir. Only
hiself. And Miss Parkinson made Dobby swear and she is a Mistress of Hogwarts...”
“Don’t worry about it.” Harry said distractedly, before concentrating on the elf again. “Dobby. You
are not to punish yourself anymore. Do you hear me? No matter what happens. Do you understand?
No more feeling guilty, okay?”
“Yes Sir.” Dobby replied sadly.
“All right. Leave it to me.” Harry said slowly and rose to stand again. “You should go and see
Madame Pomphrey about those.” He added, nodding at Dobby’s injuries.
“Oh no, Sir.” Dobby said in surprise. “Dobby is having much worse under his old Master.”
Just then three elves came bustling up balancing a tray loaded with enough food for half a dozen
people. Harry took off the leg of ham and one or two other things, handing them back to one of the
elves with an apologetic grin, and grimaced at Dobby.
“I really think you should go to Madame Pomphrey. Maybe I should order you to go?”
“Dobby is having un-indaba soon.”
“What’s that?”
“To help, Sir. Dobby is having his third un-indaba.” The elf fumbled with his sporren looking
inordinately pleased with himself.
“Oh. Right. Er… Good.” Harry said, not having a clue as to what un-indaba was but imagining it was
most likely some sort of herb or potion with healing properties.
He left the kitchens carrying the tray of leftovers and headed for the dungeons.
Harry whispered the password to the stone wall, which opened into the Slytherin common room. He
looked around for the reason he had come as he walked stiffly into the room, the stone wall closing
behind him.
The room looked exactly as it had when he’d entered it the last time. But there was no sign of
Malfoy. Harry walked over to the coffee table setting the tray down before heading towards the door
he had seen the other boy emerge from. It was slightly ajar, so Harry eased it open a little more,
cringing at the slight creak it made, and slipped through it. He walked lightly, not wanting to alert
Malfoy to the fact that he was here until he could see the Slytherin face to face, knowing the blonde
would likely don his invisibility cloak or whatever. Harry didn’t want to entertain the thought of
coming all this way just to get snubbed.
There were doors lining the snugly curved, barely lit passageway, and Harry gently tried the handle
of each one as he went, but none opened. The corridor then curved in the opposite direction as he
continued, but still no sign of Malfoy. It was impossible to see very far ahead in the ‘S’ shaped
passageway and abruptly Harry came upon the end. The door facing him was the same as all the
ones he’d passed with one exception. This door was open. A narrow plume of light splayed out from
the narrow gap into the corridor.
Harry took a deep breath and pushed the door gently inwards, taking a tentative step into the
room.
Then he stilled.
In his peripheral vision, he registered the blur of Malfoy standing just behind the door so he swung
his head round to meet the other boy. Harry saw the flicker of relief that flashed across the pointy
face.
- 254 -
Malfoy had his arm stretched out rigidly in front of him, his wand hovering inches from Harry’s nose.
“Do you want to die?” Malfoy’s angry voice ground out.
Harry relaxed slightly. “Stop big-noting yourself and put that wand down, Malfoy. I didn’t come here
to start anything.” That wasn’t entirely true, but Malfoy didn’t need to know that.
“Why are you here? I said tomorrow night, moron.” The Slytherin sneered.
Harry was gazing at the tip of the boy’s wand, partially hypnotized as it wavered in front of his face,
drifting slowly to and fro. Harry dragged his eyes away to peer at the Slytherin properly.
The first thing he noticed was that the boy’s normally pale cheeks were flushed with colour. Also,
his usually taught mouth was open a small way, his lips red, wet and slack, and he had a glazed
look in his eyes. His blonde hair was tussled and his clothes wrinkled like he’d just got out of bed
and he was swaying gently where he stood. It occurred to Harry that the boy might really have a
fever, and that the house elf hadn’t just been referring to the same thing Harry had seen.
But then Harry saw the bottle clutched in Malfoy’s other hand that hung by his leg. Its label
indicated that it was a bottle of Ogden’s Finest.
And it was three-quarters empty.
“You’re drunk.” Harry said flatly.
“I. Do not. Get. Drunk. Potter!” The Slytherin snorted in disgust. “Its for medicinal purposes.” He
slurred the last words.
“Right. Fine. Whatever.” Harry sighed. “I’ve brought some food. Looks like you could do with
something to eat.”
“I’m not hungry. And even if I was I wouldn’t take food from you!” Malfoy sneered.
“Well I am. So you can either join me, or watch me eat.” Harry didn’t wait for a response, just took
out his wand and summoned the tray of food. A loud echoing clatter rang out soon after from the
other end of the passage and Harry winced and waited for the probably now empty tray to reach
him. It soared into view still loaded with food. Harry grabbed it and looked at it in surprise.
“I spelled the acoustics.”
Harry looked at the other boy who had finally lowered his wand.
Malfoy raised a snarky eyebrow. “You sounded like a herd of hippogriffs.” He turned away from
Harry, swaggering as he walked.
The room was almost triangular and the two longer walls were lined with beds arranged in unusal
ways to best fit the impractical shape. One of the smaller walls had a large iron fireplace in the
middle of it with a small but comfortable carpeted area with large flat rectangular green and silver
cushions surrounding it.
Malfoy set himself down on one of the cushions and leaned back against a nearby bedpost, drawing
his knees up loosely and resting his wrists atop them. He lifted the bottle to his mouth and tilting
his head back, tipped some of the amber liquid down his throat.
Harry followed the Slytherin and set the tray down on the floor between them, lowering himself
onto a cushion and leaning against the opposite bedpost, acutely aware of the other boy’s half-
lidded gaze on him.
He felt thoroughly self-conscious being scrutinized and couldn’t bring himself to eat, so he stretched
over the tray and swiped the bottle from Malfoy’s grasp. The Slytherin only watched as Harry
settled back, tilted the bottle and then swallowed a much larger gulp of Firewhiskey than he’d
- 255 -
intended.
Harry then coughed and spluttered and wiped his mouth with the back of a hand. When he looked
up through watery eyes the Slytherin was smirking at him.
“Let me guess. First time?”
“No!” Harry rasped, annoyed at suddenly feeling a little bit pathetic. He took another swig to prove
a point and then handed the bottle back to Malfoy. “Where did you get it anyway?”
“Unlike most students in this Palace of Pueriles, I conquered puberty long ago.” The Slytherin took
another swig.
Harry watched as the other boy brought the bottle to rest. “You stole it. Didn’t you?”
Cold eyes settled on Harry. “It must be debilitating to be so righteous all of the time.” Malfoy
sneered. “I bet when you’re wandering obliviously around with your head held higher than everyone
else’s, you’re thinking about the next undeserving soul you will save.”
Harry closed his eyes briefly, tilting his head back to rest on the bedpost. “I can’t save anyone.” He
said resignedly. “As you have so thoughtfully pointed out." He lifted his head forward and raked a
hand through his black mop. "I try... But it either doesn’t work out ... or I make things worse.”
“Then why are you here?” The other boy asked tonelessly.
The question surprised Harry. He hesitated before answering. “Well, firstly. I thought you might be
hungry.” The Slytherin gave a doubtful scoff. “And secondly. I thought you might want some
company.” Harry avoided the other boy's gaze. “Later.”
Malfoy’s expression went stony. “I told you.” He said darkly. “I don’t need your help.”
“Yeah, well … you could still have something to eat.” Harry said wearily. “You look like death
warmed up.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Charming.”
Harry picked tentatively at the food as the Slytherin took another swig. After the first couple of
mouthfuls he began to appreciate just how long it had been since he’d eaten.
“Do you miss flying?” Harry asked around a mouthful of cheese and pumpkin bread.
Malfoy looked up from watching Harry’s hands at work and rolled his eyes. “What do you think?”
“I do.” Harry went on, ignoring the blonde and picking up a carrot stick. “Not the Quidditch though.
...Strange that.” He frowned. “I guess its because I can’t really think about it right now. But flying.
Just soaring through the air … I miss that.”
Harry raised his eyebrows as a thought occurred to him. “I suppose I could take the Firebolt out
tomorrow. Head down to the Quidditch pitch after lunch for an hour or so…” He trailed off at the
bitter look on Malfoy’s face. “Sorry.” He said quietly.
“Don’t let me drag you down, Potter.” The Slytherin said bitterly. “Merlin forbid if the ‘Chunderous
One’ doesn’t get to fluff about on his broomstick tomorrow afternoon.”
“Do you sit around just thinking up insulting names for me?” Harry asked impatiently.
“Yes.” Malfoy said proudly. “Got loads more. Want to hear them?” He asked, not waiting to hear the
answer. “Let’s see.” He looked at the ceiling thoughtfully. “There’s the ‘Churlish One’, ‘The Bogey
which Loitered’, ‘Chipmunk’s Bum’. That’s one Goyle came up with. Then there's the 'Chivalrous
One'." His voice dripping with sarcasm. " 'The Bragger that Lacked–”
“Malfoy!”
- 256 -
“Oh, and my personal favourite, ‘The Buttocks What Loosened’." The Slytherin smirked. " That one
is self explanatory and particularly useful. Then there’s ‘The Blunderer–”
“ENOUGH!”
Malfoy chuckled softly through his smirk.
~*~*~*~*~
“Potter. What are you doing?”
“Making a sandwich.”
“Out of herrings and musk sticks?”
“Why not?”
“…”
“Try some.”
“Do you want me to vomit up what little I have eaten?”
~*~*~*~*~
“No… Look… Juss… Give it here. You don’t do it like that un-unless you want the lining of your throat
dissholved.”
“Malfoy. Where did that second bottle come from?”
“Now watch…................…ssee? No after… … no aft… …no problem.”
“All right. I think you’ve had enough. Let me try.”
“I’ll have you know, Potter. I will still be standing–”
“Sitting.”
“What? Oh. I will still be 'sitting'… when you are l…lying in a p-hool of your own vomit.”
“Thanks for sharing that image.”
~*~*~*~*~
“…The ‘Cheesey One’, 'The Blemish That Lurked', the ‘Chunderous One’, ‘The Botcher–”
- 257 -
“You ssaid that one already.”
“...What?”
“ ‘Chunderous One’. Tha… that was the firss one you called me.”
“Don't interrupt.”
“…”
“ ‘The By-gone That Lingered’, the ‘Childish One’, 'The Boy Who Blunders'………
~*~*~*~*~
“Draco?”
“What?”
“I feel ssick.”
“Well you should have stopped three quarters of an hour ago. When I did.”
“You had a … a head sstart.”
“Of roughly three and a half years by the look of it. I thought you said you’d had Firewhiskey
before?”
“I hah-ave. For medicing...medish… When I was ssick.”
“Well, once you stop drinking you sober up pretty fast.”
“Oh good. …Uuuuuur.”
“Do not throw up in my sleeping quarters! If you’re going to live up to your pet name then do it in
the bathroom.”
“I think… bathroom...”
“…”
“Oopssy Daisy!”
“Oh… For Merlin’s sake, Potter. Pull yourself together.”
"...”
“Here. Give me your hand.”
~*~*~*~*~
- 258 -
“So what happens now?” Harry asked, leaning against the bedpost. Both of them were back in their
original positions after returning from the bathroom. (An experience Harry would prefer to forget.)
Malfoy sighed. “What do you mean?”
“Tomorrow night. What happens when we find what we’re both looking for?”
Malfoy leaned his elbows on his knees and placed his head in his hands. His fingers scrunched
through his hair. “Exactly what was always going to happen.”
Harry breathed in deeply and then let it out long and slow. “I don’t want to fight you Malfoy.”
“It’ll happen anyway.”
The Slytherin glanced at the squat old clock on the mantelpiece. “Its time for you to leave.”
Harry looked at the hands that pointed to a quarter to twelve and shook his head and regretted it
instantly as it swam dangerously. “I’m staying.”
Malfoy stood up and looked down at Harry stonily. “No. You’re not.”
Harry closed his eyes briefly and then picked himself up off the floor. “Here.” He reached into his
pocket and pulled out a fistful of sweets, spilling some onto the floor.
Malfoy scowled and was about to say something when Harry finally removed the small crystal bottle
of purple-black liquid. Harry held it out for Malfoy to take.
Malfoy eyed it cautiously.
“It’s a healing potion. A health Tonic.” Harry explained.
Malfoy shook his head. “No.”
Harry shoved it into the Slytherin whose hands came around it automatically. “Take it. Seven drops
with water. I’ve been taking it for ages and it works brilliantly.”
“It doesn’t look like any healing potion I know.” Malfoy sneered at it. “Did you just throw it together
out of scraps?”
“No, it was made by a healer in Hogsmeade. She’s really gifted, Malfoy. Just… just trust me and use
it.”
The other boy pulled out the stopper and sniffed at it. He screwed his face up and then sniffed
again. He returned the stopper and held it out to Harry with a blank look on his face.
“What?”
“I’m not taking that.” The Slytherin said.
“Why not?”
“Its contains danomdipartite. Amongst other things.”
“So?”
“You don’t ingest danomdipartite if you like breathing.” Malfoy said tonelessly.
Harry frowned and took the bottle. "...But..."
“Tomorrow. A quarter to ten. Don’t be late.”
Harry replaced the bottle in his pocket. “Sure.”
- 259 -
As he headed back to the Gryffindor tower, Harry tried to think of a way that would make tomorrow
not as inevitable as Malfoy had said. But he couldn’t come up with a single way of avoiding the
confrontation that would follow, if not as soon as they had seen the memory, then as soon as they
found the Horcrux.
And it made Harry's already queasy stomach churn.
He didn’t want to fight Malfoy. Not like this.
The arguments and skirmishes they’d had in the past were going to be nothing compared to their
final battle. This time the stakes were much higher.
They were competing for the same short-term objective. Needing one another to achieve it, yet as
always, on opposing sides.
In the end, one of them would lose everything.
And one would claim the prize.
But at what price?
Harry decided that maybe this was a game neither of them could win.
~*~*~*~*~
27. Hermione's Parting
The Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff dining tables in the Great Hall were slowly shrinking. The Gryffindor
table however, seemed to be growing longer by the day. It now extended to almost half the length
it was when the school had its full intake, nearly doubling in size since the beginning of the school
year. Mealtimes had become a meeting place – a time to discuss anything that related to student
welfare and safety along with outside happenings that threatened their world as a whole. It seemed
the Gryffindor table was ‘the’ place to be if you wanted to know the latest happenings.
The students that belonged to the ever-increasing DA gathered at the back end of the table, while
those left (mostly the younger Gryffindor students and their friends) took up the front half. Amongst
the mix of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, was the odd Slytherin as well as most of the new
unassigned first years who ever since the discovery of the tunnel beneath Hogwarts had developed
the strategy of schooling together and hovering on the fringes of the largest crowds.
Sunday morning breakfasts were casual affairs, with students wafting in at their leisure, taking
advantage of the extra hours service, and drifting off again to make the most of the free day before
another week started.
Today the torches were all lit, spilling their yellowy light into the shadowed corners of the Hall as a
storm raged outside. Almost black clouds brimming with violet, billowed in the magical ceiling, while
outside they loomed over the castle and its surrounds, smothering sunlight and blanketing the Hall’s
windows so that it could have been dusk if not for the toasts and cereals lining the tables. The
thunder that rolled across the ancient stonework shook the panes and hummed through the tables,
making cutlery tinkle and liquids shimmy.
Harry sat staring at two runny poached eggs that trembled jelly-like on his plate.
“You look positively green.” Hermione scolded over the lingering rumble.
Harry’d already explained up in the common room to a concerned Hermione before coming down
why he was not really feeling like breakfast. At his tale of drinking half a bottle of firewhiskey with a
sottish Slytherin, she had dropped the worried frown, snorted unkindly and shuffled him out the
- 260 -
portrait hole ahead of her. Harry had thought this a bit harsh, as he’d stumbled down the stairways
and corridors dreaming longingly of crawling back into bed. When she had slid the plate containing
two poached eggs in front of him just after he had sat down, Harry suspected that Hermione’s
sadistic streak new no bounds in the punishment of the previously pinko’ed, since it appeared she
was actually trying to make him vomit.
“You could’ve come and got me last night.” Ron said sulkily. Reaching over he lifted a platter of
grilled tomatoes to his plate, taking three halves off and then setting it back down again. “Best
mates, Harry. We’re supposed to do that sort of thing together. Can’t believe you’d go down into
the dungeons alone to get stonkered with Malfoy. It should’ve been me.”
“Honestly.” Hermione tisked disapprovingly at Ron.
Harry pushed his plate away and looked up miserably. “I didn’t go down there to drink. It just sort
of… happened.”
Hermione turned her nose up slightly. “If you’re careless enough to get yourself into this state then
you deserve to suffer if you ask me.”
Harry frowned at her in annoyance as she swirled honey over her steaming porridge. He was ready
to admit that it was his own fault that his brain felt like it had turned into lead overnight, but he
suspected her total lack of sympathy was for Ron’s benefit more than his own. Maybe he would
have to re-think the whole ‘fringe benefits’ thing.
“That’s not very sympathetic.” Ron said sullenly, tipping bacon onto his plate enough for three
people.
“I give sympathy where it’s deserved.” Hermione said snootily. “I suppose you think it was funny.”
“If I’d been there it would’ve been.” Ron replied grimly. Looking at Harry he continued. “Malfoy
could’ve been planning to get you drunk, Harry. Maybe he’s hexed you and you can’t remember it.
Maybe it’s got a delayed effect and sometime later on today your nose will fall off.” Ron’s eyes grew
large as a thought occurred to him. He shoved the bacon dish onto the table distractedly, knocking
over the salt and peppershakers. “Maybe he slipped you a potion in your drink and that’s why you
look so green. Maybe you’ll go blue next because you can’t breathe–”
“We drank from the same bottle Ron.” Harry said calmly.
“Oh.” Ron relaxed and stuffed a chunk of tomato in his mouth.
“Harry…”
Harry cocked his head at Hermione’s warning tone wearily, expecting further disapproving
comments, but when his gaze met hers she was glaring at him, her spoon frozen in mid-scoop. She
glanced meaningfully in the direction of the front of the Hall so Harry followed her gaze. His
eyebrows shot up in pleasant surprise.
Easing into a chair at the teacher’s table, in between Hagrid (who was also just settling himself and
when did he get back?) and Professor Flitwick, was Julie.
Harry’s eyebrows lowered again almost immediately when he remembered Malfoy’s reaction to the
potion. His brow furrowed together as he reached into his jacket pocket and drew out the potion he
hadn’t bothered removing last night.
“Hermione? What’s danomdipartite?” He asked cautiously. He hadn’t told either of his friends what
Malfoy had said about the potion because he didn’t really know if he could take the Slytherin’s word
for it. After all, Julie had performed amazing healing on Harry’s wounds after his run-in with
Greyback. Why heal someone you’re only interested in poisoning?
Hermione, who had been shooting furtive glances at Ron, just waiting for him to notice Julie,
creased her brow thoughtfully for a moment before answering. “I don’t know. Can’t say as I’ve ever
heard of it. Why?”
- 261 -
Harry leaned forward and held out the dark purple potion for Hermione to take. She frowned, set
her spoon down and took the bottle from him.
“That’s the tonic I’ve been taking that Julie gave me.” Harry said. “I offered it to Malfoy last night
because he looks so ill, but he gave it back to me. He said it contained danomdipartite and that he
wouldn’t take it because he liked breathing too much.”
Hermione’s eyes grew wide and Ron’s fork clattered against his plate loudly where it had dropped.
“Whu?” Ron muffled out through egg and toast.
Harry shrugged in an effort to look like he wasn’t that bothered. “He could be wrong. I can’t imagine
Julie trying to poison me slowly when she’s had ample opportunity to do away with me at her place.
And anyway,” He continued casually. “If you’ve never heard of that stuff Hermione, then Malfoy’s
probably got it wrong. Maybe he was just trying to scare me?”
Hermione gave Harry a withered look. “Contrary to popular belief, I do not know everything. And as
far as potions go, Malfoy’s had enough help over the years as Snape’s pet to know what he’s talking
about. Probably.” She added. “Just because I haven’t heard of it doesn’t make it not real. It could
be a substance only used in dark magic. There must be loads of ingredients used in all sorts of
potions that aren’t in the books we have here. I mean, look at Horcruxes. I couldn’t find that in the
libr–” She stopped suddenly and narrowed her eyes at the dark liquid. “…brary.” She finished
quietly, turning the crystal bottle around in her hand thoughtfully.
“What?” Harry asked.
“Mmm?”
“C’mon Hermione.” Ron said, slightly irritated. “You always do this! You can’t just leave us hanging
when you’ve got something.”
“Oh, its nothing really.” She said distractedly, still eyeing the bottle. “I recently acquired some
reading material that might help.”
“Where from?” Ron asked interestedly. “I thought you said you didn’t get out much over the
holidays?”
“What?” Hermione finally dragged her gaze from the potion. “Oh… No. Well I didn’t. Sir gave me
some extra reading material.” She frowned again and leaned across to Harry. “I’ll see if I can find
anything but in the meantime, I can give this to Meredith from the DA if you like? She helps Ginny
with her Potions homework. Her parents apparently design a number of the potions they sell in their
apothecaries, and she works in the labs with them over the holidays so she must be fairly
knowledgeable.” She slipped the bottle into her jacket pocket. “I really think it’s worth checking it
out. The meaning of the name alone makes me–”
“What the bloody hell is she doing here?”
Harry swung his head to follow Ron’s threatening gaze and realized with a sinking feeling what his
best friend was glaring at. Hermione sighed wearily as Harry brought his gaze back to meet Ron’s.
This was why Hermione was so anxious about Julie’s presence. Ron may have forgiven Harry once
they had escaped Voldemort, not surprising after what they had been through together, but he had
no reason at all to make friendly with Julie.
“I have no idea.” Harry replied dully.
“Maybe you can ask her.” Hermione said casually, lifting a spoonful of porridge to her mouth. “She’s
on her way over right now.”
“What?” Ron’s head spun back to the direction of the teacher’s table and sure enough, Julie was
coasting up the aisle between the tables, heading straight for Harry. Ron narrowed his eyes and
Harry slunk further down in his seat. All he needed now was for Ginny to come along to complete
- 262 -
this increasingly gloomy morning. A low gurgle of thunder tumbled overhead ominously as Julie
stopped beside Harry, flashing all three of them a bright smile.
“Harry. How are you?” She took in his greenish pallor, knitting her eyebrows together as Harry
fumbled with words.
“Er… um, good. I'm Well. Um… How are you?”
“You don’t look well.” Julie raised an eyebrow dubiously. She glanced at his plate of untouched
eggs. “Not eating again, I see?” She rested her hand on his shoulder, gently squeezing it. “How long
have you been feeling ill again?”
“Er… its nothing. Really.” Harry cringed inwardly. “Its just this morning and… I’m feeling better than
I did when I woke up.”
“Hello.”
Oh no.
Harry closed his eyes briefly at the sound of Ginny’s voice.
This day, it seemed, could only get worse.
He turned reluctantly to face his girlfriend who was standing behind him.
Julie removed her hand.
Ron and Hermione watched on in awed anticipation.
“Ginny.” He reached out his hand to her in a gesture he had performed many times and was mildly
surprised when she smiled dreamily down at it and chuckled, placing her own hand in his
tentatively, yet enthusiastically. He squeezed it gently in a reassuring way but it seemed he needn’t
have worried. She sat herself down demurely next to Harry, grinning at their joined hands.
Mrs. Weasley, who had entered the Hall with McGonagall, patted the Headmistress’ arm in farewell
and headed for Julie.
“Well now.” She said, smiling kindly at Julie. “Minerva tells me you will be taking Potions for the rest
of the year Julie?”
“What?” Harry choked out.
Hermione made a strangled noise in her throat and Ron dropped his fork again.
“Yes. That’s right.” Julie said pleasantly. “And I’ll be teaching Healing charms in the Great Hall when
time allows.”
“A good thing too. Minerva knows what she’s doing. Best to have even children trained these days.”
Mrs. Weasley then gave Ron and Ginny a pointed stare. “Both of you pay close attention to what
Miss Pathet has to say. There’s few better when it comes to healing charms.” She motioned loosely
with her hand. “These two are mine. You let me know if they give you any trouble. Ginny’s my
youngest, and that there’s–”
“We’ve met.” Ron cut in icily, glaring at Julie.
“Yes, we have.” Julie agreed with a smile. Mrs Weasley looked surprised at Ron’s obvious dislike.
“Well, don’t let me keep you. Have a nice breakfast Molly. Harry?” Harry rubbed Ginny’s hand with
his thumb before releasing it and reluctantly meeting Julie’s gaze. “I would like you to stop by the
potions classroom later. I’ll be working in there most of the day. Anytime that’s convenient for you
will be fine.”
- 263 -
“What for?” Harry asked before he could stop himself.
She had turned to leave and hesitated at his words. “Oh. Our business is of a somewhat … personal
nature.”
Harry’s stomach fell through the floor. It was almost as if he could feel the soil piling up around him
as Julie dug his hole. He nodded nervously, ready to agree to anything so that Julie would stop
talking and leave. He watched as she finally walked away, and then hazarded a look at Ginny.
His fiery girlfriend was busy arranging her scrambled eggs on her plate in the form of a face, with
two huge grilled tomato-halves as eyes, a small chipolata sausage for a nose, and a crispy curved
bacon strip as its smiling mouth. When it was all in place she cocked her head to admire her handy
work.
“Um … Ginny?” Harry asked hesitantly. She didn’t look up immediately, just took out her wand and
pointed it at the plate. Harry, Ron and Hermione all flinched expecting the food to blow up or
incinerate or worse. Instead the breakfast face started chuckling. She smiled dreamily back at it and
then she seemed to pick up on Harry watching her and raised her eyebrows expectantly in his
direction.
“What are you doing?”
“I felt like happy food this morning.” She smiled easily as if it was the most natural thing in the
world to say. “Storms can be so dreary, don’t you think?”
Her breakfast chuckled again and Harry couldn’t stop the broad grin that crossed his face or the
small laugh that escaped his lips as relief surged through him. He completely forgot that Mrs
Weasley was there and leant sideways and plucked a soft lingering kiss from her lips. Ginny stayed
with her lips puckered and her eyes closed for a long moment, even after Harry pulled back, as if
savouring it for all it was worth. When she opened her eyes and looked straight into Harry’s
enquiring gaze she giggled shyly and then picked up her cutlery and stabbed one of the tomato
eyes on her plate. She popped it into her mouth and chewed it with a large dopey grin on her face.
Harry smiled and chuckled softly to himself and grabbed a piece of toast from the rack, suitably
relieved that Ginny seemed completely uncaring at the turn of events and feeling rather smug about
Ginny’s reaction to his kiss.
Hermione had watched all of this with narrowed eyes.
~*~*~*~*~
“Pansy! Can I walk with you?”
Pansy was on the third floor near the transfiguration classrooms, mid-way through her rounds when
Harry had finally spotted her after leaving the Great Hall. She eyed him suspiciously as he caught
up with her, but didn’t say anything, only continued along the passageway, her eyes darting this
way and that, occasionally lifting the corner of a tapestry or poking a suit of armour with her wand
to check that it sounded hollow. Harry walked beside her, watching her and thinking that she was
indeed very thorough in her duties.
She stopped suddenly and turned her attention on Harry, her lips pouted and an eyebrow raised
challengingly.
“It was that stupid elf, wasn’t it?” She crossed her arms defiantly. Harry raised both eyebrows,
caught off guard by her question. “It told you even after I gave it orders not to!”
- 264 -
“I made Dobby tell me.” Harry said finally. “And if you seek any sort of retribution on him you’ll
have me to deal with. Is that clear?” He asked warningly.
She sniffed, tilting her head and looking down her stubby little nose at him. “I have no intentions of
punishing him. He’ll take care of that all by himself. Lucius Malfoy had him exceedingly well
trained.”
“It’s a wonder Dobby feels any sympathy for people like you.” Harry frowned. “After the way your
lot treated him he should have been happy to leave Malfoy to his fate.”
“It just goes to show then, doesn’t it?” Pansy said lightly. “Perhaps you don’t know as much as you
think you do.”
“What is there to know? Oh. Don’t tell me.” Harry said sarcastically. “Draco deserves Dobby’s
sympathy because he was always so kind to the house elf, right?”
“Hardly.” She replied. “Draco learned from the best after all. No. He was never kind. That creature
and others like it are not worth the effort of kindness. Most of them wouldn’t appreciate it anyway.
So why waste your time?”
“That’s just wrong on so many levels. You’re lucky Hermione isn’t around to hear you say that.”
“Like I care what that muggle thinks.”
“She’s a witch, just like you.”
Pansy balled her fists up. “She’s nothing like me – or any of the other pure-blooded witches in this
school. She’s never had to choose sides. She doesn’t have to worry when she returns home that her
own family might be the enemy. She won’t be looking over her shoulder and wondering if her
parents are looking at her like that because they suspect she’s not willing to take the Mark when
she graduates. She won’t be lying awake at night waiting for the bedroom door to swing open with
her father or brother or worse standing there in a Death Eater mask because someone has fingered
you as a risk.” She was bordering on hysterical as her eyes glistened with moisture.
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say. Stung by her words he just stared at her as she continued.
“You ‘precious ones’ think everything is black and white – good and evil – and nothing in-between.
Well Slytherins know better. You think we don’t notice that people sneer at us just because we wear
Silver and Green?” Pansy said bitterly. “Is it any wonder that we don’t play nicely with the other
children? We're forced to make choices on our own because nobody but Professor Snape ever
looked out for us!”
“But M-Malfoy took the mark willingly.” Harry stumbled awkwardly. “He was proud of it ... Pleased
even ... I heard him on the train...”
“You heard him bragging to his peers, Potter! Just maybe that ridiculous little elf knows Draco a
little better than you! Ask yourself why a crazy little elf like that would care about what happens to
him. And while you’re at it, ask yourself why Draco took the Mark so young, why don’t you? But
maybe you don't want to know that much about him. Maybe its easier to keep him labelled with the
tag you were so quick to slap on him in the beginning." She huffed and jutted an accusing finger at
him. "I would have thought you’d have learned something about him last night.”
She saw the surprise on Harry’s face and dropped her shoulders exasberatedly.
“Oh of course I know about it. He didn't tell me what went on but he said you didn't fight." She let
out a weary breath and lowered her gaze. " I thought maybe that would’ve helped you to see.
Helped you to realize.”
Harry worked his jaw, feeling decidedly uncomfortable. Being put in your place by Pansy Parkinson
was not an experience he ever thought he'd suffer. Not knowing how to respond he decided to go
on the offensive.
- 265 -
“How long have you known he’s here?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Not long. But long enough.”
“And yet you didn’t bother to inform the DA–”
“I couldn’t care less about your little vigilante group, to be honest.”
Harry faltered. “Huh?”
“I’m only there so I know what’s going on – that’s all.”
“But… you’re here… checking the passageways.”
“Because my darling Draco needs me to.” Pansy said smoothly. “You didn’t really think I was doing
it for you?”
“I thought … for the DA. For all of the students.” Harry said, mildly disgusted.
“No.” She said simply. “Only for Draco. He needs me to keep an eye on things while he’s…
indisposed.”
“You know, you’re not helping your case for Slytherins here. You do realize how bloody selfish that
sounds! Why the hell would I trust people like you when you’ve got that sort of attitude?”
“You know, Draco’s been close to killing you more times than you can imagine.”
Harry’s breath hitched at the careless ease with which Pansy spoke.
“But he’s never actually done it, has he? Not once in the whole time he’s been here has he even
attacked you. He could have. Loads of times. When you were down by the lake all by your lonesome
and he was standing right behind you and there was no one to see. Even then, he didn’t do
anything.
“My Draco is not the enemy underfoot you should be focusing on.” She added snootily, not meeting
his eye.
Harry’s nose crinkled in question. “What d'you mean?”
Pansy sighed dramatically. “I’m not going to stick my neck out for you, Potter.”
“You’re in the DA Pansy.” Harry pointed out. “It's not like you can hide that for long. Not now we
have so many members.”
“I’m not trying to hide it.” She said indignantly, placing her hands on her hips. “I’m in the perfect
position to spy right where I am.”
Harry scoffed. “For who?”
“For either side. It's perfect.” She shrugged. “It was Draco’s idea, after all.”
“What?” Harry blurted.
“Oh don’t get your wand in a knot!” She said dramatically. “I’m not actually spying on you, it just
looks that way. It'd be pretty thick to tell you about it otherwise, don't you think? No. This way I
can be alerted to any unexpected visitors to Hogwarts and keep an eye on Bl....” Her straying eyes
flashed with fear and she stopped herself sharply.
“Who? Who are you keeping–”
“Blaise!” Pansy interrupted Harry loudly, peering over his shoulder. Harry turned to see Blaise
strolling up behind him.
- 266 -
“Pansy.” Blaise said smoothly, coming to a stop. “What are you doing here still? You’re going to be
late for our study session if you don’t get a move on.” His eyes darted between the two of them in
suspicion, narrowing ever so slightly.
“Oh do drag me away from this boorish Gryffindor, Blaise.” Pansy sighed exaggeratedly, all traces of
uncertainty gone. “Its not enough that I’m doing my share, he has to come up and start criticizing
how I do it!”
“I did not–”
“Come on, darling.” Pansy cut Harry's indignant denial off, grabbing Blaise’s arm and tugging him
along with her. “I get no appreciation, Blaise. No love.” She pulled Blaise up the corridor leaving
Harry staring after them in bewilderment.
~*~*~*~*~
Ron accosted Harry just outside the common room as he was on his way back. Ron was carrying his
winter cloak over one arm and was out of breath and mildly panicky.
“Harry. We have to go. Now.” He said, grabbing Harry’s arm.
“What’s happened?” Harry asked quickly as he allowed Ron to lead him speedily down the stairs.
“Hermione’s gone to meet him. To call it all off.” He panted. “You promised we’d follow her. I don’t
trust him Harry.”
Realizing Ron was talking about Hermione and Zach he said. “Oh." And then added. "Don’t you think
you’re over reacting a bit?” Just then he was shoved unceremoniously into the second floor shortcut
to the main stairs by a pushy Ron. “I mean Hermione’s handled him pretty well so far.”
“Ginny said he wouldn’t let Hermione do it by owl. Kept insisting she meet him. Why?" He asked
forcefully. " Why would he want to meet with her if he was going to take this well?”
They came out at the top of the marble staircase on the first floor. Harry stumbled forward as Ron
nudged him out of the hidden recess. A clap of thunder crashed overhead, echoing loudly through
the high ceilinged Hall.
“Well, it is a bit impersonal … isn’t it?” Harry offered calmly. “Owl, I mean. Its not exactly a
'sensitive' way to break-up, is it?”
“Harry. If it was no big deal why didn’t she tell us she was going?” Ron threw Harry’s coat at him
and started down the stairs to the Entrance Hall talking over his shoulder. "She's too bloody proud.
That's her trouble!"
Harry pulled his coat awkwardy over his shoulders as he followed.
The sky outside was deep shades of grey and purple, and hard heavy rain lashed at Harry as he
closed the huge entrance door behind him. The rain did not seem to slow Ron down in the slightest
however. He was racing across the grounds to the gate as if pursued by a dragon. He was already
muttering the password and flicking his wand at the chains that bound the gate by the time Harry
joined him.
“Where are we going?” Harry asked as they slipped through and relocked the entrance.
“The Three Broomsticks. Ginny said ... that's where she's meeting him.” Ron answered breathlessly
and then he disappeared with a pop. Harry sighed and followed.
- 267 -
He arrived outside the pub just in time to see Ron disappear inside it. Harry opened the door and
entered the familiar cosy warmth already uncomfortably wet from his brief time in the rain.
Before he knew what was happening he was enveloped by a blast of hot wind that gushed and
blustered all around him, taking his breath away. It stopped after only few seconds and Harry
looked about him in confusion. A wrinkly old wizard dressed in shabby khaki robes sat in a padded
chintz armchair near the door holding his wand in hand, pointing it at Harry. A crooked, toothless
smile slanted his face as he looked at Harry’s cloak.
Harry looked down and patted himself and realized he was bone dry.
The old wizard wheezed a cackle at his surprise. Harry began searching his pockets, hoping that he
had some money stashed somewhere, but the wizard shook his head and poked his thumb in the
direction of Madame Rosmerta.
“Taken care of, lad.” He rasped. Harry nodded and thanked him and began his search for Hermione
and Zach.
He spotted Ron unsuccessfully trying to ‘covertly’ work his way around the room. The boy knocked
someone’s drink all down it's owner and trod on more than one foot in his ‘stealthy’ efforts of trying
not to bring attention to himself. Harry turned away to hide his smirk.
The pub was almost full as it was near lunchtime, and Sunday lunches were always a big draw
because of Happy Hour. When Harry and Ron finally stopped, neither had seen any sign of
Hermione or Zach.
“I’ll ask Rosmerta.” Ron said with a worried frown. Harry nodded and Ron went up to the bar, leant
over it and spoke to the innkeeper. She smiled broadly at him when she saw Ron and then nodded
her head and pointed to an empty two-seater corner table. Then she shook her head and motioned
to the door. Ron turned quickly and made his way back to Harry.
“They’ve left.” He said, looking paler than usual. “They walked off without apparating.”
Harry frowned. “Where would they go in this weather?”
“You tell me.” Ron replied, the worry etched on his face. Harry gripped his arm gently.
“We’ll find her. Don’t worry. C’mon.” Harry led Ron back to the door. “Hang on.” He pulled up short
and turned to face Ron. Digging under his cloak, he slipped his wand out of the pocket of his jeans
and waved it over Ron. “Impervious Charm.” Harry explained, and then turned the wand on himself.
He waved it and then slipped it back under his cloak. “Let’s go.”
Once back out on the street they decided it would be better to split up and cover more ground
faster. Harry headed out towards the Shrieking Shack with the aim of circling round to meet Ron
back outside the pub in twenty minutes. As he trudged along in the rain, which fell all around him
and not on him thanks to the charm, he began to worry in earnest.
Why would Hermione leave the comfort of The Three Broomsticks and come out in this? She was far
too sensible a girl to do something like that lightly, so what had brought her out here?
A sudden gust of wind whipped his coat up, and Harry shivered. Partly from the cold blast, but
mostly because Ron’s foreboding intuition about Hermione’s break-up with Zach was now creeping
through Harry’s veins like ice.
Harry quickened his pace, scanning the cobbled streets carefully. Lightening forked across the sky
as he neared the edge of town and a clap of thunder broke loudly above him. Harry’s worry was
turning to dread as the minutes ticked by with no sign of Hermione. It was possible that she had
already returned to Hogwarts, but something told Harry that she hadn’t. That she was out here
somewhere and in need of him and Ron. Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a flash of
light somewhere in the distance to his right. It was low on the horizon, rising above the housetops
instead of illuminating the sky.
- 268 -
Harry broke into a run.
He circled the last house at the end of the street before the forest took over and bolted down the
path that took him past trees on one side and streets on the other.
Another flash of light rose from the trees ahead.
Harry clumsily dug for his wand under his cloak, but it was impossible to get to it under the heavy
garment unless he slowed down or stopped. Another flash – this one green – and Harry abandoned
his try for the wand and broke into a sprint.
As he neared he could make out three figures draped in black standing around another slumped
body on the ground. Harry tried to pull up before he ran straight into them and gave himself away
but skidded on the muddy sopping grass and slid along the ground on his hip before finally coming
to a halt in a bush.
He scrambled to pull his wand out and get up at the same time but he slipped again, nosediving into
the mud. He swore loudly in frustration and ripped at his cloak. It fell away as he stumbled to his
feet, his hand swiftly grabbing his wand from his jeans. The impervious charm had dissipated on
contact with the ground when he had fallen and the rain pelted into his lenses obscuring his vision.
The figures ahead were a blur, but he could make out one of them lifting the limp body off the
ground. Harry pushed forward and fired a stun that hit his target, flinging the Death Eater
backwards and sending the body in his arms flying.
Another figure with light coloured hair was screaming at Harry and pointing frantically. Then spells
were being flung at Harry from an impossible number of directions as he tried to turn. Unable to do
anything else, he launched himself onto the ground, ducking the ribbons of light that laced above
him. Some hit surrounding trees and exploded, sending splintering wood showering down on Harry.
But he didn’t have time to worry about the sudden stabbing pain in his shoulder. He clawed his way
off the ground again and scrambled towards the body that had been thrown clear by his stun, when
suddenly something brought him crashing to his knees. Collapsing under an enormous weight Harry
was pushed forward and pinned flat to the ground. All the air left his lungs under the crushing force
and specks of light darted into his eyesight as he slowly and painfully lifted his head.
Voices muffled by the storm exchanged unknown words around Harry’s prone form. He realized he
was only meters from the Death Eater he had knocked out with his stun as several pairs of black
boots crossed his field of vision, slapping in the muddy, rain soaked grass. The Death Eater was
beginning to slowly and stiffly pick himself up off the ground, and only a short distance from him
was the limp body he had been holding. This close Harry could see the sodden and muddied long
brown hair and Weasley jumper poking through the torn cloak.
“Hermione.”
It came out as barely a whisper and Harry’s heart clenched and ached and suddenly everything felt
wrong.
He gritted his teeth, putting everything he had into moving. To getting up and going to her anyway
he could. He tried to push up, but even though his arms were right there on the ground either side
of his head his brain couldn’t seem to find them to use them and as he strained, blackness
swamped the edges of his vision threateningly. He ignored the warning and summoned every nerve
and muscle he could to get on his feet, but his arms still didn't move and with dawning
understanding, Harry realized couldn’t even feel his legs.
The blonde who had been screaming at Harry was lying on his back in the mud a few feet away with
his arms folded over his face and weeping whole-heartedly. Then his arms dropped away as he
rolled onto his side and hugged himself, curling his knees up tightly into his chest.
Zacharias anguished eyes closed tightly as he continued to sob.
Harry’s neck burned with the strain of keeping his head up but he had to watch. He had to.
- 269 -
The Death Eater in front of him had finally found his feet and was walking the few paces to
Hermione’s still form. He bent down to gather her up and as he slid his arms under her body his
now unmasked face came into Harry’s limited field of view.
Harry roared in frustration and fury, but with next to no air in his lungs all that came out was an
inaudible groan, smothered by the pounding, relentless rain. Harry watched, unable to do anything
as Snape lifted Hermione and then turned to face the other Death Eaters. He said something Harry
couldn’t pick up and then Harry felt a pull, and sharp seering pain forked through his right shoulder.
He tried to respond but all that came out was a broken grunt.
He was rapidly losing his battle to stay conscious. His eyes dropped closed as his head sagged.
The voices were talking again but were interrupted by a loud yell that came from somewhere in the
distance.
Snape barked out an order and Harry heard several loud cracks and he knew beyond a doubt,
without having to look, that Hermione was gone.
Zach’s wailing sobs droned on relentlessly and then Harry heard Ron's voice calling to him.
Harry clinged to consciousness.
He had failed Ron. He had failed Hermione. He’d let them take her and he wanted to tell Ron how
sorry he was. How desperately and sickeningly sorry he was.
The pain seemed to be growing in intensity as he tried to draw breath.
His head finally dropped cheek first back into the mud, the strength to hold it up no longer in him.
Ron yelled his name frantically again, sounding almost on top of him, and then ... a hand touched
his face hesitantly.
Harry dragged his eyes open and met Ron’s pale, strained and scared face looking down at him.
“I’m so sorry.” Harry breathed.
Then he sank into darkness.
~*~*~*~*~
28. Revelations
Harry didn’t feel like moving and he wasn’t really sure if he was awake, asleep or dead. He seemed
to be lying on a cushioned surface on his stomach and his cheek was pushed into what could have
been a pillow. Jumbled up nightmare images flashed through his head as grim murmurs slowly
drifted into his hearing.
“…Poppy. Are you saying that the sap was trying to liquefy his muscles?”
“Nasty stuff Minerva, and hard to recognise according to Professor Sprout. The Eucapatholyptus
looks exactly like a harmless Blood-wood. I dread to think what would have happened if she hadn’t
been up here when he was brought in.”
“How did Pomona know what it was?”
“One of the two fellows that helped Mr. Weasley bring him back’d already removed quite a vicious
curse that had Potter pinned to the ground, but nothing he cast helped Potter’s paralysis. When I
asked about the wound in his shoulder the Professor noticed the splinters in his clothing. He was
hardly breathing by then.”
- 270 -
Harry tried to open his eyes as the murmuring voices echoed over him lingeringly, but nothing
happened. Not even a fluttering of eyelids.
“The shard entered his shoulder… just there. See? It was pulled out rather roughly going by the
tear, though nobody seems to know by whom. If it’d stayed in there any longer he would have been
beyond my aide. He will need complete bed rest, of course. For the next few days at least.”
“You are aware of how difficult that will be under the circumstances?”
“Mm, yes. Unfortunately I am quite well acquainted with Mr. Potter’s… determination.”
Groggily, Harry tried to move, to roll over in an effort to ease the ache in his limbs, but it wasn’t
just his eyes that didn’t work. Not even a finger lifted off the bed.
“How long will the antidote take to work through his system?”
“He’ll be a bit wobbly on his feet for a time, but he’s breathing normally already. He should be able
to make it to the bathroom and back but not much further than that for a few days, I’m afraid.”
“What about Smith?”
“Heavily sedated until we can get two coherent words out of him.” Harry felt the mattress lift
slightly on one side as a sheet was drawn up and tucked in. “The Ministry’s hounds will be back
tomorrow to question him fully. Its hard to believe a young man like that would lead poor Miss
Granger into…”
“Yes. Well we do not have all the facts yet, Poppy. I imagine there is more to this than what Mr.
Weasley has so far informed.”
As thoughts of Hermione bombarded him, Harry tried to push out some of the sickening pressure
building in him. It would likely come out as an awful groan and Harry wouldn’t have cared. Any
sound would have been a release, helping him to escape this waking prison he found himself in. But
nothing, not even a whisper passed his lips. His whole insides were swirling with anger, frustration,
and sorrow slowly rotting inside him.
“I would have worried about Smith’s safety tonight except for the fact I gave young Ronald
something to calm him before I sent him off as well. I’ve never seen a student look so murderous–”
“Thank you, Poppy. I believe Mr. Weasley was … very close … to Miss Granger. She was … an
exceptional … young woman.”
McGonagall’s voice sounded strangled and Harry started to lose grip on whatever it was that had
woken him.
“I must be going, Poppy. I do not like to leave but some things will not wait. … I will notify the
Grangers … before I leave for the Ministry. You will be able to handle things here until I return?”
Harry registered McGonagalls anguished tone at contacting Hermione’s parents and guilt forked
through him like lightening. It was his fault she was gone. He had been so busy worrying about
Ginny being a target that he had neglected to watch out for his other two highest priorities. Ron and
Hermione. His Hermione. And now she was gone. Sweet kind compassionate lovingly loyal
impossibly bossy and always right Hermione.
Best friend for ever Hermione.
How could he have let this happen…
“He’s out of danger Minerva. Don’t worry, neither of them will be going anywhere this evening.”
Harry no longer wanted to hold on. To think about how she had slipped so violently away from him.
Because of him. He let go and felt himself fall. Footsteps faded into nothing.
- 271 -
~*~*~*~*~
… Potter …
Harry was dreaming of rain. So much rain, that he could no longer see the ground, just a dark
ocean and grey storm clouds. The murky water pooled around his thighs as large blobs continued to
fall. The droplets dented the surface causing rippling ringlets to expand and collide in a never-
ending cycle. Harry wondered if he too was made of water.
The tips of his fingers swirled lazy patterns through the spitting swelling, volumous surface, as he
stood not moving, just watching the water rise. He thought about how peaceful it would be to just
stand there and let the water keep coming. To let it swathe him. Envelop him.
He watched as it bloomed higher and higher. Maybe when it covered him completely it would finally
shut out the awful sobbing that persistently echoed around him.
“…Potter…”
Harry ignored the intruder to this grey, wet and empty place where he didn’t have to think about
anything except the rain.
Warm wet salty rain.
He lifted his face to the weeping haze and closed his eyes, concentrating on the feeling of the water
seeping up his body. It was up to his elbows and he let it keep coming. Willed it to come.
As the rain sprinkled onto his face he slowly became aware that he was leaking. He looked down
and saw salty water seeping through his shirt and running in rivulets down his chest. At the same
moment … he realized the incessant sobbing had stopped.
“Potter!”
Harry opened his eyes. The second he did he wished he had let the water take him. He was lying on
his back in the comfort and safety of the dimly lit hospital wing at Hogwarts and it was wrong. It
was so wrong. Like everything since… since…
He closed his eyes again and sucked in a breath.
“Don’t you dare go back to sleep!”
Harry knew that voice and the acidic tone with which it spoke.
“Sod off Malfoy.” He croaked as he rested an arm over his eyes.
“Oh. No. You. Don’t!”
The blanket that was covering Harry’s only half pyjama clad form was yanked off the bed and the
cool night air settled on him like a cold hand across his chest. Stiffly Harry rolled onto his side and
curled his knees up.
He had no idea how the Slytherin had got into the hospital ward, and didn’t care to know, but he did
know why the other boy was there, and Harry found he no longer cared about that either. He closed
his eyes to the outside, unconcerned if he never opened them again.
“Potter. Get up!” Malfoy whispered hoarsely as he walked around the bed until he was standing in
front of Harry.
- 272 -
Harry ignored the Slytherin but Hermione’s accusing, lifeless form seemed burned into the back of
his eyelids and with a sinking feeling, he decided he couldn’t look at it anymore. He opened his eyes
slowly, scowling at his own cowardice, and stared blankly at nothing in front of him.
An impatient huff came from Malfoy. “Its already past ten. We have to get moving.”
Harry didn’t move.
Nothing he did made anything better. Maybe if he stayed here and didn’t move at all then his
friends would be safe. Maybe if he stayed here long enough he wouldn’t have any friends to worry
about keeping safe.
Maybe then no one else would have to die.
One of the hospital wings metal chairs was scraped noisily into view. Malfoy then threw an
invisibility cloak over one of its arms and dropped into it. He lifted a knee to rest his foot up on the
edge of Harry’s bed before sprawling back and raking a hand through his hair in a nervous gesture.
He was quiet for a moment before letting out a deep sigh. Harry’s gaze was drawn to him long
enough to take in the Slytherin green pullover and black pants the boy was clad in and the weary,
uncertain look on his face. Harry looked away to stare at nothing again.
“I hope this isn’t going to take long.” Malfoy deadpanned. “I have plans at midnight.”
Harry almost closed his eyes again at Malfoy’s attempt at humour. But the fact that the Slytherin
tried to make light of the pain the boy suffered nightly only tugged at the pit of his stomach. Only
the thoughts of seeing her again kept them open. He was so tired of the pain – of his own, and of
everyone else’s.
“Look.” Malfoy sighed again and looked up at the ceiling uncomfortably. “Neither of us is any good
at this Potter. So why don’t we skip the part where I act convincingly like I care, bypass the whole
woeful outpouring of Gryffindor sentimentality that, Merlin forbid, we both know I don’t have a hope
of tolerating without taking the mickey, and you just come right out and tell me exactly what it’ll
take to get you off that bed and out of the dump of self pity you are currently wallowing in. Because
– quite frankly – it’s boring and it's selfish and I don’t have the bloody time for it.”
Harry should have felt mild shock and would normally be affronted at Malfoy’s words, and yet he
remained unmoved. It was going to take a lot more than Malfoy’s lack of tact to pierce his
numbness.
It must have become clear to Draco that Harry had no intention of continuing on with their plans
tonight, because the Slytherin’s casual façade shattered suddenly. He kicked out his foot; jarring
the bed Harry was lying on and sending his chair skidding backwards. Harry was jolted out of his
revere while Malfoy leapt to his feet and lunged forward, grabbing Harry’s arm and yanking the
wary-eyed Gryffindor up to bring their faces within inches of each other.
“You pick tonight of all nights to give up!” Draco hissed through his teeth. He searched Harry’s face
impatiently and then tightened his grip. “I know what you need Potter. Revenge.”
Before Harry could gather his wits he was thrust backward onto the bed again. Malfoy turned and
stalked away. Harry lifted himself onto his elbows with difficulty, still incredibly stiff and sore from
the poisonous sap and watched as the Slytherin stopped beside a bed some way down and
opposite. The angry blonde drew his wand and pointed it at the unconscious sandy haired Hufflepuff
that lay oblivious in the sheets.
“No!” Harry croaked out, not at all certain what Malfoy had in store for Smith. He thought he ought
to keep the seething Slytherin from doing something that Harry would surely regret.
Malfoy looked over his shoulder disgustedly at Harry. “He has to pay for what he did. It’s the only
way you’ll be free of that pointless and emasculating guilt that you’re infested with.” The Slytherin
reached forward and grabbed a fist full of Sandy hair, yanking the other boy’s head up so he was in
a sitting position. He snarled at Harry. “And if you won’t do it, I will. I need you on your feet
- 273 -
tonight, Potter. I cannot afford you to be weakened by self loathing and pity.”
Then suddenly a yellow flash darted from Malfoy’s wand and Smith gasped in a breath of air,
clutching at his chest, his eyes remaining eerily closed.
Harry swung himself onto the side of his bed, ignoring the sharp pains coming from his stiff limbs.
“What did you do?” He demanded.
Smith sagged again, the weight of his torso only being held up by Malfoy’s grip on his hair.
“A little pick me up. Guaranteed to break through most common sedatives.” Draco eyed Smith with
interest. “It’s a tad painful, bit of a shock to the system, but nothing a pure-blooded traitor like
Smith here couldn’t handle.” Malfoy pulled Smiths head up higher and grinned malevolently as it
hung forward. “Dear oh me, some people just can’t get up in the mornings.”
Before Harry verbally protested, he was wincing at the effects of another yellow flash Malfoy sent
Smiths way. Smith’s eyes flew wide open and he drew in a rattled breath that sounded like it could
be his last, his arms still clutched at his chest. Harry suspected the only thing keeping Smith from
falling backwards onto the bed was Malfoy’s unyielding grasp of his hair.
“Malfoy! Let him go.” Harry ground out, finally managing to work his way off the edge of the bed
onto his feet.
“You don’t need to worry about being found out. I put a silencing charm on the doors when Poopy
Pomphrey left. Oh Come on Potter. You know what he did as well as I do. I was here when they
were trying to mend you. He’s a traitor. A blood traitor but also a double-crosser who betrayed his
own side – hell, his own girlfriend – at the first sign of trouble.” Malfoy yanked Smiths head back so
the boys face was tilted towards him. Smith was panting and dazed from his rude awakening, and
growing more frightened by the second.
Malfoy’s lip curled dangerously in distaste as he moved in closer to the scared boy.
“Do you know what my side does to traitors?” The Slytherins voice hissed dark and threatening. Not
waiting for an answer he continued on slowly, relishing the other boys fear. “They peel the skin
from you body, layer by layer, magically so you don’t pass out from the pain and horror, and then
they just walk away and leave you.” Malfoy moved his head round so he was speaking with soft
venom into Smiths ear. Zach was shaking so badly the metal bars on the bed were rattling. “Do you
know why? Why they don’t torture you further? Because skin is the bodies largest organ, and when
it’s simply taken away, all of your other organs begin to shut down from shock.”
A change was slowly coming over the Slytherin as he spoke. The malicious bravado was gradually
being overcast with repulsion. “They say you can feel your outer flesh shrivelling as it dries out. But
not the face. A lipless mouth tends to drool rather a lot, and the salt in the tears that leak from raw,
sagging eyes, burns like acid as it drips. It’s slow and agonizing… And the worst suffering you can
imagine before you die…” Malfoy’s expression was laced with pain and bitterness as he trailed off.
Smith let out a whimper and squeezed his eyes tightly shut. Clear wet drops fell down his flushed
and anguished cheeks.
“Malfoy. That’s enough. Let him go.” Harry said croakily under his breath, sickened by what he had
just heard.
Malfoy glanced round at Harry and then back at the pitiful Smith and then he finally let the boy go,
his sneer plastered back in its usual place. Harry rested his full weight on his feet and stood for a
moment to get his balance. He took a tentative step to the bedside cabinet and grabbed his glasses
before pushing them up his nose and picking up his wand, feeling somewhat more secure in
Malfoy’s presence now it was in his hand. Then he turned slowly and began lifting himself back onto
the bed.
“What the hell are you doing? Why are you getting back into bed?”
Harry sighed and without meeting the incredulous stare he was sure to be getting from Malfoy, he
- 274 -
rearranged the bed covers and settled back against the propped up pillows.
“Potter!” Malfoy spat. “Did I not make myself clear? Shake off this quagmire you’re stuck in and hex
Smith until he’s the slobbering blob he deserves to be and you feel better. Then we can go.”
Smith made a keening noise.
“I’m not going anywhere Malfoy.” Harry pushed his hands up under his glasses and rubbed at his
eyes. “Don’t you get it? Hermione’s… They’re all dead or dying, and I don’t want … to know about it
anymore. I don’t want to… to be the cause … anymore.”
Zach started mumbling incoherently in the background, rocking back and forth on the bed, clutching
at himself as Malfoy advanced on Harry.
“You are a part of this whether you want to be or not. You always have been and always will! And
you’re not the only one so stop being so weak and pathetic.” The Slytherins face twisted angrily.
“You should count yourself lucky! Not all of us have a Secret Society and Ministry officials covering
our backs. I haven’t exactly been served a dish full of dancing Veelas either. But did I give up
when…” Malfoy stopped and struggled to get the words out. “When my mother died.”
Harry recognized that Malfoy wasn’t associating his mother’s death with the truth. Murder by
Voldemort. Maybe that’s how he managed to still serve his Dark Lord.
“Of course not!” The Slytherin continued. “And you. You’re The Chosen One.” He mocked with his lip
curled. “Oh… but of course. How terribly insensitive of me. It must be insufferable to have a world
full of hero worshippers fawning all over you and jumping to your every need. Over protective mobs
racing you off to the hospital wing whenever you do no more than stub your big toe. It must be the
absolute pits to have a world of people at your fingertips ready to help you – fight for you – take
you in and…” He mouthed without sound for a moment in search of more words and then said even
louder. “The difference between you and me is that they mistakenly see you as the saviour of the
wizarding world, while its people like me that are really trying to preserve it!”
Zach gave another whimper at Malfoy’s raised voice and continued to murmur something over and
over again that neither of them could understand. (Not that they were listening. They had both sunk
into eyeing each other off challengingly like they had habitually ended up doing since they were
eleven years old.)
“One day they’ll understand.” The Slytherin narrowed his eyes, his passion clearly visible. “One day
they’ll see what it means to allow fools like Dumbledore to make the rules. Muggles will never
accept wizards. They fear our magic, they fear our spoken word, and they even fear that we live
longer than them. Its jealousy – nothing nobler – and muggles destroy everything they fear and
envy. If we don’t do something now there’ll be no more wizards left to–”
“PUT A CORK IN IT MALFOY! ARE YOU SERIOUSLY SAYING THAT THAT CRAZED PSYCO TOM RIDDLE
– THE ONE THAT PUTS YOU THROUGH HELL NIGHT AFTER NIGHT – IS YOUR ANSWER?” Harry’s
outburst had surprised even himself, but he was so sick of hearing Malfoy’s oblivious hypocrisy.
“He’s the only one powerful enough to do anything about it.” The Slytherin said quietly, avoiding
Harry’s glare. “I trust Fathers judgment.”
“This would be the same Lucius Malfoy that placed a dangerous book into eleven year old Ginny
Weasley’s hands – a pureblood remember – so that the entire ‘impure’ student body could be
systematically wiped out? Only she told Riddle about me, didn’t she? And in his infinite wisdom he
was no longer content to just lie and manipulate Ginny and kill hundreds of kids – sorry –
mudbloods. He abandoned ‘the noble cause’ for consuming her soul, leaving her for dead so he
could have another go at me, a near-powerless twelve year old, all because he learned I had
somehow almost killed him when I was one.” Harry watched as Draco’s expression faltered into an
uncertain frown. “Funny how he can ignore his ‘noble calling’ without a second thought when he
thinks his own existence is under threat.”
Harry had Malfoy hooked. The Slytherin was listening in spite of himself. Harry continued, taking full
advantage of the moment.
- 275 -
“I don’t imagine he looks too kindly on his Death Eaters valuing their own lives as much. It’s
probably in some Death Eater handbook somewhere that you have to sacrifice yourself ‘honourably’
for your fellow pure-blooded comrades future glory. Still, I suppose it makes sense that Voldemort
wouldn’t have to hold to that – having a muggle father and all.” Harry heard the hiss from Malfoy
but continued on as if he hadn’t. “Of course Voldemort would like everyone to believe he’s warring
for pureblood supremacy, but that’s hardly likely since he’s a halfblood, don’t you think? But your
father must know all about it. He wouldn’t be gullible enough to commit his whole family into the
service of the darkest wizard of all time without being certain of Voldemorts agenda. Your father is
surely smart enough to know the real reason Voldemort needs his Death Eaters.”
Harry’s gaze drifted over Malfoy’s decidedly pale face. The Slytherin was frowning in quiet fury and
confusion, reflecting his inner turmoil as he stewed over what he had just been told. It was almost
enough to make Harry wish it wasn’t too late to care whether or not he’d made a difference.
“Anyway.” Harry said resignedly, pulling the blanket back around him. “You’ll forgive me if I don’t
want to hear any more of your Death Eater ‘Youth Training’. I don’t care about any of it anymore.”
This seemed to bring Draco out of his thoughts. He narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Of course you
care… or you wouldn’t be behaving like such a coward!”
“What?”
“You finally lose someone close to you and you-you can’t stomach it anymore!”
“F-Finally? …” Harry blustered in disbelief but he was not prepared to get into the long list of people
he’d lost so he went on the attack. “Hermione’s dead you sodding insensitive prat! DEAD! She died
because I couldn’t save her!” Oh no no no no no… Harry could feel the salty sting prickling at his
eyes and he did not want to do this in front of Malfoy. He whipped his glasses off and lifted his
palms up to his eyes. He was not ready to open these floodgates. Maybe he would never be ready.
Maybe if he started crying for Hermione, he’d never stop. Just drown in the tears like in his dream.
“It’s always the same story with you, isn’t it Potter? Oh what?” Malfoy bit out impatiently over his
shoulder as Zach’s mantra became more urgent. “What are you on about Smith?”
“She’s not d-dead.”
The Slytherin turned to face the distressed Hufflepuff. “The mudblood?”
Harry dropped his hands away from his face where they had been pressing in violently in an effort
to hold back his grief and stared at Zach.
“Sh-she’s not dead.” He stumbled out. “Just … knocked out.”
Harry slipped off the bed and began walking stiffly towards Zach, barely even registering the pain
caused by his movement. “But… but there was a green light. The killing curse … I saw it.”
“Snape.” Zach sobbed as Malfoy approached, watching on in interest. “One of them went to fire the
k-killing curse… at me …and he shot the wand out of their hand… just in time. It barely missed me.”
“Snape did that?” Malfoy demanded, frowning intently as the other boy nodded. “How do you know
it was him?”
“I didn’t – not for certain – until his mask came off when Harry hit him with a stun.”
Malfoy didn’t let up, now seeming as interested in what happened as Harry, who was temporarily
struck dumb, afraid to speak in case Hermione’s reprieve was broken.
“So Snape didn’t kill Granger but he took her with him?”
Zach nodded at Malfoy and wiped the back of his pyjama sleeve across his wet face, sucking in air
to catch his breath. “He stunned her. Knocked her out. He wouldn’t tell me why he wanted her,
just-just that I had to do as I was told or they’d come for my family next.”
- 276 -
“How did you get her out of The Three Broomsticks?” Harry asked grimly in a sudden need to know
the details. He finally allowed a tentative relief to wash through him.
The Hufflepuff had the decency to look ashamed. “Snape appeared at my house a week ago. He
said they knew about our relationship and that I was to insist on meeting with her to break it off.
Then he gave me something to put in her drink – a Confundus powder I think – and told me to lead
her to the forest out by Shady Lane.”
Malfoy was now level with Harry and both of them were frowning intently at Smith, and going by
the panicked glint in Zach’s eye as he flicked his glance between the two young men, they must
have looked a formidable pair standing side by side united against a common enemy; Zach…
“Er… ak!” Zach shrivelled back under their heavy gazes into the headboard with his knees hugged
protectively to him and began twisting his hands and mumbling under his breath that they couldn’t
harm him for trying to protect his family… no way, Of course not… They wouldn’t…
“Well.” The Slytherin said with bright impatience. “Now there’s no excuse, Potter.” He lifted his
wand and flicked it carelessly at Zach. The boy’s eyes rolled back in his head and it flopped back
with a hard thump onto the headboard, passed out cold. “Can we go now?”
“What did you do that for?” Harry asked angrily, eyeing the unconscious Hufflepuff.
“You don’t want him to know what we’re up to do you?” Malfoy said, dismissing Harry’s concern with
a wave of his hand. “Besides, if he was awake he’d be calling Madame Pomphrey in here demanding
room service and then we’d have to deal with her too.”
“You know, you wave that thing at people way too casually for my liking. Have you ever tried
talking to people, reasoning with them?” Harry asked, eyeing the Slytherins wand warily as he
headed in search of his clothes.
Malfoy looked surprised as he raised an eyebrow. “Reason with them Potter? Why on earth would I
bother? We’re finally going then?”
Harry nodded and delicately picked up his jeans, wincing at the sharp pain in his neck and arm and
leg and … well pretty much everywhere. “I have to make a stop on the way though.”
“What? No! There isn’t time.” The Slytherin protested.
“I’m not leaving Ron believing Hermione’s dead. So save your breath. We see him first – then we’ll
go to McGonagall’s office.” Harry held up a hand as Malfoy opened his mouth scowling. “And turn
around so I can get changed.”
The Slytherin’s expression suddenly changed and gone were any traces of anger and impatience. He
lowered himself onto the edge on Harry’s bed looking in the opposite direction and plucked at the
corners of the pillow lightly. “You could give me the passwords we’ll need up there then I could get
started while you’re busy petting a morose and leaky weasel.” (He shuddered)
Harry sent the back of the blonde’s head a warning look and started awkwardly dressing. “We’re
going together – or not at all.” He warned the Slytherin grimly. There was no way he was going to
let Malfoy loose in the Head’s office to pick his way through Dumbledore’s pensive and precious
memories. Who knows what he’s left in there?
“Just a thought.” The Slytherin answered casually, yet there was a vague undertone of
defensiveness. Harry frowned to himself. Surely Malfoy didn’t think that the last two days changed
everything between them? Certainly they had seen another side to one another, but ultimately,
neither of them was about to change who they are – Malfoy least of all. Harry only had to see him
with Zach a moment ago to know that.
~*~*~*~*~
- 277 -
It was slow and painful going for Harry trying to get up to the Gryffindor tower. Malfoy seemed
twitchy and agitated at the amount of time that was passing, knowing he was going to have to get
back to the Slytherin common room before midnight. Although the fact that they were both
squeezed under Malfoy’s invisibility cloak, unavoidably rubbing shoulders and thighs in an effort to
stay hidden could have been said to antagonize the blonde further, it wasn’t doing much for Harry’s
comfort either.
Malfoy stopped grumbling and kept his mouth shut while Harry poked his head out at the Fat Lady.
Tapping his wand on her frame a couple of times to wake her up, he gave her the password and
speedily grabbed the frame as it swung open before the tired pink-clad woman dropped off again
and it closed leaving them still on the wrong side of the door. Once inside and surrounded by the
deep reds of the furnishings and the golden glow from the lamps and the fireplace, Harry breathed a
sigh of relief and took a quick look around. Seamus and Dean were sprawled on the large couch
before the fire and Pansy was huddled in a secretive chat with Crabbe and Goyle in what had
unofficially become the Slytherin corner of the common room.
Harry slipped off the cloak carefully; expecting Malfoy to stay covered and made his way over to
Seamus and Dean. They both wore the same punctured expression that went with their deflated
bodies. They looked up as Harry eased himself up to lean on the couch. The walk had left him
feeling very wobbly indeed and he was glad to have something to rest against.
“You shouldn’t be here.” Said Seamus in concern. “You look bloody awful.”
Dean wriggled forward into an upright position so he could see Harry better. “Seam’s right. You look
like the walking dead. You should be resting back in hospital. There’s nothing you can do up here,
mate.”
“Listen.” Seamus began, a sombre tone to his voice. “We really don’t know what to say…”
“Yeah.” Dean’s voice cracked and his eyes looked excessively watery. “I still can’t believe it, you
know?”
“Ron.” Was all Harry managed to croakily get out before Seamus jerked his thumb up the stairs.
“He’s in the room, with Ginny.”
“He’s taken it pretty bad.” Dean added cautiously. “He needed company, but not the sort me or
Seamus can give, so we’re dossing down here for the night. Ginny’s taken your bed.”
Harry nodded at Dean and let go of the couch, swaying and shaking as he turned and made his way
to the stairs.
“Harry.”
He tossed a look over his shoulder at Dean.
“You really ought to go back to Madame Pomphrey’s mate. There’s nout you can do and you don’t
even look like you’ll make it up the stairs.”
“Of course he will.” Came a clipped voice. They all turned to see Malfoy who had discarded the cloak
and had been huddled with Pansy and co. He was straightening from the table and heading over to
Harry with raised eyebrows. “I can levitate you if you like?”
Not on your life!
“Er… um… no, really. I’m fine. Really.” Harry couldn’t imagine anything worse than being at Malfoy’s
mercy at the end of his wand. If anything clarified what sort of relationship the two boys had in the
- 278 -
last few days, it was Harry’s unwillingness to trust Malfoy as far as he could safely toss a fully-
grown blast-ended Skrewt.
Malfoy smirked as he joined Harry at the foot of the stairs. “You Gryffindors are supposed to be all
trusting and noble, aren’t you?”
“Trusting and noble, we are.” Harry said as he started the agonizing ascent. “Blithering idiots, we’re
not.”
“Doesn’t say much for our new found friendship, now does it?” Malfoy cocked an eyebrow and
placed a hand under Harry’s arm to help propel him along a little faster.
“Speaks volumes really.” Harry replied without meeting the blonde’s eye as he limped and winced
his way along. “It might surprise you to learn, considering you see me as some dopey senseless
underachiever smothered by a hero complex with no idea how I even get up in the morning let
alone blunder my way through escaping your Dark Lord time and time again, that I actually have
enough Slytherin in me to recognize an extraordinarily risky offer made by you Malfoy – The
Slytherin Personified.”
Malfoy snorted and genuinely smiled in amusement as he shook his head. “You have about as much
Slytherin in you’re whole body as I do in my little finger. Less, in fact.”
“Tell that to the sorting hat, since I had to fight with it to stay out of Slytherin.” Harry stopped at
Malfoy’s barefaced incredulous start. “You should speak with Pansy about being to quick to label
people.”
Malfoy growled. “Where do you think she got it from in the first place? That dosey cow doesn’t have
a single thought of her own. The perfect girlfriend really.” He added in realization.
“Is there anyone you know that you have a kind word to say about?” Harry asked grumpily.
Malfoy smirked as he searched Harry’s face. Then he grabbed him by the elbow and pushed him
forward again. “Come on.” They didn’t stop again until they reached Harry’s dorm room.
“You stay out here.”
“I’ve no desire to see the Weasel blubbing over his mudblood.” The Slytherin’s lip curled in distaste
but it lacked its usual venom. “But get on with it. We’ve wasted too much time already!”
Harry turned his eyes to the ceiling and took a deep breathe before knocking lightly on the door. He
waited a moment but no sound could be heard from within and when he shot a look at Malfoy, the
other boy was flicking his head, urging him to go in. Harry sighed and opened the door, stepping
into the dimly lit room and closing the door quietly behind him.
Ron was not in bed asleep as he’d imagined, but sitting up at one of the windows, silhouetted by the
almost full moon. He didn’t turn to face Harry as he crossed the room, though a slight shift in his
arms hugging tightly to his knees let Harry know the red head knew he was there.
“Ron…” Harry said quietly and moved until he was as in-front of his best friend as he could get. He
gratefully took purchase of the sills opposite edge, perching himself there and trying to calm down
his shakes. He leaned forward to try and draw Ron’s eyes from the emptiness beyond the window.
“She’s not dead.”
At first Ron didn’t react. Maybe he had already closed off to whatever it was that Harry might have
been going to say. Harry could understand him not wanting to hear any more damning admissions
or explanations, or worse, apologies that only drove Hermione’s death home even further. So Harry
watched and waited, and when Ron finally turned his head very slowly away from the window and
met Harry’s gaze, Harry leaned in even further to make sure it got through this time and spoke in a
low voice. “She’s not dead, Ron. They didn’t kill her. Hermione’s alive. Snape took her alive.”
Ron sat as still as rock for a moment, and then his breathing suddenly became heavy as he
continued to stare at Harry. A small sob came from off to the side where Harry’s own bed was. He
- 279 -
turned to see Ginny sitting up and watching them silently with silvery streaks glistening down her
cheeks. She climbed out of bed and wordlessly walked to Harry, leaning into his chest and letting
him embrace her in his arms that trembled as he tried to tighten his grip around her.
“Are-are you…” Harry looked up at Ron’s attempted question. “H-how do you know?”
“Smith.” Harry said. “Malfoy woke him up and he told us what happened. The Avada curse was
meant for him. They wanted Hermione alive.”
“Snape took Hermione alive.” Ron’s voice suddenly changed. He seemed unable to allow himself any
real relief over the news and now his face curled in bitter anger. “Snape.” He said the name like he
was spitting poison. Harry could guess the next lot of questions out of his best friends mouth. Harry
was the one who’d had recent dealings with Snape and had even had to trust him with certain
things, like helping Malfoy for instance, but Harry did not want to have to sit through the onslaught
and accusations right now, when he was feeling just as betrayed and had no answers either.
Ron was opening his mouth to start his rant when the door opened and Malfoy strolled in. Ron’s
attention was immediately diverted to the blonde and Harry was actually thankful he’d disobeyed
Harry’s order to stay put.
“You’ve molly-coddled your followers enough. Let’s go.”
In his weakened state, Harry almost missed catching hold of Ron in an effort to stop him using
Malfoy as a punching bag to de-stress on.
“Malfoy.” Harry said wearily as he continued to hold a shaky arm across Ron’s chest, barring his
way. “I think you should leave.”
“Why?” He asked coyly. “So you can all talk about me behind my back?” He pouted ridiculously and
slipped both of his hands in his pockets, slouching against Harry’s bedpost.
“What have they done with her?” Ron bellowed too close to Harry at Malfoy. Harry winced and
eased away, waggling a finger in his right ear.
“How should I know Weasel? I’ve been here at Hogwarts haven’t I?” The Slytherin replied lazily.
“Bollocks!” Ron barked. “You and Snape are thick as thieves and he’s the one that’s got her. You
know Malfoy! I know you do.” Suddenly Ron lunged forward and fisted the front of Malfoy’s jumper,
yanking the blonde’s face closer to his. “And you’re not leaving here until you spill everything you
know.” Ron threatened.
“Ron, he was just as surprised about Snape as we are. I was there when Smith told him and he
even questioned Smith himself what Snape was doing there.” Harry interjected calmly.
Ron eyed Malfoy who merely flicked his tightly set jaw up in a move to indicate agreement. The
Slytherin still looked calm and composed with his hands still in his pockets, but Harry could see the
long line of the boys wand already in hand under the fabric and the glint of fear and adrenalin in his
eyes. He needed to diffuse this situation fast.
“Snape obviously wanted Hermione alive specifically.” Harry went on quickly. “It couldn’t have been
as bait to get to me because I was right there. The whole exercise would have become pointless and
they could have taken me there and then but they didn’t.”
Ron’s grip was loosening slightly and Malfoy edged back where he could without seeming like he
was.
“There’s got to be a reason Snape wants her. And the sooner we figure it out, the sooner we can
start looking for her.”
At Harry’s words, Ron released Malfoy completely and turned his attention on Harry and Ginny.
Malfoy adjusted his jumper with one hand and leaned back against the bedpost, his wand hand
never leaving the pocket.
- 280 -
“Why her though Harry?” Ron asked, a pained expression on his face as he wracked his brain. “How
are we ever going to figure out why Snape took her? She’s just a school kid. Merlin I wish she were
here. Its time like this we need her. She’s always been the smart one.”
“Exactly.” Ginny said tonelessly. They all looked at her and she shrugged, her eyes still red and
puffy, flicked between them. “Well, she is. And Snape knows it. Without her, getting in and out of
the next stronghold alive will be almost impossible. I mean, you couldn't have got the last Horc–”
Three sets of eyes suddenly widened in shock, while one pair narrowed.
Ginny had only just managed to stop herself from giving away to Malfoy what Harry, Ron and
Hermione had been doing for months now. She looked mortified as she clamped a hand over her
mouth, but at least she had managed to stop herself in time. But that was now the least of her
problems.
Ron’s mouth gaped open and Harry turned a furious glare on her after he darted a look at Malfoy.
How could she know what they had been doing? She had always been aware that something was
going on, but she’d never been privy to the details. Yet somehow, she had just made it known that
she was fully in the loop about past happenings, and hang on a minute – how does she know they’ll
need Hermione to get to the last Horcrux when they have no clue as to what it is – let alone where
to find it?
Ginny began to shrink under Harry’s piercing glare. They would need to have a talk. A talk? They
needed more than a little chat to get this all out in the open, but with Malfoy here, and Harry on a
mission, now was not the time. Harry could have roared aloud in frustration. What had Ginny been
up to?
“H-h-h-how…”
“Not now Ron,” Harry cut off the stunned and semi-speechless Ron, still frowning intently. He flicked
his head in Malfoy’s direction and Ron closed his mouth and swallowed. It was then that Harry
noticed Malfoy’s demeanour had completely changed. He was no longer slouching and eyeing them
all in disinterest; he was standing rigid and intensely eyeing three Gryffindors expressions. But he
said nothing.
“Er… Malfoy and I have to… go.” Harry trailed off as he began walking to the door.
“Snape would not have gone to Hogsmeade in broad daylight to abduct Granger just because she’s
the smart one out of you three.”
Harry, Ron and Ginny stared at Malfoy blankly. No one had expected him to offer any sort of opinion
on the matter, certainly not one that appeared to be trying to be helpful.
Malfoy sighed exaggeratedly. “Think about it. Firstly, if that’s all they wanted to do – hinder your
progress in whatever it is you’re doing – then killing her would take far less planning and manpower
– much easier. And why Snape? A high-ranking Death Eater, not to mention one of the most wanted
men around. He killed your beloved Dumbledore who, lets face it, has more allies than The Dark
Lord has enemies. It’s risky for him to show up in Hogsmeade. Very risky.”
“So what are you saying?” Harry asked cautiously.
Malfoy shrugged a shoulder. “I’d guess that Snape needed Hermione. For something important.
Something worth the risk. And its not you, Potter. Like you said, you were there, they could have
taken you – but they didn’t. What’s she been working on?”
The question was directed at Harry, but Ginny answered.
“No one knows. She’s been holed up in her room night after night ever since we got back to
Hogwarts. She hasn’t told any of us what she was doing.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “If it was me, and I’d just lost my best friend – forgetting the fact that
- 281 -
I’d never have a mudblood as an actual friend, let alone a best one – then I’d be looking to find out
what she’d been up to before she disappeared.”
Harry and Ron exchanged looks.
“I’ll check her room.” Ginny volunteered. “I’ll try tonight, but it might have to be in the morning.
Lavender was pretty upset about… well, you know.”
“I’m coming with you.” Ron said flatly.
“You can’t.” Ginny said hesitantly. “Boys can’t get into–”
“I’ll fly.” And with that, Ron dug his broom out of his trunk and headed to the door.
“Oh, all right. But I’d better go and warn Lavender. She’s likely to hex your ears off if you just go
bursting in there. Especially after what’s happened.”
“I’ll see you both later then.” Harry said quietly as he opened the door and waited for Malfoy to go
through before him.
As the two of them descended the spiral stairs Harry almost felt like he was going into the
Gladiators ring. He knew there was going to be confrontation tonight, he’d known it for days, but as
the time drew nearer to getting to the memory in the pensieve, an awful dread was gathering,
hanging over him like a black thunder cloud.
As they stepped back into the common room, Pansy rushed up to Draco and whispered urgently and
Draco swore loudly. A second later his eyes squeezed tightly shut and his right hand gripped his left
forearm as he dropped to his knees with a gutteral moan.
